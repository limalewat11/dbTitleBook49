Both are on the brink of terrible mistakes, but perhaps they can save each other.<br></p><p>Unsure of her impending marriage, Caroline Cliburn travels to Scotland with her younger brother Jody in tow to rethink her feelings and investigate her older brother's disappearance. An inexperienced driver, Caroline crashes during an unexpected snowstorm. Virtually uninjured from the accident, Caroline and Jody walk to the nearest home, which happens to be the estate of Oliver Cairney, a wealthy London businessman who is in town taking care of his deceased brother's affairs. Oliver graciously asks the two to spend the night, and it is obvious from the start that the wealthy Londoner has eyes for Caroline. But when a neighbor thwarts any romance between the two by informing Caroline that Oliver is practically engaged, Caroline and Jody leave hastily, without even saying goodbye. But love always finds a way, and Caroline's sudden illness throws the two would-be lovers together once more. <p> At only 245 pages, <i>Snow in April</i> may be the perfect starting point for those readers intimated by Pilcher's lengthier prose.

He is co-pastor of Fairfield Friends Meeting in Camby, Indiana.<b>Introduction<br>Discovering Your Inner Quaker<br><br></b>It is not unusual in my neck of the woods to drive down an Indiana road and happen upon an old Quaker meetinghouse, set back from the road with a cemetery nearby. The graves will date from the early 1800s to the current day, bookending the span of Quakerism in America&#x2019;s heartland. Many meetinghouses date from the mid-1800s. Given their age and the unintended message of death every graveyard conveys, passersby could be forgiven for believing Quakerism to be an antiquated tradition, out of step with the modern world.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know this misperception is a common one, for I believed it myself before becoming a Quaker; and others, who eventually became Quakers, also thought it true and told me so. To discover people still gather at those meetinghouses each Sunday, still laugh and love and learn within those serene spaces, is a surprise to those of us who believed Quakerism to be a dying expression. Not only is the mere existence of Quakerism a surprise, so are its vitality and relevance.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is more surprising is that a religious tradition as evangelically bashful as Friends is still around at all. The average Quaker, if there is such a thing, will warmly welcome a visitor once he or she arrives at a meetinghouse but would seldom have invited that person in the first place, fearing that might be construed as spiritually coercive or pushy. Instead, we rely upon our history and reputation&#x2014;and in more recent years a website called Beliefnet.com&#x2014;to evangelize for us. I first visited that website several years ago and was invited to answer a series of questions in order to determine the religion that best suited me. Intrigued, I took the quiz, submitted my answers for evaluation,and was informed I would feel most at home in a Quaker meeting. I remember chuckling to myself, pleased the test confirmed the path I had chosen over thirty-five years before.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few weeks later, a visitor arrived at our Quaker meetinghouse. After welcoming her, I asked if she had ever attended a Quaker meeting.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She answered, &#x201c;No, this is my first time. But I took a test on the Internet, and it told me I&#x2019;d be happy as a Quaker.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mentioned I had taken the same test and had been told the same thing. Many others have visited our meetinghouse since, telling the same story. This has not been unique to our meeting. In my conversations with other Quakers around the country, they have reported the same phenomena. I would later learn a significant number of the quiz respondents were advised to consider Quakerism. This confirmed a long-held suspicion of mine&#x2014;<i>there are far more people who embrace our Quaker traditions,</i> <i>testimonies, and beliefs than ever join a Quaker meeting. </i>Indeed, were everyone who is philosophically sympathetic to our tradition to join our ranks, ours might be the largest denomination in America.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because so many people were advised by Beliefnet.com to consider Quakerism, I thought perhaps a Quaker had designed the test and was using it to expand our ranks, but that turned out not to be the case. Instead, I learned many people were sympathetic to the ideals of Quakerism without realizing their convictions were shared by a somewhat obscure religious faith over 350 years old. They were Quakers but didn&#x2019;t know it.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These newcomers to Quakerism have defied easy categorization. Some have been young, others elderly. Some have been prosperous, some have struggled economically. While most have had some experience with organized religion, their experience has been broad, ranging from Roman Catholicism to Judaism to Islam to Baptist. More than a few have been agnostics, uncertain about God but appreciative of the Quaker witness to peace and social justice. Several have mentioned finding the Quaker emphasis on silent reflection helpful to their spiritual journey. One man who had lived for some time in Asia said to me, &#x201c;Quakerism might be America&#x2019;s closest thing to Buddhism.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#x2019;m not sure what to make of our newfound popularity, but I am excited the long-held priorities of Quakerism are being valued by others and hope it signals a wider commitment to the virtues we Friends have cherished and practiced for centuries. At first, I worried the growing attraction of Quakerism was a fad and would fade over time. But as I engage those drawn to the Religious Society of Friends, I am sensing other motivations.<br>They do not perceive Quakerism as fashionable or chic. <i>Rather, they have found its focus on the inner life to be an antidote to the complexities and challenges of modern life. </i>The Quaker values,<i> </i>what we call testimonies&#x2014;simplicity, peace, integrity, community,<i> </i>and equality&#x2014;offer an ethical and spiritual platform upon<i> </i>which people can happily build their lives.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is this platform, this spiritual structure, I wish to explore in the pages ahead. These Friendly testimonies are easily remembered by the acronym SPICE: simplicity, peace, integrity, community, and equality. I would be remiss in suggesting these are uniquely Quaker ideals. They were not invented by us, and people of other faiths&#x2014;or no faith at all&#x2014;have lived them out powerfully and creatively. But I do believe these values are best honed in the crucible of community, which is why I remain a Friend. That these priorities speak to so many people today, including many who have scant knowledge of Quakerism, indicates the common ground shared by ancient traditions and modern seekers. We need not jettison the time-tested truths of our ancestors, but we do need to reinterpret them for our age, lest we mistake stale forms for vital living. It is then, with deep appreciation for the past and profound hope for our future, that I offer these testimonies of the Quaker way for your consideration.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let me be clear, were I merely to inform you of this way, my job would be left undone. It is the life, <i>the Quaker way, </i>I urge you to take up and live. By that I do not mean for you to seek out the nearest Quaker meeting and become a member, though you may if you wish. I mean for you to embrace these values, to give your assent and your heart to these virtues, so that our world might be transformed. My interest is not in growing the Quaker denomination. My passion is in growing a world in which peace, love, and justice reign.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, I am not inviting you to a church but to a life.</p><h2>Modernism: A Guide to European Literature 1890-1930 (Penguin Literary Criticism)</h2><p>An exploration of the ideas, groupings and the social tensions that shaped the transformation of life caused by the changes of modernity in art, science, politics and philosophy</p><p>&#39;The Modern movement in the arts transformed consciousness and artistic form just as the energies of modernity--scientific, technological, philosophical, political--transformed for ever the nature, the speed, the sensation of human life, &#39; write the editors in their new Preface.

Especially since her father, the late police detective, was killed in the line of duty. But when an old Jewish man approaches Aim�e with a top-secret decoding job on behalf of a woman in his synagogue, Aim�e unwittingly takes on more than she was expecting. When she goes to drop off her findings at her client's house in the Marais, Paris's historic Jewish quarter, she finds the old woman strangled, a swastika carved on her forehead. With the help of her partner, Ren�, Aim�e sets out to solve this horrendous crime, but finds herself in an increasingly dangerous web of ancient secrets and buried war crimes.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><p>Cara Black is the author of eleven book in the <i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestselling Aim�e Leduc series, all of which are available from Soho Crime. She lives in San Francisco with her husband and son and visits Paris frequently.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i>Aim�e Leduc felt his presence before she saw him. As if ghosts floated in his wake in the once elegant hall. She paused, pulling her black leather jacket closer against the Parisian winter morning slicing through her building, and reached for her keys. The man emerged from the shadows by her frosted paned office door. A baby&#x2019;s cry wafted up from the floor below, then the concierge&#x2019;s door slammed.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Mademoiselle, I need your help,&#x201d; he said. Leathery, freckled skin stretched over his skull and his ears pointed out at right angles. He wore a crumpled navy blue suit and leaned crookedly on a malacca cane.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;No missing persons, Monsieur,&#x201d; she said. As winter settled, the days gray and the memories vivid, old survivors revived hopes of lost ones. She slid her tongue across her teeth to check for anything stuck, smoothed her short brown hair and smiled. She stuffed the chocolate croissant back in the bag. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t find lost relatives. My field is corporate security.&#x201d; Thirty-four years old, Aim�e, at five feet eight inches, loomed above him. &#x201c;<i>Je suis d�sol�e, </i>Monsieur, but computer forensics are my speciality.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;That&#x2019;s what I want.&#x201d; He straightened his posture slowly, his large eyes fearful. &#x201c;My name is Soli Hecht. I must talk with you.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Behind his fear she saw sadness tinged by keen perception. She tried to be polite. Walk-in clients were rare. Most came through corporate connections or by word of mouth. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not that I don&#x2019;t want your business, but we&#x2019;re carrying a full caseload. I can refer you to someone very good.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I knew your father, an honorable man. He told me to come to you if I needed help.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Startled, she dropped her keys and looked away. &#x201c;But my father was killed five years ago.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;As always, he is in my prayers.&#x201d; Hecht bowed his head. When he looked up, his eyes bored into hers. &#x201c;Your father and I met when he was in Le Commissariat.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She knew she had to hear him out. Still she hesitated. The cold seeped from the floorboards but it wasn&#x2019;t the only thing making her shiver.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Please come inside.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She unlocked the door that read <i>Leduc Detective</i> that led to the office she&#x2019;d taken over after her father&#x2019;s death, flipped on the lights, and draped her jacket over her armchair. Nineteenth-century sepia prints of Egyptian excavations hung on the walls above digitally enhanced Parisian sewer maps.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hecht moved his cadaverous frame across the parquet floor. Something about him struck her as familiar. As he lifted his arm onto her desk, she saw faint blue numbers tattooed on his forearm peeking out from his jacket sleeve. Did he want her to find Nazi loot in numbered Swiss bank accounts? She scooped ground coffee into the filter, poured water, and switched on the espresso machine, which grumbled to life.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Specifically, Monsieur Hecht, what is the job?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Computer penetration is your field.&#x201d; His eyes scanned the equipment lining the walls. He thrust a folder at her. &#x201c;Decipher this computer code. The Temple Emanuel is hiring you.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Regarding?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;We need proof that a woman&#x2019;s relatives avoided deportation to Buchenwald. But I don&#x2019;t want to raise her hopes.&#x201d; He looked away, as if there was more he could say, but didn&#x2019;t. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve stopped doing that kind of work, Monsieur Hecht. That was more my father&#x2019;s field. To be honest, if I kept his promise you&#x2019;d get less than the best.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I knew your father, I trusted him.&#x201d; Hecht gripped the edge of her desk.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;How did you know him?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;A man of honor, he told me I could rely on you.&#x201d; Soli Hecht hung his head. &#x201c;We had many dealings before the explosion. I need your expertise.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She drummed her chipped red nails on her desk and pushed the painful memories aside. Steaming muddy liquid dripped into the waiting demitasse cup. &#x201c;Monsieur, <i>un petit caf�</i>?&#x201d;<br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Non, merci.&#x201d;</i> He shook his head.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aim�e unwrapped a sugar cube and plopped it in her cup. &#x201c;I do computer security,&#x201d; she repeated. &#x201c;Not missing persons.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;He said you would help me . . . that I could always come to you.&#x201d; Short of going back on her father&#x2019;s word, one path remained.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>&#x201c;D&#x2019;accord,&#x201d;</i> she relented with inner misgivings. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll show you my standard contract form.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;My word must be enough.&#x201d; He extended his hand. &#x201c;As far as you are concerned, you don&#x2019;t know me. Agreed?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She shook his gnarled hand.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;This will take several days? I was told it could be slow work.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Maybe a few hours. I type one hundred and twenty conventional words a minute.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She smiled and sat down, shoved last night&#x2019;s faxes to the side of her desk, and leaned towards him.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You were in school in America when I knew your father.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Full of hope, she&#x2019;d searched for her American roots and the mother who&#x2019;d disappeared when she was eight. She hadn&#x2019;t found either. &#x201c;Briefly. I was an exchange student in New York.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Your father articulated his casework philosophy to me and I&#x2019;ve always remembered it.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Things weren&#x2019;t usually what they seemed or he&#x2019;d be out of business?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hecht nodded. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re independent, no ties or affiliations to anyone.&#x201d; His crooked fist drummed the table. &#x201c;I like that about you.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He knew a lot about her. She also had the distinct impression he was leaving something out. &#x201c;Our fees are seven hundred and fifty francs a day.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hecht nodded dismissively. Now she remembered. She&#x2019;d seen his photo years ago when his evidence helped bring Klaus Barbie to trial.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Look inside the folder,&#x201d; Hecht said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aim�e opened his file, noticing the digits and slash marks, a distinctive trademark of Israeli military encryption. Her expertise was in hacking into systems, huge corporate ones. But this code spoke of the Cold War&#x2014;a slippery tunneling job. She hesitated.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Two thousand francs are in the folder. Deliver your results to 64 rue des Rosiers to Lili Stein. She&#x2019;s home after her shop closes. I&#x2019;ve told her to expect a visitor.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aim�e felt she had to be honest; breaking an encrypted code had never taken her that long. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve given me too much.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He shook his head. &#x201c;Take it. She has a hard time getting around. Remember, give this only to Lili Stein.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She shrugged. &#x201c;No problem.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You must put this in Lili Stein&#x2019;s hands.&#x201d; Hecht&#x2019;s tone had changed, from fervent to pleading. &#x201c;Swear to me on your father&#x2019;s grave. On his honor.&#x201d; His eyes locked on to hers.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What kind of Holocaust secret was this? Slowly she nodded in agreement.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;We will have no more contact, Mademoiselle.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soli Hecht&#x2019;s joints cracked as he rose. His face wrinkled in pain.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You could have faxed me this query, Monsieur Hecht. It would have saved you this trip.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;But we&#x2019;ve neither talked nor met, Mademoiselle Leduc,&#x201d; he said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aim�e bit back her reply and opened the door for him. Warped floorboards, a tarnished mirror, and scuffed plaster adorned the unheated landing. She buzzed for the turn-of-the-century wire elevator grating noisily up the shaft. Slowly and painfully he made his way to the hall.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Back in her office, she stuffed the francs into her pocket. The overdue France T�l�com bill and horse meat for Miles Davis&#x2014;pronounced Meels Daveez, her bichon frise&#x2014;would wait until she&#x2019;d done the promised work.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eurocom, the cable giant, had royally screwed up her finances by breaking Leduc&#x2019;s security service contract and hiring a rival Seattle firm, the only other firm that did the same work as she and her partner. She hoped there&#x2019;d be enough money left to spring her suits from the dry cleaner&#x2019;s.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her standard software keys enabled her to crack coded encryptions.

In particular, he became fascinated with Fannie Farmer&#x2019;s <i>Boston Cooking-School Cook Book</i>. Published in 1896, it was the best-selling cookbook of its age&#x2014;full of odd, long-forgotten ingredients, fascinating details about how the recipes were concocted, and some truly amazing dishes (as well as some awful ones).<br><br>In <i>Fannie&#x2019;s Last Supper</i>, Kimball describes the experience of re-creating one of Fannie Farmer&#x2019;s amazing menus: a twelve-course Christmas dinner that she served at the end of the century. Kimball immersed himself in composing twenty different recipes&#x2014;including rissoles, Lobster � l&#x2019;Am�ricaine, Roast Goose with Chestnut Stuffing and Jus, and Mandarin Cake&#x2014;with all the inherent difficulties of sourcing unusual animal parts and mastering many now-forgotten techniques, including regulating the heat on a coal cookstove and boiling a calf&#x2019;s head without its turning to mush, all sans food processor or oven thermometer. Kimball&#x2019;s research leads to many hilarious scenes, bizarre tastings, and an incredible armchair experience for any reader interested in food and the Victorian era. <br><br><i>Fannie&#x2019;s Last Supper</i> includes the dishes from the dinner and revised and updated recipes from <i>The Boston Cooking-School Cook Book</i>. A culinary thriller. it offers a fresh look at something that most of us take for granted&#x2014;the American table.</p><p>Chris Kimball founded <em>Cook's Magazine</em> in 1980; it has grown to a paid circulation of 1,000,000. He hosts <em>America's Test Kitchen</em> and <em>Cook's Country</em>, which are the top-rated cooking shows on public television, reaching 2 million viewers per week in over 94% of American households. Kimball is a regular contributor to both the <em>Today Show</em> and the <em>CBS Early Show</em>. He has been written up in most major newspapers, many national magazines including <em>The New Yorker</em> and <em>Time</em>, and regularly contributes to NPR's <em>Morning Edition</em>, including doing a regular Thanksgiving segment. He will also host a public radio show on cooking starting in the fall of 2010.<b><i>A Culinary Time Machine</i></b><br>&nbsp;<br>A Seat at the Victorian Table<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>A high Victorian dinner party was a modern re-creation of the ancient ritual of class and culinary artistry, displaying the plumage of high society while underlining the rigid rules of proper social intercourse. It was tails for the gentlemen and full dress costume for the ladies. One was expected to arrive neither early nor more than fifteen minutes late. When dinner was announced, the guests were led in pro cession from parlor to dining room, the host escorting the honored lady of the evening. The standard twelve courses were to be served briskly, in no more than two hours, yet there were few restraints on the amount of silverware used, with up to 131 separate pieces per setting in myriad styles from neoclassical, Persian, and Elizabethan to Jacobean, Japa nese, Etruscan, and even Moorish. The rules of behavior were well known to all diners: one was never to appear greedy, draining the last drop from a wineglass or scraping the final morsel from the plate; one never ate hurriedly, which implied uncontrolled hunger; and since meal preparation was not something to be shown in public, plates were prepared out of view.<br>&nbsp;<br>Within this rigid construct, food was the creative spark, the manna for imagination, and the kitchen a place where one was at last allowed to express one&#x2019;s wildest desires. Victorian jellies with ribbons of colors and flavors, Bavarian cream fillings, and hundreds of custom molds were a culinary free-for-all, as was the sheer variety of a twelve-course menu, from oysters and champagne to fish, turtle, goose, venison, duck, chicken, beef, vegetables, salads, cakes, bonbons, coffee, and liqueurs, all carefully orchestrated from soup to crackers to provide an eclectic, wide-ranging array of tastes and textures. Among the very wealthy, these dinners occasionally crossed the line from artistic perfection to excess, with menus that included roasted lion, naked cherubs leaping out from live-nightingale pies, chimps in tuxedos feted as guests of honor, and gentlemen in black tie dining on horse back. The Victorian dinner table was a moment in time that encapsulated the dreams of a young country&#x2014;the radical pace of change from farm to city, from water to steam power, from local to international, from poor to rich&#x2014;that defined our nineteenth century, and this food, these menus, this dining experience have today remained dormant for over a century, just waiting to be rediscovered: the old cast-iron stove lit once again, the venison roasted, the geese plucked, and the dining table decorated using the furthest reaches of culinary imagination.<br>&nbsp;<br>And so, in 2007, with Fannie Farmer&#x2019;s original 1896 Boston Cooking School cookbook in hand, using a twelve-course menu printed in the back of the book and an authentic Victorian coal cookstove installed in our 1859 Boston town house, I set out on a two-year journey: to test, update, and master the cooking of Fannie Farmer&#x2019;s America, re-creating a high Victorian feast that I hoped to serve in perfect succession to a dozen celebrity guests for a televised public tele vi sion special.<br>&nbsp;<br>The project had begun with a book. It was horse chestnut brown, the color of a dark penny roux, mottled through a century of use, and measuring just 5 by 73&#x2044;4 inches. The cover had separated from the binding, and there was no printing on the front or back&#x2014;just a simple mustard yellow title on the upper spine: <i>Mrs. Lincoln&#x2019;s Boston Cook Book</i>. It was subtitled, on the inside, <i>What to Do and What Not to Do in Cooking. </i>The book was published in Boston by Roberts Brothers in 1890, seven years after the first edition; it was 536 pages. In 1896, Fannie Farmer, the new head of the Boston Cooking School, revised, updated, and expanded Mrs. Lincoln&#x2019;s work.<br>&nbsp;<br>I had found it in 1983 through an act of pure serendipity, in the library of a house I was thinking of purchasing at the top of Mine Hill Road in Fairfield, Connecticut. It was a two-story white clapboard number, more a square than a colonial rectangle, well proportioned and big enough for a small family, but no trophy house by any stretch. The former occupant, well in her eighties, had just died; she had been the German mistress of a long-departed lawyer in town who had willed her the use of the house during her lifetime. Coming up the back steps into the kitchen for our first inspection, my wife-to-be, Adrienne, and I noticed the antique gas stove, the even older four-door General Motors refrigerator, and a screen door between the kitchen and the dining room, as if the occupant had kept live chickens or goats secluded from the rest of the living quarters.<br>&nbsp;<br>As the Realtor took Adrienne on a tour of the upstairs, I sat on a window seat and read the preface of the small cookbook I&#x2019;d found abandoned on a shelf. In it, Mrs. Lincoln put forth her premise: to compile a book &#x201c;which shall also embody enough of physiology, and of the chemistry and philosophy of food.&#x201d; Hmm, that sounded quite modern to me, hardly what I might have expected from a book published in 1890. She went on to define cooking as &#x201c;the art of preparing food for the nourishment of the human body. [Cooking] must be based upon scientific principles of hygiene and what the French call the minor moralities of the house hold. The degree of civilization is often mea sured by its cuisine.&#x201d; Clearly, she was a heck of a lot more enlightened regarding cooking and diet than 99 percent of all cookbook authors today, most of whom were promising meals in minutes.<br>&nbsp;<br>Who were these Victorian cooks? Years later, while researching this book, I came across an awe-inspiring account of the Boston Food Fair of 1896. This made the contemporary Fancy Food Show look like amateur hour. A series of over-the-top meals was served, including a &#x201c;Mermaid&#x2019;s Dinner.&#x201d; There was an electric dairy in the convention hall that churned out three thousand pounds of butter each day, a towering replica of a castle to promote flour, and a giant barn with grass, trees, and a Paul Bunyan&#x2013; sized cow whose only purpose was to promote canned evaporated cream. Women queued up for free samples from two hundred different vendors: shredded wheat, cereals, gelatins, extracts, ice cream, candy, and custards. Other booths promoted shredded fish, preserved fruits, olives, baking powders, and dried meats. And then, just to remind us that we were still in the Victorian age, tucked darkly under the stairs, was the perfect dour touch: a melancholy exhibit of gravestones to remind passers by of their inevitable end. Just as today, food and cooking were at the convergence of popular entertainment and capitalism.<br>&nbsp;<br>In fact, in the late 1800s, the culinary world was on fire, as technology came to the rescue of the exhausted home cook with modern versions of classic ingredients. Powdered gelatin had recently replaced ungainly thickeners such as isinglass, made from the swim bladders of sturgeon, or Irish moss, made from seaweed, or, God forbid, calf&#x2019;s-foot jelly, a smelly proposition indeed. Jell-O was even marketing an ice-cream powder in vanilla, strawberry, chocolate, and lemon as an alternative to making the real thing. Gas stoves were coming into use, replacing dirty, high-maintenance coal cookstoves. Fruits were being shipped in from California and the Northwest, mushrooms from France, extra-virgin olive oil from Italy, and cheese from all over Eu rope, including real Parmesan and Emmanthaler. Sugar was now modern and highly refined, no longer consumed in yellow loaves, but pure white and granulated. Contemporary cookbooks, especially <i>The Epicurean </i>by Charles Ranhofer, exhibited an advanced knowledge of cooking and the assumption that home cooks were up to the task of creating elaborate masterpieces.<br>&nbsp;<br>Then a strange and self-indulgent notion struck me. Trying to understand the culinary past through old cookbooks and newspapers is a dodgy enterprise at best. A century or two from now, would historians be able to paint an accurate picture of home cooking in the early twenty-first century by reading the <i>New York Times </i>food pages or looking at Amazon best-sellers in the Cooking, Food, and Wine category? Instead, why not just cook my way back through history&#x2014;investigate the ingredients and the techniques; make the puddings, the soups, the roasts, the jellies, and the cakes; and then give myself a final exam, a twelve-course Victorian blowout dinner party that I would serve to the most interesting group of guests I could cobble together? Oh, and I should do all of this on an authentic coal cookstove from the period and make everything from scratch, including the stocks, the puff pastry, the gelatin, and the food colorings. It would be like building a culinary time machine: I could travel back through history and stand next to Fannie as she cooked, feeling the intense heat of the cast-iron stove and the chill of the thin strips of salt pork as I larded a saddle of venison, and then follow her instructions precisely as I handled a poached calf&#x2019;s brain so gently that it did not dissolve into custard.<br>&nbsp;<br>This idea was to remain nothing more than a daydream until 1991, when I moved to Boston and purchased an 1859 brick bowfront only a few blocks away from Fannie Farmer&#x2019;s home in 1896, the year that she published <i>The Boston Cooking-School Cook Book</i>. I still had to renovate the house and re -create an authentic Victorian kitchen&#x2014;all of that would take years&#x2014;but the seed had been planted. My fantasy dinner party, sleuthing the Victorian age through its recipes, was about to be born.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>PHONICS for READING - THIRD LEVEL</h2><p>The Phonics for Reading Series is carefully sequenced and gives direct instruction in phonics.

Now she and her husband Jon Halliday have written a groundbreaking biography of Mao Tse-tung. Based on a decade of research, and on interviews with many of Mao&#39;s close circle in China who have never talked before - and with virtually everyone outside China who had significant dealings with him - this is the most authoritative life of Mao ever written. It is full of startling revelations, exploding the myth of the Long March, and showing a completely unknown Mao: he was not driven by idealism or ideology; his intimate and intricate relationship with Stalin went back to the 1920s, ultimately bringing him to power; he welcomed Japanese occupation of much of China; and he schemed, poisoned and blackmailed to get his way. After Mao conquered China in 1949, his secret goal was to dominate the world. In chasing this dream he caused the deaths of 38 million people in the greatest famine in history. Combining meticulous history with the story-telling style of Wild Swans, this biography makes immediate Mao&#39;s roller-coaster life, as he intrigued and fought every step of the way to force through his unpopular decisions. The reader enters the shadowy chambers of Mao&#39;s court, and eavesdrops on the drama in its hidden recesses. Mao&#39;s character and the enormity of his behaviour towards his wives, mistresses and children are unveiled for the first time. This is an entirely fresh look at Mao in both content and approach. It will astonish historians and the general reader alike.</p><p>In the epilogue to her biography of Mao Tse-tung, Jung Chang and her husband and cowriter Jon Halliday lament that, "Today, Mao's portrait and his corpse still dominate Tiananmen Square in the heart of the Chinese capital." For Chang, author of <i>Wild Swans</i>, this fact is an affront, not just to history, but to decency. <i>Mao: The Unknown Story</i> does not contain a formal dedication, but it is clear that Chang is writing to honor the millions of Chinese who fell victim to Mao's drive for absolute power in his 50-plus-year struggle to dominate China and the 20th-century political landscape. From the outset, Chang and Halliday are determined to shatter the "myth" of Mao, and they succeed with the force, not just of moral outrage, but of facts. The result is a book, more indictment than portrait, that paints Mao as a brutal totalitarian, a thug, who unleashed Stalin-like purges of millions with relish and without compunction, all for his personal gain. Through the authors' unrelenting lens even his would-be heroism as the leader of the Long March and father of modern China is exposed as reckless opportunism, subjecting his charges to months of unnecessary hardship in order to maintain the upper hand over his rival, Chang Kuo-tao, an experienced military commander. <p> Using exhaustive research in archives all over the world, Chang and Halliday recast Mao's ascent to power and subsequent grip on China in the context of global events. Sino-Soviet relations, the strengths and weakness of Chiang Kai-shek, the Japanese invasion of China, World War II, the Korean War, the disastrous Great Leap Forward, the vicious Cultural Revolution, the Vietnam War, Nixon's visit, and the constant, unending purges all, understandably, provide the backdrop for Mao's unscrupulous but invincible political maneuverings and betrayals. No one escaped unharmed. Rivals, families, peasants, city dwellers, soldiers, and lifelong allies such as Chou En-lai were all sacrificed to Mao's ambition and paranoia. Appropriately, the authors' consciences are appalled. Their biggest fear is that Mao will escape the global condemnation and infamy he deserves. Their astonishing book will go a long way to ensure that the pendulum of history will adjust itself accordingly. <i>--Silvana Tropea</i><br><br> </p> <b> 10 Second Interview: A Few Words with Jung Chang and Jon Halliday</b><br><br> <b>Q:</b> From idea to finished book, how long did <i>Mao: The Unknown Story</i> take to research and write?<br> <b>A:</b> Over a decade.<br><br> <b>Q:</b> What was your writing process like? How did you two collaborate on this project?<br> <b>A:</b> The research shook itself out by language. Jung did all the Chinese-language research, and Jon did the other languages, of which Russian was the most important, as Mao had a long-term intimate relationship with Stalin. After our research trips around the world, we would work in our separate studies in London. We would then rendezvous at lunch to exchange discoveries.<br><br> <b>Q:</b> Do you have any thoughts about how the book is, or will be received in China? Did that play a part in your writing of the book?<br> <b>A:</b> The book is banned in China, because the current Communist regime is fiercely perpetuating the myth of Mao. Today Mao's portrait and his corpse still dominate Tiananmen Square in the heart of Beijing, and the regime declares itself to be Mao's heir. The government blocked the distribution of an issue of <i>The Far Eastern Economic Review</i>, and told the magazine's owners, Dow Jones, that this was because that issue contained a review of our book. The regime also tore the review of our book out of <i>The Economist</i> magazine that was going to (very restricted) newsstands. We are not surprised that the book is banned. The regime's attitude had no influence on how we wrote the book. We hope many copies will find their way into China.<br><br> <b>Q:</b> What is the one thing you hope readers get from your book?<br> <b>A:</b> Mao was responsible for the deaths of well over 70 million Chinese in peacetime, and he was bent on dominating the world. As China is today emerging as an economic and military power, the world can never regard it as a benign force unless Beijing rejects Mao and all his legacies. We hope our book will help push China in this direction by telling the truth about Mao. <b> Breakdown of a BIG Book: 5 Things You'll Learn from <i>Mao: The Unknown Story</i></b><br> <p> <b>1.</b> Mao became a Communist at the age of 27 for purely pragmatic reasons: a job and income from the Russians.<br><br> <b>2.</b> Far from organizing the Long March in 1934, Mao was nearly left behind by his colleagues who could not stand him and had tried to oust him several times.

A closeted gay man, Bast had a crush on the brooding, unknown actor and had a brief fling with him. This work records their close friendship, Dean's rise to stardom and the years following his premature death at age 24. Dean's troubled life is well documented, and Bast isn't interested in repeating his previous <i>James Dean, a Biography</i>, written in 1956. At the time, Bast was loathe to reveal his homosexuality or Dean's affairs with men. He now hopes to make up for his "youthful shortcomings and omissions." The hook is Dean's sexuality, which Bast explores in detail, discounting his relationships with women and focusing on those with men, including a stint with a notorious "chicken hawk," an older man who fancies younger guys (Bast quotes Dean saying of the union, "I paid my way"). This simple, heartfelt book records Bast's coming out and the long-term impact Dean had on his life. 16-page b&amp;w photo insert not seen by <i>PW</i>. <i>(Apr.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Such was his progress that he was ordained by Bishop Hall at the age of nineteen.<br><br>His first charge was in Stoke Newington, Middlesex, where he remained for seven years. Testimony to his remarkable gifts is found in the pages of his Practical Exposition of James which is based on his weekday lectures there.<br><br>Called to succeed Obadiah Sedgwick in the better-known pulpit of Covent Garden in London, his ministry came to be widely appreciated. He served as a chaplain to the Lord Protector, Oliver Cromwell, and also as one of the 'Triers responsible for the supervision of the Christian ministry. Yet Manton was firmly opposed to the execution of Charles I, causing considerable offence by preaching before Parliament from Deuteronomy 33:4-5.<br><br>Moses commanded us a law, even the inheritance of the congregation of Jacob. And he was king in Jeshurun, when the heads of the people and the tribes of Israel were gathered together.<br>Later he was instrumental in the restoration of Charles II and became a Royal Chaplain. But when offered the Deanery of Rochester he chose rather to suffer with his Puritan brethren in the Great Ejection of 1662.<br><br>Preaching thereafter in his own home he was imprisoned for his ministry. Such was Manton's character, however, that when the custodian-in-charge was absent he was given the keys to the gaol.<br><br>Manton died in 1677, after a lifetime of rich and practical biblical ministry.

Kolchin takes a broad geographical perspective, putting American slavery in the context of a general trend toward use of forced labor on the periphery of an expanding Europe.This incisive synthesis fills a major gap for the general reader and for historians, who will find it both stimulating and appealing.<br><br></p><p><br>Peter Kolchin, professor of history at the University of Delaware, is the author of <i>First Freedom: The Responses of Alabama's Blacks to Emancipation and Reconstruction </i>(1972) and <i>Unfree Labor: American Slavery and Russian Serfdom</i> (1987), which won the prestigious Bancroft Prize for 1988<br><br>In a lively interpretive history, Kolchin (History/Univ. of Delaware) succinctly traces America's institution of slavery from its Colonial beginnings to the Reconstruction era. American slavery, Kolchin explains, didn't develop in isolation but evolved as part of a trend toward forced labor in the New World colonies, especially in the Caribbean and Brazil. In Colonial America, ``the initial demand for labor was precisely that--for labor--and was largely color-blind.'' Most forced laborers were indentured servants from Great Britain; although some slavery existed as early as the founding, in the early 17th century, of the Virginia colony, not until that century's close were Africans imported in large numbers as slaves. Kolchin reveals that, while the plantation slavery of what was to become the South developed distinctively (and primarily to cultivate tobacco and cotton), it had much in common with the plantation slavery of the Caribbean (where sugar was the primary crop). By about 1770, American slavery was concentrated mostly in the South, though it existed in all of the American colonies, and, as time passed, relationships between slaves and masters changed as second- generation slaves lost much of their African culture and became Americanized. In the US--in contrast to the Caribbean--slaves lived longer, developed considerable occupational diversity, and became acculturated, particularly in their absorption of Protestantism. The Revolutionary era saw slavery threatened by Enlightenment ideology, but the institution survived more strongly than ever in the South and, during the 19th century, came to be perceived as fundamental to the Southern economy and way of life. Kolchin writes about slave life through the Civil War, and, not surprisingly, he sees slavery as leaving a legacy that has persisted throughout our own century. A clear and briskly written survey that puts slavery in context and explains its continuing impact on American life. -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

He lives in Galway, Ireland.<br>*Starred Review* In his third case, Galwegian ex-cop Jack Taylor--<i>The Guards</i> (2002), <i>The Killing of the Tinkers</i> (2003--buries some old friends and enemies while meeting some intriguing new ones, thanks to the addition of pills to his coterie of demons (booze, cocaine, and books). This time Jack's progress toward self-destruction is slowed both by a desultory search for a fallen angel linked to a hellish Catholic laundry and by his probe into the black habits of a sexually voracious widow. The series' real draw, though, has never been the story lines; rather, it's the eclectic, lyrical screeds pouring forth from the narrator's ruined heart. Some readers may balk at Taylor's constant literary references (in the midst of a beating, he descants on Henry Green, a "writers' writer's writer"), but these allusions are fueled by the same hard spiritual and physical thirst for sublimity that make him such a compelling existential antihero, not to mention a handy readers' advisor. Suffice it to say that fans of Roddy Doyle, James Sallis, Samuel Beckett, Irvine Welsh, Frederick Exley, Patrick McCabe, George Pelecanos, Ian Rankin, and Chuck Palahniuk will all find something to like, love, or obsess over in this stiff shot of evil chased with heartbreaking irony.

He shines a light on Marx&#x2019;s influences, explains his political and intellectual interventions, and builds on the legacy of his thought. Liedman shows how Marx&#x2019;s masterpiece, <i>Capital</i>, illuminates the essential logic of a system that drives dizzying wealth, grinding poverty, and awesome technological innovation to this day.</p><p>Compulsively readable and meticulously researched, <i>A World to Win</i> demonstrates that, two centuries after Marx&#x2019;s birth, his work remains the bedrock for any true understanding of our political and economic condition.</p></p><p><b>Sven-Eric Liedman</b>, Professor Emeritus of the History of Ideas at the University of Gothenburg, has been reading and writing about Karl Marx for over fifty years.

These objects, and the dozens of others featured in this book, elicit nods of recognition and smiles of deep satisfaction, as we recognize the classic outlines, the reassuring elegance, the essential perfection of each one.</p><p> Whether it is the cool, hand-hugging shape of the original Coke bottle, the aerodynamic glory of the Harley-Davidson ElectraGlide Motorcycle, the simple satisfaction of the peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwich, or the fluid pleasure of the Mont Blanc fountain pen, the feelings inspired by a truly quintessential object reach far beyond its original use - as need makes way for desire.</p><p> In 65 captivating essays, each one accompanied by a lush photograph, the authors explore the astonishing quality that might be labeled "soul," or simply "rightness" -but is best described by the word that possesses the very quality it defines: Quintessence. Yes, this is a book about the things that make for style and constancy in out lives, but it is more than that. It is a book about the rare quality that turns the goods of our lives into objects sublime, exemplary, and lasting. What does a Slinky toy have in common with a Goodyear Blimp?

You want a change. You&#x2019;ve seen too much death&#x2019;</b><br><br>In Fleming&#x2019;s seventh 007 novel, a private assignment sets Bond on the trail of an enigmatic criminal mastermind &#x2013; Auric Goldfinger. But greed and power have created a deadly opponent who will stop at nothing to get what he wants.</p><p><p>Ian Fleming (1908-1964), creator of the world's best-known secret agent, is the author of fourteen James Bond books. Born in London in 1908 and educated at Eton and Sandhurst, he became the Reuters Moscow correspondent in 1929. In the spring of 1939, Fleming went back to Moscow as a special correspondent for the <b>London Times</b>. In June of that same year, he joined Naval Intelligence and served throughout World War II, finally earning the rank of Commander, RNVSR (Sp.). Much of the James Bond material was drawn directly from Fleming's experiences as an intelligence officer. Later, Fleming became a consultant on foreign affairs for the <b>London Sunday Times</b>, by which time he had become far better known as the creator of James Bond.</p><b>1. REFLECTIONS IN A DOUBLE BOURBON</b> <p>James Bond, with two double bourbons inside him, sat in the final departure lounge of Miami Airport and thought about life and death.</p> <p>It was part of his profession to kill people. He had never liked doing it and when he had to kill he did it as well as he knew how and forgot about it. As a secret agent who held the rare double-0 prefix&#x2014;the licence to kill in the Secret Service - it was his duty to be as cool about death as a surgeon. If it happened, it happened. Regret was unprofessional&#x2014;worse, it was death watch beetle in the soul.</p> <p>And yet there had been something curiously impressive about the death of the Mexican. It wasn't that he hadn't deserved to die. He was an evil man, a man they call in Mexico a capungo. A capungo is a bandit who will kill for as little as forty pesos, which is about twenty-five shillings&#x2014;though probably he had been paid more to attempt the killing of Bond&#x2014;and, from the look of him, he had been an instrument of pain and misery all his life. Yes, it had certainly been time for him to die; but when Bond had killed him, less than twenty-four hours before, life had gone out of the body so quickly, so utterly, that Bond had almost seen it come out of his mouth as it does, in the shape of a bird, in Haitian primitives.</p> <p>What an extraordinary difference there was between a body full of person and a body that was empty! Now there is someone, now there is no one. This had been a Mexican with a name and an address, an employment card and perhaps a driving licence. Then something had gone out of him, out of the envelope of flesh and cheap clothes, and had left him an empty paper bag waiting for the dustcart. And the difference, the thing that had gone out of the stinking Mexican bandit, was greater than all Mexico.</p> <p>Bond looked down at the weapon that had done it. The cutting edge of his right hand was red and swollen. It would soon show a bruise. Bond flexed the hand, kneading it with his left. He had been doing the same thing at intervals through the quick plane trip that had got him away. It was a painful process, but if he kept the circulation moving the hand would heal more quickly. One couldn't tell how soon the weapon would be needed again. Cynicism gathered at the corners of Bond's mouth.</p> <p>'National Airlines, Airline of the Stars', announces the departure of their flight NA 106 to La Guardia Field, New York. Will all passengers please proceed to gate number seven. All aboard, please.'</p> <p>The Tannoy switched off with an echoing click. Bond glanced at his watch. At least another ten minutes before Transamerica would be called. He signalled to a waitress and ordered another double bourbon on the rocks. When the wide, chunky glass came, he swirled the liquor round for the ice to blunt it down and swallowed half of it. He stubbed out the butt of his cigarette and sat, his chin resting on his left hand, and gazed moodily across the twinkling tarmac to where the last half of the sun was slipping gloriously into the Gulf.</p> <p>The death of the Mexican had been the finishing touch to a bad assignment, one of the worst&#x2014;squalid, dangerous and without any redeeming feature except that it had got him away from headquarters.</p> <p>A big man in Mexico had some poppy fields. The flowers were not for decoration. They were broken down for opium, which was sold quickly and comparatively cheaply by the waiters at a small cafe in Mexico City called the 'Madre de Cacao'. The Madre de Cacao had plenty of protection. If you needed opium you walked in and ordered what you wanted with your drink. You paid for your drink at the caisse and the man at the caisse told you how many noughts to add to your bill. It was an orderly commerce of no concern to anyone outside Mexico. Then, far away in England, the Government, urged on by the United Nations' drive against drug smuggling, announced that heroin would be banned in Britain. There was alarm in Soho and also among respectable doctors who wanted to save their patients agony. Prohibition is the trigger of crime. Very soon the routine smuggling channels from China, Turkey and Italy were run almost dry by the illicit stockpiling in England. In Mexico City, a pleasant-spoken Import and Export merchant called Blackwell had a sister in England who was a heroin addict. He loved her and was sorry for her and, when she wrote that she would die if someone didn't help, he believed that she wrote the truth and set about investigating the illicit dope traffic in Mexico. In due course, through friends and friends of friends, he got to the Madre de Cacao and on from there to the big Mexican grower. In the process, he came to know about the economics of the trade, and he decided that if he could make a fortune and at the same time help suffering humanity he had found the Secret of Life. Blackwell's business was in fertilisers. He had a warehouse and a small plant and a staff of three for soil testing and plant research. It was easy to persuade the big Mexican that, behind this respectable front, Blackwell's team could busy itself extracting heroin from opium. Carriage to England was swiftly arranged by the Mexican. For the equivalent of a thousand pounds a trip, every month one of the diplomatic couriers of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs carried an extra suitcase to London. The price was reasonable. The contents of the suitcase, after the Mexican had deposited it at the Victoria Station left-luggage office and had mailed the ticket to a man called Schwab, c/o Boox-an-Pix, Ltd, WCI, were worth twenty thousand pounds.</p> <p>Unfortunately Schwab was a bad man, unconcerned with suffering humanity. He had the idea that if American juvenile delinquents could consume millions of dollars' worth of heroin every year, so could their Teddy boy and girl cousins. In two rooms in Pimlico, his staff watered the heroin with stomach powder and sent it on its way to the dance halls and amusement arcades.</p> <p>Schwab had already made a fortune when the CID Ghost Squad got on to him. Scotland Yard decided to let him make a little more money while they investigated the source of his supply. They put a close tail on Schwab and in due course were led to Victoria Station and thence to the Mexican courier. At that stage, since a foreign country was concerned, the Secret Service had had to be called in and Bond was ordered to find out where the courier got his supplies and to destroy the channel at source.</p> <p>Bond did as he was told. He flew to Mexico City and quickly got to the Madre de Cacao. Thence, posing as a buyer for the London traffic, he got back to the big Mexican. The Mexican received him amiably and referred him to Blackwell. Bond had rather taken to Blackwell. He knew nothing about Blackwell's sister, but the man was obviously an amateur and his bitterness about the heroin ban in England rang true. Bond broke into his warehouse one night and left a thermite bomb. He then went and sat in a cafe a mile away and watched the flames leap above the horizon of rooftops and listened to the silver cascade of the fire-brigade bells. The next morning he telephoned Blackwell. He stretched a handkerchief across the mouthpiece and spoke through it.</p> <p>' Sorry you lost your business last night. I'm afraid your insurance won't cover those stocks of soil you were researching.'</p> <p>'Who's that? Who's speaking?' 'I'm from England. That stuff of yours has killed quite a lot of young people over there. Damaged a lot of others. Santos won't be coming to England any more with his diplomatic bag. Schwab will be in jail by tonight. That fellow Bond you've been seeing, he won't get out of the net either. The police are after him now.'</p> <p>Frightened words came back down the line.</p> <p>'All right, but just don't do it again. Stick to fertilisers.'</p> <p>Bond hung up.</p> <p>Blackwell wouldn't have had the wits. It was obviously the big Mexican who had seen through the false trail. Bond had taken the precaution to move his hotel, but that night, as he walked home after a last drink at the Copacabana, a man suddenly stood in his way. The man wore a dirty white linen suit and a chauffeur's white cap that was too big for his head. There were deep blue shadows under Aztec cheekbones. In one corner of the slash of a mouth there was a toothpick and in the other a cigarette. The eyes were bright pin-pricks of marihuana.</p> <p>'You like woman? Make jigajig?'</p> <p>'No.'</p> <p>'Coloured girl? Fine jungle tail?'</p> <p>&#x2018;No.'</p> <p>'Mebbe pictures?'</p> <p>The gesture of the hand slipping into the coat was so well known to Bond, so full of old dangers that when the hand flashed out and the long silver finger went for his throat. Bond was on balance and ready for it.</p> <p>Almost automatically, Bond went into the 'Parry Defence against Underhand Thrust' out of the book. His right arm cut across, his body swivelling with it. The two forearms met mid-way between the two bodies, banging the Mexican's knife arm off target and opening his guard for a crashing short-arm chin jab with Bond's left. Bond's stiff, locked wrist had not travelled far, perhaps two feet, but the heel of his palm, with fingers spread for rigidity, had come up and under the man's chin with terrific force. The blow almost lifted the man off the sidewalk. Perhaps it had been that blow that had killed the Mexican, broken his neck, but as he staggered back on his way to the ground, Bond had drawn back his right hand and slashed sideways at the taut, offered throat. It was the deadly hand-edge blow to the Adam's apple, delivered with the fingers locked into a blade, that had been the standby of the Commandos.

The pain and the funniness somehow add up to something entirely good, entirely noble and entirely loveable.&#39; - Stephen Fry Sunday Times Humour Book of the Year Winner of the Books Are My Bag Non-Fiction Book of the Year Winner of Blackwell&#39;s Debut Book of the Year Winner of iBooks&#39; Book of the Year Welcome to the life of a junior doctor: 97-hour weeks, life and death decisions, a constant tsunami of bodily fluids, and the hospital parking meter earns more than you. Scribbled in secret after endless days, sleepless nights and missed weekends, Adam Kay&#39;s This is Going to Hurt provides a no-holds-barred account of his time on the NHS front line. Hilarious, horrifying and heartbreaking, this diary is everything you wanted to know - and more than a few things you didn&#39;t - about life on and off the hospital ward. This audiobook contains an exclusive interview with Adam Kay by comedian and author Mark Watson, an afterword and updated bonus diary entries.</p><p>Adam Kay is an award-winning comedian and writer for TV and film, including Mitchell &amp; Webb and Very British Problems. He previously worked as a junior doctor, detailing his funny and sad experiences in his first book, This is Going to Hurt. He lives in west London.Uniquely funny and unexpectedly heartbreaking -- Adam Hills Kay intersperses horror stories from the NHS front line with blissfully brilliant wordplay * Daily Mail * Brutally funny . . . jaw-dropping * New Statesman * At once hilarious and shocking, moving and irreverent, This Is Going to Hurt is a book that demands to be read. Adam Kay's deft comic tone is a brilliant counterpoint to his most serious of intents: to impress upon us the importance of the NHS in our lives and the irreversible damage being inflicted upon it by indifferent governments. -- Maggie O'Farrell All of human life is contained in these diaries . . . hilarious, horrifying * Prima * Brilliant -- Mark Haddon, author of <i>The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time</i> This is a brilliant book -- Russell Howard Laugh-out-loud funny . . . I found myself laughing in horror over and over, but Kay's poignant final act brought me to tears. This is a valuable window into the life of a junior doctor that should be required reading for all -- Sarah Shaffi * Stylist * Hilarious . . . a complete eye-opener * Red * A heartening, laugh-out-loud confessional on the indignities and quiet joys of being a junior doctor . . . Anchoring the wisecracks is Kay's heartfelt respect for Britain's junior doctors and the ignoble realities of a noble profession. At a time of anxiety over the future of the NHS, Kay's warts-and-all account will not only bring plenty of laughs but also delivers a moving report from the NHS's embattled frontline' * Financial Times * Funny, tragic, uplifting and brimming with bodily fluids (sorry) . . . Kay makes for a compelling bedfellow as he explores the terrifying world of the amazing men and women (just about) holding the NHS together -- Francesca Brown * Stylist * Stayed up half the night laughing out loud over painfully smart, honest doctor diaries -- Emma Donoghue, author of <i>Room</i> Things I have done while reading this book: laughed aloud (too many times to count), read a passage to a stranger on a train (this was perhaps inadvisable but could not be helped), been consistently bowled over by the detail of Dr Kay's sharp prose &amp; remarkably observant journey in a job so many of us have no real understanding of. It's an important book, a boots-on-the-ground memoir true to its title-but it's a good hurt I was left with upon turning the last page, the kind that resonates with empathy and consequence -- Ryan Gattis, author of <i>Safe</i> and <i>All Involved</i> Hilarious, poignant, depressing and shocking. Kay is such a brilliantly talented writer he manages to be both deadly serious and hilarious at the same time. Piles of this book should be in every GP surgery waiting room and A&amp;E department in the country. Heartbreaking, dazzling, brutally honest -- Bridget Christie An urgent, devastating yet truly funny account of life at the coalface of the NHS. This Is Going to Hurt had me laughing, crying and open-mouthed - in horror and in awe - by turn of page -- Lisa Owens, author of <i>Not Working</i> This made me laugh out loud and cry in equal measures. Adam's book weaves in and out of his patients' lives and in so doing he tells, in a better narrative than I have ever seen before, of the pain and joy of working so close to despair, disease and death. It's a quite brilliant book and will soothe the sorrows of many junior (and senior) doctors and remind us all why we entered this wonderful profession. A must read for patients too - lifting the bonnet on the working life of your jobbing hospital doctor -- Prof Clare Gerada MBE, past chair of the Royal College of General Practitioners<b></b> Hilarious from the first page - very, very funny. I loved it -- Kit Wharton, author of <i>Emergency Admissions</i> This should be required reading for anyone who works in, uses or even voices an opinion about the NHS. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll laugh some more, you'll think twice about ever reproducing -- Dean Burnett, author of <i>The Idiot Brain</i> By turns witty, gruesome, alarming, and touching. Always illuminating and searingly honest -- Jonathan Dimbleby Superb. Unusual and funny and sad -- Pam Ayres What a hilarious, stomach-churning, thought-provoking heartbreaker of a book. I loved every single page -- Jill Mansell If we lose the NHS, Adam Kay's diary of his him as a junior doctor will become a historical record of a unique, empathy-powered machine, and make it not just one of the funniest books I've ever read, but one of the saddest, too -- David Whitehouse A scurrilously funny, poignant and fascinatingly horrific tale of being torn to pieces and spat out by the strangely loveable but graceless monster that is the NHS -- Milton Jones As a hypochondriac I was worried about reading Adam Kay's book. Luckily it's incredibly funny - so funny, in fact, that it gave me a hernia from laughing -- Joe Lycett This is a ferociously funny book, but beneath the sheen of brilliant one-liners is a passionate, acutely personal examination of what the health service does for us, and what we're in danger of doing to it -- Mark Watson Horrifyingly hilarious and hilariously horrifying -- Danny Wallace Much like the NHS itself, this book is filled with hope, despair, miracles, catastrophe and acres of the sharpest gallows humour. A very funny book with a very sobering message -- Chris Addison By turns hilarious, shocking, heartbreaking and humbling -- John Niven What an amazing book. I laughed so hard and often I nearly choked, but it's also very moving and important. Everyone should read it. -- Cathy Rentzenbrink Unputdownable. You must read this book if you like reading, like laughing or love our NHS. It's a spit-your-tea-out-laughing clarion call to stand up for our junior doctors with all our might -- Shappi Khorsandi Hilarious and heartbreaking . . . I howled, yelped and occasionally choked with laughter . . . It's an invigorating addition to the vogue for medical memoirs. I like to think of it sitting on a shelf next to Henry Marsh, Atul Gawande and Paul Kalanithi, turning the air bluer and bluer. It has something of all those writers, but with an added dash of a profane Adrian Mole . . . This book may hurt, but in an important and necessary way -- Cathy Rentzenbrink * The Times * The humour is unflinching in its darkness . . . Yet I did laugh. A lot. Kay is a skilful, muscular writer, his narrative swinging from laugh-out- loud anecdotes to tales of sheer horror. The book's title is harrowingly apt . . . In the end, this book is a call to arms. That the NHS lost Kay is a tragedy. That this diary was written well before the Government's battle with junior doctors is more disturbing still * i * A funny, excoriatingly revealing, beautiful book -- Dawn French Blisteringly funny, politically enraging and often heartbreaking . . . hilarious . . . brimming not just with humour but with humanity . . . This should be a wake-up call to all who value the NHS -- Hannah Beckerman * Sunday Express * As hilarious as it is heartbreaking - and it IS heartbreaking (also hilarious) -- Charlie Brooker Finally a true picture of the harrowing, hilarious and ultimately chaotic life of the junior doctor in all its gory glory, dark comedy and unavoidable sadness. A blisteringly funny account shot through with harrowing detail, many pertinent truths and the humanity we all hope doctors conceal behind their unflappable exteriors. -- Jo Brand You will laugh, cry and be overwhelmed with gratitude for the medical profession who work so shockingly hard to patch us up and prolong our lives * Daily Express * Painfully funny. The pain and the funniness somehow add up to something entirely good, entirely noble and entirely loveable. -- Stephen Fry So clinically funny and politically important for supporters of the NHS that it should be given out on prescription * Guardian * I'd prescribe this book to anyone and everyone. It's laugh-out-loud funny, heartbreakingly sad and gives you the lowdown on what it's like to be holding it together while serving on the front line of our beloved but beleaguered NHS. It's wonderful -- Jonathan Ross</p><h2>Architecture After Modernism (World of Art)</h2><p><p><strong>An examination of the architectural world and its theories since the late 1960s in the context of social and political issues. It looks at a broad survey of buildings, but focuses on specific "megaprojects" as examples for discussion: the Disney empire and its amusement parks in the context of public space and the IBA in Berlin in the context of domestic space.</strong></p> Its discussion of the reshaping of urban environment focuses on London's Dockland, the most ambitious and politically sensitive development in postwar Britain. It also considers the work of lesser-known designers and women architects as well as famous international stars.</p><p>Since the Modern Movement began to be challenged in the late 1960s, architecture has followed a number of widely divergent paths. In this thoughtful and eloquent book, Diane Ghirardo examines the architectural world of the last quarter-century and its theories in the crucial context of social and political issues. Within a survey of a broad range of buildings, she focuses on specific &#39;megaprojects&#39; as paradigms for discussion. In the realm of public space, she argues, the key questions are raised by the Disney empire and its amusement parks; in domestic space, by the IBA in Berlin, with projects ranging from new structures to rehabilitation and residents&#39; self-build. When it comes to reconfiguring the urban sphere, the megaproject is London&#39;s Docklands, the most ambitious and politically sensitive development in postwar Britain. Her text ranges world-wide, and she considers the work of lesser-known designers and women architects as well as famous international stars.Diane Ghirardo is a Professor of Architecture at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles.</p><h2>Big Book of Unschooling</h2><p>Summary of Sandra Dodd&#39;s website on unschooling and mindful parenting, with hundreds of practical ideas about how to move from schoolish thinking to living a life of natural learning and joy.</p><p></p><h2>Loveability: Knowing How to Love and Be Loved</h2><p>&#34;Love is your destiny.It is the purpose of your life.

Those who succumbed to it have acquired godlike powers, but now follow a far from divine gospel as they advance inexorably from world to world.<br> On planets and asteroids, individuals battle for survival against the strange and brutal forces unleashed upon the universe. Governments teeter on the brink of anarchy, the Confederation Navy is dangerously over-stretched, and a dark messiah prepares to invoke his own version of the final Night.<br> In such desperate times the last thing the galaxy needs is a new and terrifyingly powerful weapon. Yet Dr. Alkad Mzu is determined to retrieve the Alchemist -- so she can complete her thirty-year-old vendetta to slay a star. Which means Joshua Calvert has to find Dr Mzu and bring her back before the Alchemist can be reactivated.<br> But he's not alone in the chase, and there are people on both sides who have their own ideas about how to use the ultimate doomsday device.<br> THE NEUTRONIUM ALCHEMIST is the second novel in the Night's Dawn Trilogy, an extraordinary feat of storytelling on a truly epic scale.</p><p>Now the primeval evil has left Lalonde behind to spread its malign presence across the unsuspecting worlds of the Confederation. The possessed have acquired a chilling range of superhuman powers that can defeat most conventional weapons. Technology cannot defeat them. Fear multiplies like wildfire across the planets and asteroid settlements which make up the Human Confederation, the precursor to conquest and surrender. But even surrender fails to bring an end to the torment, for the possessed will not stop their campaign until their victory is absolute, with every living human taken.Against this force the Confederation Navy is struggling to contain the threat, a battle it will ultimately lose. It seems as if individuals can make very little difference. Then out of history, Dr Alkad Mzu returns with the Neutronium Alchemist, the single most destructive weapon ever built. And she is determined to use it to avenge the death of her homeworld. It falls on Captain Joshua Calvert to try and stop her, but he&#x2019;s not the only one hunting her down in an increasingly lethal universe. And not everyone thinks the doomsday device should be neutralized.Peter F. Hamilton was born in Rutland, England in 1960.

Few of the artworks known as <i>n&#x101; hulu ali&#x2018;i,</i> or royal feathers, survive today except in museums and private collections. Through photographs and scholarly essays, <i>Royal Hawaiian Featherwork</i> highlights approximately seventy-five rare examples of the finest featherwork capes and cloaks (<i>&#x2018;ahu&#x2018;ula</i>) extant, as well as royal staffs of feathers (<i>k&#x101;hili</i>), feather lei (<i>lei hulu manu</i>), helmets (<i>mahiole</i>), feathered god images (<i>akua hulu manu</i>), and related eighteenth- and nineteenth-century paintings and works on paper. </p><p>With their brilliant coloring and abstract compositions of crescents, triangles, circles, quadrilaterals, and lines, the artworks are both beautiful and rich in cultural significance. In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, featherworks were key items of indigenous Hawaiian diplomacy, used to secure political alliances and agreements, worn as battlefield regalia, and seized as spoils from defeated chiefs. Later, in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the featherworks&#x2015;used in trading and gifts to foreign visitors&#x2015;became symbols of Hawaiian heritage and cultural pride.</p><p>This stunningly illustrated volume also serves as the catalogue to accompany the first exhibition of Hawaiian featherwork to be staged on the U.S. continent, scheduled for a six-month run starting in late August 2015 at the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco. The book and exhibition provide an overdue opportunity for the public to discover the central role these artworks played in the culture and history of the Hawaiian Islands, to explore their unparalleled technical craftsmanship, and to discover an aesthetic tradition unique to the Hawaiian archipelago.</p><p>Essays by: Samuel M.

Under the lion banner of St Mark, she created an empire of ports and naval bases which funnelled the goods of the world through its wharfs. In the process the city became the richest place on earth - a brilliant mosaic fashioned from what it bought, traded, borrowed and stole. <br><br>Based on first hand accounts of trade and warfare, seafaring and piracy and the places where Venetians sailed and died, <i>City of Fortune</i> is narrative history at its finest. Beginning on Ascension Day in the year 1000 and ending with an explosion off the coast of Greece - and the calamitous news that the Portuguese had pioneered a sea route to India - it will fascinate anyone who loves Venice and the Mediterranean world.</p><p>Roger Crowley read English at Cambridge before going to live in Istanbul.

At its most northern point, in the enormous curved bay called the Gulf of Venice, the water is a curious blue-green. Here the river Po churns out tons of alluvial material from the distant Alps, which settle to form haunting stretches of lagoon and marsh. So great is the volume of these glacial deposits that the Po Delta is advancing fifteen feet a year and the ancient port of Adria, after which the sea is named, now lies fourteen miles inland.<br><br>Geology has made the Adriatic's two coasts quite distinct. The western, Italian shore is a curved, low-lying beach, which provides poor harbors but ideal landing spots for would-be invaders. Sail due east and your vessel will snub against limestone. The shores of Dalmatia and Albania are a four-hundred-mile stretch as the crow flies, but so deeply crenellated with sheltering coves, indents, offshore islands, reefs, and shoals that they comprise two thousand miles of intricate coast. Here are the sea's natural anchorages, which may shelter a whole fleet or conceal an ambush. Behind these features, sometimes stepped back by coastal plain, sometimes hard down on the sea, stand the abrupt white limestone mountains that barricade the sea from the upland Balkans. The Adriatic is the frontier between two worlds.<br><br>For thousands of years-from the early Bronze Age until well after the Portuguese rounded Africa-this fault line was a marine highway linking central Europe with the eastern Mediterranean, and a portal for world trade. Ships passed up and down the sheltering Dalmatian shore with the goods of Arabia, Germany, Italy, the Black Sea, India, and the farthest East. Over the centuries they carried Baltic amber to the burial chamber of Tutankhamen; blue faience beads from Mycenae to Stonehenge; Cornish tin to the smelters of the Levant; the spices of Malacca to the courts of France; Cotswold wool to the merchants of Cairo. Timber, slaves, cotton, copper, weapons, seeds, stories, inventions, and ideas sailed up and down these coasts. "It is astonishing," wrote a thirteenth-century Arab traveler about the cities of the Rhine, "that although this place is in the Far West, there are spices there which are to be found only in the Far East- pepper, ginger, cloves, spikenard, costus, and galanga, all in enormous quantities." They came up the Adriatic. This was the point where hundreds of arterial routes converged. From Britain and the North Sea, down the river Rhine, along beaten tracks through the Teutonic forests, across Alpine passes, mule trains threaded their way to the top of the gulf, where the merchandise of the East also landed. Here goods were transshipped and ports flourished; first Greek Adria, then Roman Aquileia, and finally Venice. In the Adriatic, site is everything: Adria silted up; Aquileia, on the coastal plain, was flattened by Attila the Hun in 452; Venice prospered in the aftermath because it was unreachable. Its smattering of low-lying muddy islets set in a malarial lagoon was separated from the mainland by a few precious miles of shallow water. This unpromising place would become the entrep�t and interpreter of worlds; the Adriatic, its passport.<br><br>._._.<br><br>From the start the Venetians were different. The first, rather idyllic snapshot we have of them, from the Byzantine legate Cassiodorus in 523, suggests a unique way of life, independent and democratic:<br><br>You possess many vessels . . . [and] . . . you live like seabirds, with your homes dispersed . . . across the surface of the water. The solidity of the earth on which they rest is secured only by osier and wattle; yet you do not hesitate to oppose so frail a bulwark to the wildness of the sea. Your people have one great wealth-the fish, which suffices for them all. Among you there is no difference between rich and poor; your food is the same, your houses are alike. Envy, which rules the rest of the world, is unknown to you. All your energies are spent on your salt fields; in them indeed lies your prosperity, and your power to purchase those things which you have not. For though there may be men who have little need of gold, yet none live who desire not salt.<br><br>The Venetians were already carriers and suppliers of other men's needs. Theirs was a city grown hydroponically, conjured out of marsh, existing perilously on oak palings sunk in mud. It was fragile to the sea's whim, impermanent. Beyond the mullet and eels of the lagoon, and its salt pans, it produced nothing-no wheat, no timber, little meat. It was terribly vulnerable to famine; its sole skills were navigation and the carrying of goods. The quality of its ships was critical.<br><br>Before Venice became the wonder of the world, it was a curiosity; its social structure, enigmatic; and its strategies, distrusted. Without land, there could be no feudal system, no clear division between knight and serf. Without agriculture, money was its barter. Its nobles would be merchant princes who could command a fleet and calculate profit to the nearest grosso. The difficulties of life bound all its people together in an act of patriotic solidarity that required self-discipline and a measure of equality-like the crew of a ship all subject to the perils of the deep.<br><br>Geographical position, livelihood, political institutions, and religious affiliations marked Venice out. It lived between two worlds: the land and the sea, the East and the West, yet belonging to neither. It grew up a subject of the Greek-speaking emperors in Constantinople and drew its art, its ceremonials, and its trade from the Byzantine world. Yet the Venetians were also Latin Catholics, nominal subjects to the pope, Byzantium's anti-Christ. Between such opposing forces they struggled to maintain a particular freedom. The Venetians repeatedly defied the pope, who responded by excommunicating the whole city. They resisted tyrannous solutions to government and constructed for themselves a republic, led by a doge, whom they shackled with so many restraints that he could receive no gift from foreigners more substantial than a pot of herbs. They were intolerant of overambitious nobles and defeated admirals, whom they exiled or executed, and devised a voting system to check corruption as labyrinthine as the shifting channels of their lagoon.<br><br>The tenor of their relations with the wider world was set early. The city wished to trade wherever profit was to be made without fear or favor. This was their rationale and their creed and they pleaded it as a special case. It earned them widespread distrust. "They said many things to excuse themselves . . . which I do not recollect," spat a fourteenth-century churchman after watching the Republic wriggle free of yet another treaty (though he could undoubtedly remember the details painfully well), "excepting that they are a quintessence and will belong neither to the Church nor to the emperor, nor to the sea nor to the land." The Venetians were in trouble with both Byzantine emperors and popes as early as the ninth century for selling war materials to Muslim Egypt, and while purportedly complying with a ban on trade with Islamic countries around 828, they managed to spirit away the body of Saint Mark from Alexandria under the noses of Muslim customs officials, hidden in a barrel of pork. Their standard excuse was commercial necessity: "because we cannot live otherwise and know not how except by trade." Alone in all the world, Venice was organized for economic ends.<br><br>By the tenth century they were selling Oriental goods of extraordinary rarity at the important fairs at Pavia on the river Po: Russian ermine, purple cloth from Syria, silk from Constantinople. One monkish chronicler had seen the emperor Charlemagne looking drab beside his retinue in Oriental cloth bought in Pavia from Venetian merchants. (Particularly singled out for clerical tut-tutting was a multicolored fabric interwoven with the figures of birds-evidently an item of outrageous foreign luxury.) To the Muslims Venice traded back timber and slaves-literally Slavs until that people became Christian. Venice was by now well placed at the head of the Adriatic to become the pivot of trade, and on the round turning of the millennium, Ascension Day in the year 1000, Doge Pietro Orseolo II, a man who "excelled almost all the ancient doges in knowledge of mankind," set sail on an expedition that would launch the Republic's ascent to wealth, power, and maritime glory.<br><br>On the threshold of the new era, the city stood finely poised between danger and opportunity. Venice was not yet the compact mirage of dazzling stone that it would later become, though its population was already substantial. No splendid palazzi flanked the great S bend of the Grand Canal. The city of wonder, flamboyance, and sin, of carnival masks and public spectacle lay centuries ahead. Instead, low wooden houses, wharves, and warehouses fronted the water. Venice comprised less a unity than a succession of separate islets with patches of undrained marsh and open spaces among the parish settlements, where people grew vegetables, kept pigs and cows, and tended vines. The Church of Saint Mark, a plain predecessor of the extraordinary basilica, had recently been badly burned and patched up after political turmoil that had left a doge dead in its porch; the square in front of it was beaten earth, divided by a canal and partially given over to an orchard. Seagoing vessels that had sailed to Syria and Egypt crowded the commercial heart of the city, the Rivo Alto-contracted over time into the Rialto. Everywhere masts and spars protruded above the buildings.<br><br>It was the genius of Orseolo to fully understand that Venice's growth, perhaps its very survival, lay far beyond the waters of the lagoon. He had already obtained favorable trading agreements with Constantinople, and, to the disgust of militant Christendom, he dispatched ambassadors to the four corners of the Mediterranean to strike similar agreements with the Islamic world. The future for Venice lay in Alexandria, Syria, Constantinople, and the Barbary Coast of North Africa, where wealthier, more advanced societies promised spices, silk, cotton, and glass-luxurious commodities that the city was ideally placed to sell on into northern Italy and central Europe. The problem for Venetian sailors was that the voyage down the Adriatic was terribly unsafe. The city's home waters, the Gulf of Venice, lay within its power, but the central Adriatic was risky to navigate, as it was patrolled by Croat pirates. Since the eighth century these Slav settlers from the upper Balkans had established themselves on its eastern, Dalmatian shores. This was a terrain made for maritime robbery. From island lairs and coastal creeks, the shallow-draft Croat ships could dart out and snatch merchant traffic passing down the strait.<br><br>Venice had been conducting a running fight with these pirates for 150 years. The contest had yielded little but defeat and humiliation. One doge had been killed leading a punitive expedition; thereafter the Venetians had opted to pay craven tribute for free passage to the open seas. The Croats were now seeking to extend their influence to the old Roman towns farther up the coast. Orseolo brought to this problem a clear strategic vision that would form the cornerstone of Venetian policy for all the centuries that the Republic lived. The Adriatic must provide free passage for Venetian ships, otherwise they would be forever bottled up. The doge ordered that there would be no more tribute and prepared a substantial fleet to command obedience.<br><br>Orseolo's departure was accompanied by one of those prescient ceremonies that became a defining marker of Venetian history. A large crowd assembled for a ritual mass at the Church of Saint Peter of Castello, near the site of the present arsenal. The bishop presented the doge with a triumphal banner, which perhaps depicted for the first time Saint Mark's lion, gold and rampant on a red background, crowned and winged, ready for war even as the open gospel between his paws declares peace. The doge and his force then stepped aboard, and with the west wind billowing in their sails, surged out of the lagoon into the boisterous Adriatic. Stopping only to receive further blessing from the bishop of Grado they set sail for the peninsula of Istria on the eastern tip of the Adriatic.<br><br>Orseolo's campaign could almost serve as the template for subsequent Venetian policy: a mixture of shrewd diplomacy and the precise application of force. As the fleet worked its way down the small coastal cities-from Parenzo to Pola, Ossero to Zara-the citizens and bishops came out to demonstrate their loyalty to the doge and to bless him with their relics. Those who wavered, weighing Venice against the counterthreat of the Slavs, were more readily convinced by the visible show of force. The Croats saw what was coming and tried to buy the doge off. Orseolo was not to be turned, though his task was made harder by the coastal terrain. The pirates' stronghold was well protected, hidden up the marshy delta of the Narenta River and beyond the reach of any strike force. It was shielded by the three barrier islands of Lesina, Curzola, and Lagosta, whose rocky fortresses presented a tough obstacle.<br><br>Relying on local intelligence, the Venetians ambushed a shipload of Narentine nobles returning from trade on the Italian shore and used them to force submission from the Croats at the mouth of the delta. The latter swore to forgo the annual tribute and harassment of the Republic's ships. Only the offshore islands held out. The Venetians isolated them one by one and dropped anchor in their harbors. Curzola was stormed. Lagosta, "by whose violence the Venetians who sailed through the seas were very often robbed of their goods and sent naked away," offered more stubborn resistance. The inhabitants believed their rocky citadel to be impregnable. The Venetians unleashed a furious assault on it from below; when that failed, a detachment made their way up by a steep path behind the citadel and captured the towers that contained the fort's water supply. The defense collapsed. The people were led away in chains and their pirates' nest was demolished.<br><br>With this force de frappe, Orseolo put down a clear marker of Venetian intentions, and in case any of the subject cities had forgotten their recent vows, he retraced his footsteps, calling at their startled ports in a repeat show of strength, parading hostages and captured banners. "Thence, passing again by the aforesaid town, making his way back to Venice, he at length returned with great triumph." Henceforward, the doge and his successors awarded themselves a new honorific title-Dux Dalmatiae-"Lord of Dalmatia."</p><h2>SYSTEMS /ANGLAIS (DOCUMENTS OF CO)</h2><p>Part of the acclaimed 'Documents of Contemporary Art' series of anthologies . To better understand the possible futures of art, you need to know the stuff in this book. - Sarah Cook, new media art historian, curator and co-author of Rethinking Curating: Art after New Media. In the 1960s many artists, composers, musicians and architects began to embrace open systems that emphasise organism over mechanism, dynamic processes of interaction among elements, and the participants role as an inextricable part of aesthetic experience. This anthology traces this radical shift from its roots in systems and information theories, cybernetics and artificial intelligence to current cutting-edge science. It also explores the ways in which systems-based art projects can create self-generating entities and networks, alter our experience of time, change the configurations of social relations, cross cultural borders, and interact with threatened ecosystems. Artists surveyed include: Roy Ascott, Brian Eno, Frank Gillette, Hans Haacke, Newton Harrison &amp; Helen Mayer Harrison, Ken Rinaldo, Toms Saraceno, Sonia Landy Sheridan, Christa Sommerer &amp; Laurent Mignonneau, Woody &amp; Steina Vasulka, Stephen Willats and Iannis Xenakis.

Navasky knows just how transformative&#x2014;and incendiary&#x2014;cartoons can be. Here Navasky guides readers through some of the greatest cartoons ever created, including those by George Grosz, David Levine, Herblock, Honor<b>�&nbsp;</b>Daumier, and Ralph Steadman.&nbsp;&nbsp;He recounts how cartoonists and caricaturists have been censored, threatened, incarcerated, and even murdered for their art, and asks what makes this art form, too often dismissed as trivial, so uniquely poised to affect our minds and our hearts.<br><br>Drawing on his own encounters with would-be censors, interviews with cartoonists, and historical archives from cartoon museums across the globe, Navasky examines the political cartoon as both art and polemic over the centuries. We see afresh images most celebrated for their artistic merit (Picasso's <i>Guernica, </i>Goya's "Duendecitos"),&nbsp;images that provoked outrage (the 2008 Barry Blitt&nbsp;<i>New Yorker</i>&nbsp;cover, which depicted the Obamas as a Muslim and a Black Power militant fist-bumping in the Oval Office), and those that have dictated public discourse (Herblock&#x2019;s defining portraits of McCarthyism, the Nazi periodical&nbsp;<i>Der St�rmer</i>&#x2019;s&nbsp;anti-Semitic caricatures). Navasky ties together these and other superlative genre examples to reveal how political cartoons have been not only capturing the zeitgeist throughout history but shaping it as well&#x2014;and how the most powerful cartoons retain the ability to shock, gall, and inspire long after their creation.<br>Here Victor S.&nbsp;Navasky brilliantly illuminates the true power of one of our most enduringly vital forms of artistic expression.</p></p><p><p>Victor S.

Part of women&#x2019;s allegedly inferior, deficient or fragile biology, their brains were at the heart of any explanation as to why they were lower down any scale, from the evolutionary to the social and the intellectual. The inferior nature of women&#x2019;s brains was used as the rationale for frequently proffered advice that the fairer sex should focus on their reproductive gifts and leave education, power, politics, science and any other business of the world to men.<br> &nbsp;<br> While views about women&#x2019;s capabilities and their role in society varied somewhat over the centuries, a consistent theme throughout was &#x201c;essentialism,&#x201d; the idea that differences between female and male brains were part of their &#x201c;essence,&#x201d; and that these brains&#x2019; structures and functions were fixed and innate. Gender roles were determined by these essences. It would be going against nature to overturn this natural order of things.<br> &nbsp;<br> An early version of this story starts, but unfortunately does not end, with a seventeenth-century philosopher, Fran�ois Poullain de la Barre, bravely questioning the alleged inequality of the sexes. Poullain was determined to have a clear-eyed look at the evidence behind the assertion that women were inferior to men, and was careful not to accept anything as true just because it was how things had always been (or because some appropriate explanation could be found in the Bible).<br> &nbsp;<br> His two publications, <i>On the Equality of the Two Sexes: A Physical and Moral Discourse in Which Is Seen the Importance of Undoing Prejudice in Oneself </i>(1673) and <i>On the Education of Women, to Guide the Mind in Sciences and Manners </i>(1674), show a startlingly modern approach to issues of differences between the sexes. Poullain even tries to show how women&#x2019;s skills can be equated with those of men; there&#x2019;s a charming section in his treatise on sexual equality where he muses that the skills required of embroidery and needlework are as demanding as those required to learn physics.<br> &nbsp;<br> Based on his studies of findings from the then new science of anatomy, he made a startlingly prescient observation: &#x201c;Our most accurate anatomical investigations do not uncover any difference between men and women in this part of the body [the head]. The brain of women is exactly like ours.&#x201d; His close examination of the different skills and dispositions of men and women, boys and girls, drew him to the conclusion that, given the opportunity, women would be just as capable of benefiting from the privileges which were then only offered to men, such as education and training. For Poullain, there was no evidence that women&#x2019;s inferior position in the world was due to some biological deficit. &#x201c;<i>L&#x2019;esprit n&#x2019;a point de sexe,</i>&#x201d; he declared: the mind has no sex.<br> &nbsp;<br> Poullain&#x2019;s conclusions were strongly against the prevailing ethos; at the time of his writing, the patriarchal system was firmly entrenched. The &#x201c;separate spheres&#x201d; ideology, with men fit for public roles and women for private, domestic ones, determined a woman&#x2019;s inferiority, necessarily subordinate to her father and then to her husband, and physically and mentally weaker than any man.<br> &nbsp;<br> It was downhill all the way after that. Poullain&#x2019;s views were largely, to his disappointment, ignored when they were first published (at least in France), and had little impact on the established view that women were essentially inferior to men, and would be unable to benefit from educational or political opportunities (which was, of course, a self-fulfilling prophecy, as they were not, with notable exceptions, given access to education or political opportunities). This remained the prevailing view throughout the eighteenth century, with little attention to it as a matter worthy of debate.</p><h2>Gregory, the Terrible Eater (Reading Rainbow)</h2><p>Mother Goat, alarmed by Gregory&#39;s bizarre dietary preferences--he prefers toast and scrambled eggs to shoe boxes and tin cans--consults Dr. Ram, who devises an appetizing transitional diet for little Gregory</p><p>Mitche ll Sharmat says the idea for this story<br>was planted while on vacation years ago, when a<br>young goat started nibbling on his son's coat.

It tells the story of a intransigent young architect, his violent battle against conventional standards, and his explosive love affair with a beautiful woman who struggles to defeat him. Leonard Peikoff, Rand&#39;s literary executor, adds a special afterword that includes excerpts from the author&#39;s notes on the classic work. Reissue.</p><p><i>The Fountainhead</i> has become an enduring piece of literature, more popular now than when published in 1943. On the surface, it is a story of one man, Howard Roark, and his struggles as an architect in the face of a successful rival, Peter Keating, and a newspaper columnist, Ellsworth Toohey. But the book addresses a number of universal themes: the strength of the individual, the tug between good and evil, the threat of fascism. The confrontation of those themes, along with the amazing stroke of Rand's writing, combine to give this book its enduring influence.Ayn Rand is the author of <i>Atlas Shrugged</i>. Her first novel, <i>We the Living</i>, was published in 1936, followed by <i>Anthem</i>. With the publication of <i>The Fountainhead</i> in 1943, she achieved a spectacular and enduring success. Through her novels and nonfiction writing, Rand - who died in 1982 - maintains a lasting influence on popular and scholarly thought.</p><h2>Gulag Archipelago 1918-1956</h2><p><b>[This is the MP3CD audiobook format of VOLUME 1 in vinyl case.]</b> <br><br> **Time Magazine's Best Nonfiction Book of the 20th Century**<br><br> In this masterpiece, Solzhenitsyn has orchestrated thousands of incidents and individual histories into one narrative of unflagging power and momentum.

But never before has such an array of golfing advice been pulled together in one place. Donald Trump, himself an avid&#x2014;and very good&#x2014;golfer, asked his friends, colleagues, and playing companions to offer thoughts on everything from the mental game to the swing to putting to playing golf the right way. And golfers being what they are, none could resist sharing words of wisdom.<br><br>So here we find Vijay Singh telling us about playing simply: &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t need to get your golf swing by going through video cameras and stuff like that.

At the heart of this story are two intensely ambitious men: Nelson Rockefeller, scion of the liberal and immensely wealthy Standard Oil family, and William Cameron Townsend, founder of the ultraconservative Wycliffe Bible Translators. Although leaders of opposing camps, they found common cause in the struggle against fascism and then communism, with the result that hundreds of thousands of Amazonian tribespeople died or were displaced. The systematic campaign of colonization fathered by Rockefeller and Townsend was a chilling foreshadowing of American intervention in the Third World to secure valuable natural resources in the name of democracy.<p>Kevin Stillwell is an actor that has voiced a number of audiobooks, including" Careless Love", " Last Train to Memphis", " The First Assassin", " The Millionaire Affair", and others.

John Grady Cole is the last bewildered survivor of long generations of Texas ranchers. Finding himself cut off from the only life he has ever wanted, he sets out for Mexico with his friend Lacey Rawlins. Befriending a third boy on the way, they find a country beyond their imagining: barren and beautiful, rugged yet cruelly civilized; a place where dreams are paid for in blood. &#34;All The Pretty Horses&#34; is an acknowledged masterpiece and a grand love story: a novel about childhood passing, along with innocence and a vanished American age. Steeped in the wisdom that comes only from loss, it is a magnificent parable of responsibility, revenge and survival. &#39;A darkly shining work ...executed with consummate skill and much subtlety the effect is magnificent&#39; - John Banville, &#34;Observer&#34;. &#39;A uniquely brilliant book ...told in language as subtly beautiful as its desert setting. One of the most important pieces of American writing of our time&#39; - Stephen Amidon, &#34;Sunday Times&#34;.</p><p>Part bildungsroman, part horse opera, part meditation on courage and loyalty, this beautifully crafted novel won the National Book Award in 1992. The plot is simple enough. John Grady Cole, a 16-year-old dispossessed Texan, crosses the Rio Grande into Mexico in 1949, accompanied by his pal Lacey Rawlins. The two precocious horsemen pick up a sidekick--a laughable but deadly marksman named Jimmy Blevins--encounter various adventures on their way south and finally arrive at a paradisiacal <i>hacienda</i> where Cole falls into an ill-fated romance. Readers familiar with McCarthy's Faulknerian prose will find the writing more restrained than in <i>Suttree</i> and <i>Blood Meridian</i>. Newcomers will be mesmerized by the tragic tale of John Grady Cole's coming of age.6 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>The Five Books of Moses: The Schocken Bible, Volume I (The Schocken Bible , Vol 1)</h2><p>Widely acclaimed by Bible scholars and theologians of every denomination, Everett Fox&#39;s masterful translation re-creates the echoes, allusions, alliterations, and wordplays of the Hebrew original.

Linda exploresthat turbulent time in <i>The Yankee Widow.</i><br><br><em>Early December, 1914</em><br><br>If the spark-throwing screech of iron-on-iron hadn't wrenched Clay McKettrick out of his uneasy sleep, the train's lurching stop&#x2014;which nearly pitched him onto the facing seat&#x2014;would surely have done the trick.<br><br>Grumbling, Clay sat up straight and glowered out the window, shoving splayed fingers through his dark hair.<br><br>Blue River, Texas. His new home. And more, for as the new marshal, he'd be responsible for protecting the town and its residents.<br><br>Not that he could see much of it just then, with all that steam from the smokestack billowing between the train and the depot.<br><br>The view didn't particularly matter to him, anyhow, since he'd paid a brief visit to the town a few months back and seen what there was to see&#x2014;which hadn't been much, even in the sun-spangled, blue-sky days of summer. Now that winter was coming on&#x2014;Clay's granddad, Angus, claimed it snowed dust and chiggers in that part of Texas&#x2014;the rutted roads and weathered facades of the ramshackle buildings would no doubt be of bleak appearance.<br><br>With an inward sigh, Clay stood to retrieve his black, round-brimmed hat and worn duster from the wooden rack overhead. In the process, he allowed himself to ponder, yet again, all he'd left behind to come to this place at the hind end of beyond and carve out a life of his own making.<br><br>He'd left plenty.<br><br>A woman, to start with. And then there was his family, the sprawling McKettrick clan, including his ma and pa, Chloe and Jeb, his two older sisters and the thriving Triple M Ranch, with its plentitude of space and water and good grass.<br><br>A fragment of a Bible verse strayed across his brain. <em>The cattle on a thousand hills...</em><br><br>There were considerably fewer than a thousand hills on the Triple M, big as it was, but the cattle were legion.<br><br>To his granddad's way of thinking, those hills and the land they anchored might have been on loan from the Almighty, but everything else&#x2014;cows, cousins, mineral deposits and timber included&#x2014;belonged to Angus Mc-Kettrick, his four sons and his daughter, Katie.<br><br>Clay shrugged into the long coat and put on his hat. His holster and pistol were stowed in his trunk in the baggage compartment, and his paint gelding, Outlaw, rode all alone in the car reserved for livestock.<br><br>The only other passenger on board, an angular woman with severe features and no noticeable inclination toward small talk, remained seated, with the biggest Bible Clay had ever seen resting open on her lap. She seemed poised to leap right into the pages at the first hint of sin and disappear into all those apocalyptic threats and grand promises. According to the conductor, a fitful little fellow bearing the pitted scars of a long-ago case of smallpox, the lady had come all the way from Cincinnati with the express purpose of saving the heathen.<br><br>Clay&#x2014;bone-tired, homesick for the ranch and for his kinfolks, and wryly amused, all of a piece&#x2014;nodded a respectful farewell to the woman as he passed her seat, resisting the temptation to stop and inquire about the apparent shortage of heathens in Cincinnati.<br><br>Most likely, he decided, reaching the door, she'd already converted the bunch of them, and now she was out to wrestle the devil for the whole state of Texas. He wouldn't have given two cents for old scratch's chances.<br><br>A chill wind, laced with tiny flakes of snow, buffeted Clay as he stepped down onto the small platform, where all three members of the town council, each one stuffed into his Sunday best and half-strangled by a celluloid collar, waited to greet the new marshal.<br><br>Mayor Wilson Ponder spoke for the group. "Welcome to Blue River, Mr. McKettrick," the fat man boomed, a blustery old cuss with white muttonchop whiskers and piano-key teeth that seemed to operate independently of his gums.<br><br>Clay, still in his late twenties and among the youngest of the McKettrick cousins, wasn't accustomed to being addressed as "mister"&#x2014;around home, he answered to "hey, you"&#x2014;and he sort of liked the novelty of it. "Call me Clay," he said.<br><br>There were handshakes all around.<br><br>The conductor lugged Clay's trunk out of the baggage car and plunked it down on the platform, then busily consulted his pocket watch.<br><br>"Better unload that horse of yours," he told Clay, in the officious tone so often adopted by short men who didn't weigh a hundred pounds sopping wet, "if you don't want him going right on to Fort Worth. This train pulls out in five minutes."<br><br>Clay nodded, figuring Outlaw would be ready by now for fresh air and a chance to stretch his legs, since he'd been cooped up in a rolling box ever since Flagstaff.<br><br>Taking his leave from the welcoming committee with a touch to the brim of his hat and a promise to meet them later at the marshal's office, he crossed the small platform, descended the rough-hewn steps and walked through cinders and lingering wisps of steam to the open door of the livestock car. He lowered the heavy ramp himself and climbed into the dim, horse-scented enclosure.<br><br>Outlaw nickered a greeting, and Clay smiled and patted the horse's long neck before picking up his saddle and other gear and tossing the lot of it to the ground beside the tracks.<br><br>That done, he loosed the knot in Outlaw's halter rope and led the animal toward the ramp. Some horses balked at the unfamiliar, but not Outlaw. He and Clay had been sidekicks for more than a decade, and they trusted each other in all circumstances.<br><br>Outside, in the brisk, snow-dappled wind, having traversed the slanted iron plate with no difficulty, Outlaw blinked, adjusting his unusual blue eyes to the light of midafternoon. Clay meant to let the gelding stand unte-thered while he put the ramp back in place, but before he could turn around, a little girl hurried around the corner of the brick depot and took a competent hold on the lead rope.<br><br>She couldn't have been older than seven, and she was small even for that tender age. She wore a threadbare calico dress, a brown bonnet and a coat that, although clean, had seen many a better day. A blond sausage curl tumbled from inside the bonnet to gleam against her forehead, and she smiled with the confidence of a seasoned wrangler.<br><br>"My name is Miss Edrina Nolan," she announced importantly. "Are you the new marshal?"<br><br>Amused, Clay tugged at his hat brim to acknowledge her properly and replied, "I am. Name's Clay McKettrick."<br><br>Edrina put out her free hand. "How do you do, Mr. McKettrick?" she asked.<br><br>"I do just fine," he said, with a little smile. Growing up on the Triple M, he and all his cousins had been around horses all their lives, so the child's remarkable ease with a critter many times her size did not surprise him.<br><br>It was impressive, though.<br><br>"I'll hold your horse," she said. "You'd better help the railroad man with that ramp. He's liable to hurt himself if you don't."<br><br>Clay looked back over one shoulder and, sure enough, there was the banty rooster of a conductor, struggling to hoist that heavy slab of rust-speckled iron off the ground so the train could get under way again. He lent his assistance, figuring he'd just spared the man a hernia, if not a heart attack, and got a glare for his trouble, rather than thanks.<br><br>Since the fellow's opinion made no real never-mind to Clay either way, he simply turned back to the little girl, ready to reclaim his horse.<br><br>She was up on the horse's back, her faded skirts billowing around her, and with the snow-strained sunlight framing her, she looked like one of those cherub-children gracing the pages of calendars, Valentines and boxes of ready-made cookies.<br><br>"Whoa, now," he said, automatically taking hold of the lead rope. Given that he hadn't saddled Outlaw yet, he was somewhat mystified as to how she'd managed to mount up the way she had. Maybe she really was a cherub, with little stubby wings hidden under that thin black coat.<br><br>Up ahead, the engineer blew the whistle to signal imminent departure, and Outlaw started at the sound, though he didn't buck, thank the good Lord.<br><br>"Whoa," Clay repeated, very calmly but with a note of sternness. It was then that he spotted the stump on the other side of the horse and realized that Edrina must have scrambled up on that to reach Outlaw's back.<br><br>They all waited&#x2014;man, horse and cherub&#x2014;until the train pulled out and the racket subsided somewhat.<br><br>Edrina smiled serenely down at him. "Mama says we'll all have to go to the poorhouse, now that you're here," she announced.<br><br>"Is that so?" Clay asked mildly, as he reached up, took the child by the waist and lifted her off the horse, setting her gently on her feet. Then he commenced to collecting Outlaw's blanket, saddle and bridle from where they'd landed when he tossed them out of the railroad car, and tacking up. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw the town-council contingent straggling off the platform.<br><br>Edrina nodded in reply to his rhetorical question, still smiling, and the curl resting on her forehead bobbed with the motion of her head. "My papa was the marshal a while back," she informed Clay matter-of-factly, "but then he died in the arms of a misguided woman in a room above the Bitter Gulch Saloon and left us high and dry."<br><br>Clay blinked, wondering if he'd mistaken Edrina Nolan for a child when she was actually a lot older. Say, forty.<br><br>"I see," he said, after clearing his throat. "That's unfortunate. That your papa passed on, I mean." Clay had known the details of his predecessor's death, having been regaled with the story the first time he set foot in Blue River, but it took him aback that Edrina knew it, too.<br><br>She folded her arms and watched critically as he threw on Outlaw's beat-up saddle and put the cinch through the buckle. "Can you shoot a gun and everything?" she wanted to know.<br><br>Clay spared her a sidelong glance and a nod. Why wasn't this child in school? Did her mother know she was running loose like a wild Indian and leaping onto the backs of other people's horses when they weren't looking?<br><br>And where the heck had a kid her age learned to ride like that?<br><br>"Good," Edrina said, with a relieved sigh, her little arms still folded. "Because Papa couldn't be trusted with a firearm. Once, when he was cleaning a pistol, meaning to go out and hunt rabbits for stew, it went off by accident and made a big hole in the floor. Mama put a chair over it&#x2014;she said it was so my sister, Harriet, and I wouldn't fall in and wind up under the house, with all the cobwebs and the mice, but I know it was really because she was embarrassed for anybody to see what Papa had done. Even Harriet has more sense than to fall in a hole, for heaven's sake, and she's only five."<br><br>Clay suppressed a smile, tugged at the saddle to make sure it would hold his weight, put a foot into the stirrup and swung up. Adjusted his hat in a gesture of farewell. "I'll be seeing you, chatterbox," he said kindly.<br><br>"What about your trunk?" Edrina wanted to know. "Are you just going to leave it behind, on the platform?"<br><br>"I mean to come back for it later in the day," Clay explained, wondering why he felt compelled to clarify the matter at all. "This horse and I, we've been on that train for a goodly while, and right now, we need to stretch our muscles a bit."<br><br>"I could show you where our house is," Edrina persisted, scampering along beside Outlaw when Clay urged the horse into a walk. "Well, I guess it's <em>your</em> house now."<br><br>"Maybe you ought to run along home," Clay said. "Your mama's probably worried about you."<br><br>"No," Edrina said. "Mama has no call to worry. She thinks I'm in school."<br><br>Clay bit back another grin.<br><br>They'd climbed the grassy embankment leading to the street curving past the depot and on into Blue River by then. The members of the town's governing body waddled just ahead, single file, along a plank sidewalk like a trio of black ducks wearing top hats.<br><br>"And why <em>aren't</em> you in school?" Clay inquired affably, adjusting his hat again, and squaring his shoulders against the nippy breeze and the swirling specks of snow, each one sharp-edged as a razor.<br><br>She shivered slightly, but that was the only sign that she'd paid any notice at all to the state of the weather. While Miss Edrina Nolan pondered her reply, Clay maneuvered the horse to her other side, hoping to block the bitter wind at least a little.<br><br>"I already know everything they have to teach at that school," Edrina said at last, in a tone of unshakable conviction. "And then some."<br><br>Clay chuckled under his breath, though he refrained from comment. It wasn't as if anybody were asking his opinion.<br><br>The first ragtag shreds of Blue River were no more impressive than he recalled them to be&#x2014;a livery on one side of the road, and an abandoned saloon on the other. Waisthigh grass, most of it dead, surrounded the latter; craggy shards of filthy glass edged its one narrow window, and the sign above the door dangled by a lone, rusty nail.<br><br>Last Hope: Saloon and Games of Chance, it read in painted letters nearly worn away by time and weather.<br><br>"You shouldn't be out in this weather," Clay told Edrina, who was still hiking along beside him and Outlaw, eschewing the broken plank sidewalk for the road. "Too cold."<br><br>"I like it," she said. "The cold is very bracing, don't you think? Makes a body feel wide-awake."<br><br>The town's buildings, though unpainted, began to look a little better as they progressed. Smoke curled from twisted chimneys and doors were closed up tight.<br><br>There were few people on the streets, Clay noticed, though he glimpsed curious faces at various windows as they went by.<br><br>He raised his collar against the rising wind, figuring he'd had all the "bracing" he needed, thank you very much, and he was sure enough "wide-awake" now that he was off the train and back in the saddle.<br><br>He was hungry, too, and he wanted a bath and barbering.<br><br>And ten to twelve hours of sleep, lying prone instead of sitting upright in a hard seat.<br><br></p><h2>Skeleton Hill (A Detective Peter Diamond Mystery)</h2><p>On Lansdown Hill, near Bath, a battle between Roundheads and Cavaliers that took place over 350 years ago is annually reenacted.

Now Angus is missing, and it appears more than possible that Caleb--a creature long since abandoned to depravity--has murdered him.

Victorian detective William Monk returns, this time in one of the most challenging cases he's ever faced. Genevieve Stonefield begs Monk to find her missing husband, Angus, whom she fears has been killed by his twin brother, Caleb. Angus, a respected businessman, loyal husband and father, and pillar of the community, has disappeared after a visit to Caleb, who's as different from Angus as it's possible to be; he's a violent thief, ruffian, and blackguard who lives in one of London's most dangerous slums. Genevieve's fears that Angus is dead at Caleb's hand seem well founded; all Monk has to do is find the means, the motive, the opportunity--and the body. But the more he investigates, the more bizarre twists and frustrating dead ends he encounters, until his persistence finally breaks the case wide open in a stunning climax that surprises even the unflappable Monk. This one deserves high marks for superb plotting, fine writing, intriguing characters, and outstanding historical detail.

Readers lift flaps on different parts of the body to see what organs or muscles lie underneath.

The text is informative and so concise as to be more in the neighborhood of captions. The colorful illustrations are detailed and clear, and the flaps are not at all distracting.

Because The Constance Spry Cookbook is now an established classic and a timeless treasure which has stood the test of time and is the most requested cookery book on wedding gift lists we are producing for the first time in the book&#39;s history a deluxe slipcased edition with foil embossing on the cover and slip case and the book has color tipped pages. It is one of the kitchen bibles, worshipped by millions. Known for its authoritative and comprehensive collection of recipes, this is an essential addition to any kitchen and has become an invaluable source of information for every enthusiastic cook. Published in 1956, when both Constance Spry and Rosemary Hume were among the greatest names in cookery writing, it took three years to produce. Their aim was to offer a supremely practical book with chapters covering kitchen processes, soups and sauces, through vegetables, meat, poultry and game to cold dishes and pastry making. In fact everything every cook, or aspiring cook, would need to know. That the book has been so popular for over half a century is a true testament to how successfully they achieved their aim.</p><p>Rosemary Hume had opened her cooking school &#x2018;Ecole du Petit Cordon Bleu&#x2019; in London in the early 1930s having graduated from the Cordon Bleu Cookery School in Paris and in 1945 went on to become co-principal of the London school where she helped and encouraged many of the world&#x2019;s best cooks. She was a leading cookery writer of her day and was awarded an MBE before her death in 1984 at the age of 76.<br><br>Born in Derby but brought up and educated in Ireland, Constance Spry opened a small flower shop behind Victoria Station in London in the late 1920s and in the 30s this was followed by a school of flower arranging in Mayfair. Spry's outstanding skill and creativity made her much in demand at the highest social levels and her flower decorations became famous throughout the world; she was responsible for the flower arrangements at the wedding and coronation of the Queen. She became joint principal with Rosemary Hume of the Cordon Bleu Cookery School in London and later opened Winkfield Place, a residential school near Windsor, where young women could learn the complete art of cookery and entertaining. Before she died in 1960 Constance Spry had written twelve books on cookery and flower decoration."Cookery is vast, detailed, and lovely. The purpose of the book was to take the knowledge of culinary professionals and write it in a form that British housewives could understand and use. It was, and it remains, the British cookery [and cooking] bible."

She has written about style for the <i>New York Times Magazine</i> since 1994, and has contributed to various publications, including <i>The New Yorker</i>, <i>Harper's Bazaar</i>, <i>Vogue</i>, the <i>Washington Post</i>, and the <i>Financial Times</i> in London.

We're not just backstage at the runway show, we're all the way back in the factory, which might well be in a remote province of China. Dana Thomas is a fearless reporter who shows how so many designer goods have gone to hell in a handbag. This is a page-turning yarn about the men and women who have transformed luxury into an off-the-rack, global commodity. -- <i>Joel Achenbach, <i>Washington Post</i> columnist and author of <i>The Grand Idea </i></i><br><br>If you have ever wondered why a woman absolutely needs to buy a $3,000 handbag, or why she might perish without a certain shade of lipstick, this book explains it all in empirical, evolutionary detail. Dana Thomas has brilliantly dissected the fashion phenomenon while the healthy beast still thrives luxuriously on the operating table. Deluxe might make some women pause before spending the rent money on their Manolo Blahniks. -- <i>Richard Johnson, <i>New York Post </i></i><br><br>The story of luxury goods today is really about globalization, capitalization, class and culture. Dana Thomas has a feel for all of this and more and has written a fascinating book. A luxury product about luxury. -- <i>Fareed Zakaria</i><br><br>Through exhaustive reporting and personalized storytelling, Dana Thomas has delivered a historical survey of a business that truly keeps the world going round. She may never again be so readily welcomed in some quarters of this beau monde, but the trade off is an essential reference for any student of fashion, finance or culture. -- <i>Rose Apodaca, former west coast bureau chief, <i>Women's Wear Daily </i></i></p><h2>Be Responsible (1 Kings): Being Good Stewards of God&#39;s Gifts (The BE Series Commentary)</h2><p><p>&#x201c;A bad workman always blames his tools.&#x201d;<br> <br> The ancient proverb rings just as true today, and it is with this challenge for personal responsibility that Dr. Warren Wiersbe begins this latest installment of his comprehensive study through the Bible. Responsibility is not a popular concept for modern sensibilities that prefer to emphasize victimization and blame-seeking. Unfortunately, finding even leaders who will take it can be difficult, to say the least.<br> <br> King David knew what it meant to be a responsible leader, and so did his son Solomon . . . until the closing years of his reign. But out of the twenty subsequent kings who reigned in Judah, only eight could be called good kings and responsible men who sought to obey God.<br> Tragically, not only was there a lack of political moral leadership, but the spiritual leadership (priests and prophets) notoriously failed both God and the people.<br> <br> As you follow along with Dr. Wiersbe in this study of 1 Kings, you will see over and over again the importance of moral character in leaders, as well as the tragedy of leaving God out of national affairs. Clearly the call to Be Responsible is as much a need today as it was in the age of Judah&#x2019;s kings.<br> </p></p><p><b>Dr. Warren W.

Jimmy Miller, producer of some of the Rolling Stones' finest, recalls feeling pretty accomplished until he heard <i>Sgt.

Everywhere he goes however, the war follows him. Tracked down and locked up as a collaborator with the rural guerrillas, he embarks on a fast that angers, baffles, and finally awes his captors. The story of Michael K is the story of a man caught up in a war beyond his understanding, but determined to live his life, however minimally, on his own terms. J.M. Coetzee has produced a masterpiece which has the astonishing power to make the wilderness boom.In a south Africa turned by war, Michael K. sets out to take his ailing mother back to her rural home. On the way there she dies, leaving him alone in an anarchic world of brutal roving armies. Imprisoned, Michael is unable to bear confinement and escapes, determined to live with dignity. This life affirming novel goes to the center of human experience-the need for an interior, spiritual life; for some connections to the world in which we live; and for purity of vision.</p><h2>An Elephant in My Kitchen</h2><p>A blonde, chic Parisienne, Francoise never expected to find herself living on a South African game reserve. But when she fell in love with renowned conservationist Lawrence Anthony her life took an unexpected turn. Lawrence died in 2012 and Francoise was left to face the tough reality of running Thula Thula without him, even though she knew very little about conservation. She was short on money, poachers were capitalizing on the chaos of Lawrence&#x2019;s death, and one of their elephants was charging Land Rovers on game drives and terrifying guests. There was no time to mourn when Thula Thula&#x2019;s human and animal family were depending on her. How Francoise survived and Thula Thula thrived is beautifully described in this charming, funny and poignant book. Their elephant herd, rescued by Lawrence, shared Francoise's grief at his passing but over time forged a new relationship with her. One day a baby, Tom, became separated from the herd and found his way into Francoise's kitchen and there was a desperate race against time to save another baby who had a snare wrapped round his face and couldn't open his mouth to suckle. Meanwhile Francoise worked to create a rescue centre for orphaned rhinos. She also took on abandoned hippo baby Charlie who hated water and a German Shepherd called Duma who became an unlikely nursemaid, coach and best friend to all the traumatised rhino, hippo and elephant babies. If you loved Lawrence's The Elephant Whisperer, or just want to spend time with some remarkable animals, then you won&#x2019;t want to miss this sparkling book.</p><p><b>Francoise Malby-Anthony</b> founded the Thula Thula game reserve in 1998 with her late husband, the renowned conservationist and author Lawrence Anthony. When Lawrence died in 2012, Francoise took over the running of the reserve and is equally passionate about conservation. She was the driving force behind setting up a wildlife rehabilitation center at the reserve to care for orphaned animals. <b>Katja Willemsen </b>is a full-time writer and the author of the thriller <i>Shepherd's Prayer</i>.The most magical book about the African bush since Born Free. * Daily Mail *</p><h2>Last of the Amazons: A Novel</h2><p>The author of the international bestsellers <i>Gates of Fire</i> and <i>Tides of War</i> delivers his most gripping and imaginative novel of the ancient world&#x2013;a stunning epic of love and war that breathes life into the grand myth of the ferocious female warrior culture of the Amazons.<br><br>Steven Pressfield has gained a passionate worldwide following for his magnificent novels of ancient Greece, <i>Gates of Fire</i> and <i>Tides of War</i>. In <i>Last of the Amazons</i>, Pressfield has surpassed himself, re-creating a vanished world in a brilliant novel that will delight his loyal readers and bring legions more to his singular and powerful restoration of the past. <br><br>In the time before Homer, the legendary Theseus, King of Athens (an actual historical figure), set sail on a journey that brought him into the land of <i>tal Kyrte</i>, the &#x201c;free people,&#x201d; a nation of proud female warriors whom the Greeks called &#x201c;Amazons.&#x201d; The Amazons, bound to each other as lovers as well as fighters, distrusted the Greeks, with their boastful talk of &#x201c;civilization.&#x201d; So when the great war queen Antiope fell in love with Theseus and fled with the Greeks, the mighty Amazon nation rose up in rage. <br> <br><i>Last of the Amazons</i> is not merely a masterful tale of war and revenge. Pressfield has created a cast of extraordinarily vivid characters, from the unforgettable Selene, whose surrender to the Greeks does nothing to tame her; to her lover, Damon, an Athenian warrior who grows to cherish the wild Amazon ways; to the narrator, Bones, a young girl from a noble family who was nursed by Selene from birth and secretly taught the Amazon way; to the great Theseus, the tragic king; and to Antiope, the noble queen who betrayed <i>tal Kyrte</i> for the love of Theseus. <br><br>With astounding immediacy and extraordinary attention to military detail, Pressfield transports readers into the heat and terror of war. Equally impressive is his creation of the Amazon nation, its people, its rituals and myths, its greatness and savagery. <i>Last of the Amazons</i> is thrilling on every page, an epic tale of the clash between wildness and civilization, patriotism and love, man and woman.</p><p>With an epic scope and keen sense of detail, Steven Pressfield has created an entertaining and vital reimagining of the Amazon legend with his historical novel, <i>Last of the Amazons</i>. Combining myth with history, Pressfield offers a conjectural account of the legendary female warrior tribe as it may have existed in the years leading up to its extinction. Following the Athenian-Amazon war in the fifth century B.C., Amazon warrior Selene is taken captive and placed as an unlikely governess to the two daughters of a high-ranking Greek. The three form a lasting bond, and when Selene eventually escapes to return to Amazonia, eldest daughter Europa follows her. The Athenians, including King Theseus, assemble a group to find them, eventually traveling to Amazonia. Here, those involved relate the story of the Amazon war to the men, and the book's action really begins. Narrators tell of Theseus's earlier voyage to Amazonia, where his weakened crew was given shelter by the Amazons; the love affair between Theseus and Amazon queen Antiope; and the terrible consequences of the queen's defection and the Amazonian invasion of Athens that it inspired.<p> Throughout, Pressfield instills <i>Amazons</i> with a grandiose sensibility, firmly modeling it after the Homeric epics of its time. Pressfield relishes in describing these events and their heroes with a divinely consequential spirit:</p><p> </p><blockquote> Antiope advanced...Clearly no few of the foe took her for a goddess, with such splendor did her armor gleam and by such brilliance did her aspect exceed the common measure of humanity. The hour was still early, the west-facing slope deep in shadow, so that the Amazon, seen from the besiegers&#x2019; lines, advanced from gloom into flares of blinding dazzle. </blockquote> <p> Some clumsy dialogue and clich�d interactions hamper the book&#x2019;s emotional resonance, but the level of intricacy and constant action on display here keep the pages moving along. <i>Amazon</i> is ultimately an impressive, fun read that renders history spectacular in its speculation. <i>--Ross Doll</i></p>&#x201c;Writing historical fiction that transports you to another time and place is no easy feat, but in <i>Last of the Amazons</i>, Steven Pressfield does just that. He makes the distant past seem real and immediate. This is historical fiction elevated to the status of myth.&#x201d; <br>&#x2013;Daniel Silva, author of <i>The English Assassin<br></i></p><h2>God&#39;s Creative Power for Healing (God&#39;s Creative Power)</h2><p>This powerful book combines all new teaching with scripture confessions for healing.

Camping is now aluminum-covered, propane-heated, foam-padded, air-conditioned, bug-proofed, flip-topped, disposable, and transistorized. Hardship on a modern camping trip is blowing a fuse on your electric underwear, or having the battery peter out on your Porta-Shaver. A major catastrophe is spending your last coin on a recorded Nature Talk and then discovering the camp Comfort &amp; Sanitation Center (featuring forest green tile floors and hot showers) has pay toilets. There are many people around nowadays who seem to appreciate the fact that a family can go on an outing without being out. But I am not one of them. Personally, I miss the old-fashioned misery of old-fashioned camping. Young people just now starting out in campingprobably have no idea that it wasn't but a couple of decades ago that people went camping expecting to be miserable. Half the fun of camping in those days was looking forward to getting back home. When you did get back home you prolonged the enjoyment of your trip by telling all your friends how miserable you had been. The more you talked about the miseries of life in the woods, the more you wanted to get back out there and start suffering again. Camping was a fine and pleasant misery. A source of much misery in old-fashioned camping was the campfire, a primitive contrivance since replaced by gas stoves and propane heaters. It is a well-known fact that your run-of-the-mill imbecile can casually flick a soggy cigar butt out of a car window and burn down half a national forest. The campfire, on the other hand, was a perverse thing that you could never get started when you needed it most. If you had just fallen in an icy stream or were hopping around barefooted on frosted ground (uncommon now but routine then), you could not ignite the average campfire with a bushel of dry tinder and a blowtorch. The campfire was of two basic kinds: the Smudge and the Inferno. The Smudge was what you used when you were desperately in need of heat. By hovering over the Smudge the camper could usually manage to thaw the ice from his hands before being kippered to death. Even if the Smudge did burst into a decent blaze, there was no such thing as warming up gradually. One moment the ice on your pants would show slight signs of melting and the next the hair on your legs was going up in smoke. Many's the time I've seen a blue and shivering man hunched over a crackling blaze suddenly eject from his boots and pants with a loud yell and go bounding about in the snow, the fronthalf of him the color of boiled lobster, the back half still blue. The Inferno was what you always used for cooking. Experts on camp cooking claimed you were supposed to cook over something called "a bed of glowing coals." But what everyone cooked over was the Inferno. The "bed of glowing coals" was a fiction concocted by experts on camp cooking. Nevertheless the camp cook was frequently pictured, by artists who should have known better, as a tranquil man hunkered down by a bed of glowing coals, turning plump trout in the frying pan with the blade of his hunting knife. In reality the camp cook was a wildly distraught individual who charged through waves of heat and speared savagely with a long sharp stick at a burning hunk of meat he had tossed on the grill from a distance of twenty feet. The rollicking old fireside songs originated in the efforts of other campers to drown out the language of the cook and prevent it from reaching the ears of little children. Meat roasted over a campfire was either raw or extra well done, but the cook usually came out medium rare. The smoke from the campfire always blew directly in the eyes of the campers, regardless of wind direction. No one minded much, since it prevented you from seeing what you were eating. If a bite of food showed no signs of struggle, you considered this a reasonable indication that it came from the cook pot and was not something just passing through. Aluminum foil was not used much in those days, and potatoes were simply thrown naked into the glowing coals, which were assumed to lie somewhere at the base of the Inferno. After about an hour the spuds were raked out with a long stick. Most of the potatoes would be black and hard as rocks, and someof them would be rocks, but it didn't make much difference either way. Successive layers of charcoal would be cracked off until a white core of potato was uncovered, usually the size of a walnut or maybe a pea. This would be raw. Sometimes there would be no white core at all, and these potatoes were said to be "cooked through." Either that or they were rocks. There were other fine sources of camping misery besides campfires. One of the finest was the old-fashioned bedroll. No matter how well you tucked in the edges of the bedroll it always managed to spring a leak in the middle of the night. A wide assortment of crawly creatures, driven by a blast of cold air, would stream in through the leak. Efforts to close the gap merely opened new leaks, and finally you just gave up and lay there, passing the time until sunrise--approximately thirty-seven hours--by counting off insects one by one as they froze to death on your quivering flesh. My bedroll, made from one of my grandmother's patchwork quilts, was an oven compared to the first "sleeping bag" I ever spent a night in. My inconstant boyhood companion, "Stupe" Jones, told me one September day that I would not need my bedroll on our outing that night because he had discovered an honest-to-goodness sleeping bag in the attic of his house and it was big enough for both of us to sleep in. Now when I saw what a compact little package a real sleeping bag could be folded up into, I became immediately ashamed of my own cumbersome bedroll, which rolled up into a bundle the size of a bale of hay. I was glad that I had not marred the esthetics of our little camping trip by toting the gross thing along. That night we spread the sleeping bag out on a sandy beach alongside Sand Creek, stripped to our shorts (we had both been taught never to sleep with our clothes on), and hopped into the bag. The effect was much like plungingthrough thin ice into a lake. Not wishing to insult my friend or his sleeping bag, I stifled a shrill outcry with a long, deep gasp disguised in turn as a yawn. Stupe said through chattering teeth that the sleeping bag was bound to warm up, since it was, after all, a sleeping bag, wasn't it? No two lovers ever clung to each other with such tenacity as did those two eight-year-old boys through that interminable night. Later we discovered that some sleeping bags come in two parts, one a nice padded liner and the other a thin canvas cover. What we had was the latter. One of the finest misery-producing camping trips I've ever been on occurred when I was about fourteen. Three friends and I were hiking to a lake high up in the Idaho Rockies. What had been a poor, struggling drizzle when we left home worked its way up and became a highly successful blizzard in the mountains. Before long our climbing boots (called "tennis shoes" in more prosperous parts of the world) were caked with ice. The trail was slowly being erased before our very eyes, and I was beginning to write news stories in my head: "The futile search for four young campers lost in a snowstorm has been called off ... ." As we clawed our way up the side of the mountain, one of the frailer souls--never ask me who--suggested that the better part of valor or even of stark madness might be to turn back. But he was shouted down with such cries as, "When I come this far to fish, I am going to fish!" and "Who knows which way is <i>back?"</i> &nbsp; <br> &nbsp; <br> Eventually we came to the tiny cabin of a trapper, who had either been a midget or had crawled around on his knees all day, for the structure was only four feet from dirt floor to log ceiling. We tidied the place up by evicting a dead porcupine, split up enough wood to last amonth, and started a fire in a little makeshift stove. The stovepipe was a foot short of the roof and this resulted in the minor inconvenience of having the roof catch fire every once in a while, but nobody really minded. On the second day Kenny and I fought our way up to the lake, where he carried out his vow to fish, and then we stumbled back to the cabin. We stripped off our sopping clothes and sat down side by side on the woodpile next to the stove, whose glowing pipe was sending out soothing waves of heat from the flames howling up through it. Now as was our practice in those days, we had carried enough grub with us to feed a regiment of lumberjacks for a week of full-time eating, and Norm, a rather plump kid, decided to take the edge off his boredom by shooting "baskets" with an excess of hardboiled eggs he had discovered. The opening at the top of the stovepipe served as the "basket." Kenny and I watched in fascinated horror, as they say, as one of the rim shots lodged on the edge of the glowing pipe and the whole contraption began to topple toward our naked laps. Now both of us worked up a sizable amount of activity, but because of the cramped quarters, it was insufficient to move us clear of the descending pipe. In order to avoid incurrence of potentially worse damage to our anatomies we caught the stove pipe in our hands. For two or three hundredths of a second we passed the glowing cylinder back and forth between us, all the while calmly contemplating the best course of action, since neither one of us could manage to accumulate enough free time or leverage to get up from the woodpile. At last it occurred to us to simply drop the pipe on the floor, both of us wondering why we hadn't thought of such an obvious solution sooner. At the time it seemed that we had juggled the stovepipe for approximately two hours, but in retrospect, I doubt that the total time was more than half a second. Smoke, true to its nature, had in the meantime filled the cabin to overflowing and the four of us rolled out through the tiny door hole as a single choking ball of adolescent humanity. The storm outside, particularly to those not wearing any clothes, was refreshing and seemed to call for some strenuous exercise. What followed, as Vern remarked later, was something you don't see every day: two naked and enraged people chasing an hysterical fat kid up the side of a mountain in the middle of a blizzard. In terms of misery, that camping trip was very fine. I once launched my family on a program designed to toughen them up, on the assumption that the more misery they could endure the more they would enjoy hunting, fishing, and camping. Whenever anyone skinned a knee or thumped his "crazy bone," he was to reply in answer to inquiries about the extent of his pain: "A mere detail." Thus my children were expected to ignore the minor miseries encountered in the acquisition of outdoor knowledge and experience, and to make little of mosquito bites, burned fingers, and that vast assortment of natural projectiles known as "stickers." As it turned out, though, I had to abandon the program. One day on a family camping trip, I picked up a large branch for firewood and discovered an outlaw band of yellow jackets waiting in ambush. A running battle ensued. I finally outdistanced the little devils, as I called them, but not before several of them had inflicted some terrible wounds on various parts of my person. My family watched as I flitted like a nymph through the woods, careening off of boulders and leaping mammoth moss-covered logs. Fortunately, as my wife said later, most of my shouts were inaudible and the children were saved from traumas that might havewrought psychological havoc. When I finally lunged back into camp, still sweating and snarling, my littlest girl consoled me with the words, "Details, Daddy, mere details." Well I decided right then and there if a kid can't distinguish between <i>real</i> pain and a little old skinned knee, then I had better call off the whole program, and that is what I did. I mean you don't want your children to grow up to be totally insensitive. &nbsp; <br> &nbsp; <br> But camping misery is a thing of the past. Like most of my fellow outdoorsmen, having gathered unto the camper the fruits of technology, I am protected from cold by propane, from hardness by foam rubber, and from the insect world by a bug bomb. Still, sometimes I have a nostalgic yearning for some of that old-fashioned misery, and it came to me that what we need nowadays is a misery kit. I think it would find a market, especially among older campers, who might enjoy a bit of instant misery on a camping trip so they would have something to tell the folks back home about. There could be an aerosol can for spraying a blast of cold air down your back every once in a while, another for spraying smoke in your eyes. There might even be a pair of refrigerated boots that you could stick your feet into for a few minutes each morning. A rock or a pine cone could be included for slipping under the fitted sheet of a camper bunk. Everyone, of course, would want a pre-charred spud. There might even be a box of mixed insects--yellow jackets, mosquitoes, ticks, jiggers, and deer flies--but maybe that would be carrying misery a bit far.

Peter Coyle, the painter, was there, and Charlie Farmonger, and Evert Dax. A sort of vote had taken place, and I had emerged as the secretary. I was the oldest by a year, and as I was exempt from service I did nothing but read. Evert said, &#x201c;Oh, Freddie reads two books a day,&#x201d; which may have been true; I protested that my rate was slower if the books were in Italian, or Russian. That was my role, and I played it with the supercilious aplomb of a student actor. The whole purpose of the Club was getting well-known writers to come and speak to us, and read aloud from their latest work; we offered them a decent dinner, in those days a risky promise, and after dinner a panelled room packed full of keen young readers&#x2014;a provision we were rather more certain of. When the bombing began people wanted to know what the writers were thinking.<br><br>Now Charlie suggested Orwell, and one or two names we had failed to net last year did the rounds again. Might Stephen Spender come, or Rebecca West? Nancy Kent was already lined up, to talk to us about Spain. Evert in his impractical way mentioned Auden, who was in New York, and unlikely to return while the War was on. (&#x201c;Good riddance too,&#x201d; said Charlie.) It was Peter who said, surely knowing how Evert was hoping he wouldn&#x2019;t, &#x201c;Well, why don&#x2019;t we get Dax to ask Victor?&#x201d; The world knew Evert&#x2019;s father as A. V. Dax, but we claimed this vicarious intimacy.<br><br>Evert had already slipped away towards the window, and stood there peering into the quad. There was always some tension between him and Peter, who liked to provoke and even embarrass his friends. &#x201c;Oh, I&#x2019;m not sure about that,&#x201d; said Evert, over his shoulder. &#x201c;Things are rather difficult at present.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, so they are for everyone,&#x201d; said Charlie.<br><br>Evert politely agreed with this, though his parents remained in London, where a bomb had brought down the church at the end of their street a few nights before. He said, rather wildly, &#x201c;I just worry that no one would turn up.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, they&#x2019;d turn up, all right,&#x201d; said Charlie, with an odd smile.<br><br>Evert looked round, he appealed to me&#x2014;&#x201c;I mean, what do you make of it, the new one?&#x201d;<br><br>I had The Gift of Hermes face down on the arm of my chair, about halfway through, and though not exactly stuck I was already alternating it with something else. It was going to break my daily rhythm, and was indeed rather like tackling a book in a foreign language. Even on the wretched thin paper of the time it was a thick volume. I said, &#x201c;Well, I&#x2019;m a great admirer, as you know.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, well, me too,&#x201d; said Peter, after a moment, but more warmly; he was a true fan of A. V. Dax&#x2019;s large symbolic novels, admiring their painterly qualities, their peculiar atmospheres and colours, and their complex psychology. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m taking the new one slowly,&#x201d; he admitted, &#x201c;but of course, it&#x2019;s a great book.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Any jokes in it?&#x201d; said Charlie, with a hollow laugh.<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s never quite the point,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;with a Dax novel.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Anyway, haven&#x2019;t you read it?&#x201d; said Peter, going over to the window to see what Evert was looking at.<br><br>Poor Evert, as I knew, had never read more than the opening pages of any of his father&#x2019;s books. &#x201c;I just can&#x2019;t,&#x201d; he said again now, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know why&#x201d;&#x2014;and seeing Peter join him he turned back into the room with a regretful look.<br><br>After a moment Peter said, &#x201c;Good grief&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. did you see this, Dax?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. what&#x2019;s that&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?&#x201d; said Evert, and I was slow to tell the new confusion from the other.<br><br>&#x201c;Freddie, have you seen this man?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Who is it?&#x201d; I went across. &#x201c;Oh, the exhibitionist, I suppose you mean,&#x201d; I said.<br><br>&#x201c;No, he&#x2019;s gone&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; said Peter, still staring out. I stood at his shoulder and stared too. It was that brief time between sunset and the blackout when you could see into other people&#x2019;s rooms. Tall panes which had reflected the sky all day now glowed companionably here and there, and figures were revealed at work, or moving around behind the lit grid of the sashes. In the set directly opposite, old Sangster, the blind French don, was giving a tutorial to a young man so supine that he might have been asleep. And on the floor above, beneath the dark horizontal of the cornice and the broad pediment, a single window was alight, a lamp on the desk projecting a brilliant arc across the wall and ceiling.<br><br>&#x201c;I spotted him the other day,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;He must be one of the new men.&#x201d; Peter waited, with pretended patience; and Evert, frowning still, came back and looked out as well. Now a rhythmical shadow had started to leap and shrink across the distant ceiling.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, yes, him,&#x201d; Evert said, as the source of the shadow moved slowly into view, a figure in a gleaming singlet, steadily lifting and lowering a pair of hand-weights. He did so with concentration though with no apparent effort&#x2014;but of course it was hard to tell at this distance, from which he showed, in his square of light, as massive and abstracted, as if shaped from light himself. Peter put his hand on my arm.<br><br>&#x201c;My dear,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;I seem to have found my new model.&#x201d; At which Evert made a little gasp, and looked at him furiously for a second.<br><br>&#x201c;Well, you&#x2019;d better get a move on,&#x201d; I said, since these days new men left as quickly and unnoticed as they came.<br><br>&#x201c;Even you must admire that glorious head, like a Roman gladiator, Freddie,&#x201d; said Peter, &#x201c;and those powerful shoulders, do you see the blue veins standing in the upper arms?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not without my telescope,&#x201d; I said.<br><br>I went to fill the kettle from the tap on the landing and found Jill Darrow coming up the stairs; she was late for the meeting at which she might have liked to vote herself. I was very glad to see her, but the atmosphere, which had taken on a hint of deviancy, rather changed when she came into the room. She hadn&#x2019;t had the benefit of ten years in a boys&#x2019; boarding school, with all its ingrained depravities; I doubt she&#x2019;d ever seen a naked man. Charlie said, &#x201c;Ah, Darrow,&#x201d; and half stood up, then dropped back into his chair with an informality that might or might not have been flattering. &#x201c;We want Dax to ask his father,&#x201d; he said, as she removed her coat, and took in who was there. I set about making the tea.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, I see,&#x201d; said Jill. There was a natural uncertainty in Evert&#x2019;s presence as to what could be said about A. V. Dax.<br><br>At the window Evert himself seemed not to know she had come in. He and Peter stood staring up at the room opposite. Their backs were expressive, Peter smaller, hair thick and temperamental, in the patched tweed jacket which always gave off dim chemical odours of the studio; Evert neat and hesitant, a strictly raised boy in an unusually good suit who seemed to gaze at pleasure as at the far bank of a river. &#x201c;What are you two staring at?&#x201d; Jill said.<br><br>&#x201c;You mustn&#x2019;t look,&#x201d; said Peter, turning and grinning at her. At which she went straight to the window, myself close behind. The gladiator was still in view, though now with his back turned, and doing something with a piece of rope. I was almost relieved to see that the scouts had started their rounds. At one window, and then the next, a small black-coated figure appeared, reached up to close the shutters, and removed all sign of life. Across the way the scout came into Sangster&#x2019;s room, half-hidden by the oblong screen he carried through into the bedroom, and after a minute reappeared, edged round the two occupants, and kneeling on the window seat gazed out for a curious few seconds before pulling the tall shutters to. By dinner time the great stone buildings would be lightless as ruins.<br><br>&#x201c;Ah, Phil,&#x201d; said Charlie&#x2014;behind us my own scout had come in to do the same for us.<br><br>I said sternly, &#x201c;Do you know who this fellow is, Phil?&#x201d;<br><br>Phil had fought at the Battle of Loos, and after that earlier war had spent fifteen years in the Oxford police. He was affable and devoted to the College, but seemed sometimes to regret that he&#x2019;d ended up in an apron, dusting and washing dishes for young men he was powerless to discipline. &#x201c;What was it, sir?&#x201d; He propped his screen against the wall, and came over eagerly, as if I&#x2019;d spotted a miscreant. I noticed now that our own reflections were hanging very faintly between us and the view of other windows. I pointed upwards.<br><br>&#x201c;This&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ridiculous fellow,&#x201d; I said.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, him, sir,&#x201d; said Phil, a bit disappointed but trying for a moment to share our own interest in the luminous figure. &#x201c;I happen to know there was a bit of trouble there.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What sort of trouble?&#x201d; said Peter.<br><br>&#x201c;Well, the noise, sir. Dr. Sangster&#x2019;s been complaining about it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?&#x201d; said Evert. &#x201c;Noise&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Rhythmical creaking, apparently, sir,&#x201d; said Phil, with a grim look.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, goodness&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; said Evert.<br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s not one of ours, though, in fact,&#x201d; said Phil.<br><br>&#x201c;Ah,&#x201d; I said.<br><br>&#x201c;No, he&#x2019;s one of the Brasenose men,&#x201d; said Phil. In the vast gloomy College, its staircases half-deserted since the start of the War, new members of requisitioned colleges had been slipped in here and there, disoriented freshmen who found themselves also evacuees. Brasenose had been seized by a ministry of some kind, who according to my tutor were rather unsure what to do with it. &#x201c;If you could just excuse me, Mr. Green?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Of course, Phil.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t happen to know his name?&#x201d; said Jill.<br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s called Sparsholt, miss,&#x201d; said Phil, with a small cough as he swung the shutters to and dropped the iron bar safely in its slot.<br><br>&#x201c;Spar&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. sholt,&#x201d; said Peter, weighing the word and smiling slyly at Evert. &#x201c;Sounds like part of an engine, or a gun.&#x201d;<br><br>Phil looked at him blankly for a second or two. &#x201c;I dare say you&#x2019;re right, sir,&#x201d; he said, and went through into the bedroom. I set out my best Meissen cups, which I hoped might please Jill, and in the new closeness of the panelled and shuttered room we settled down to have tea.<br><br>jill stayed on, as my guest, for dinner in hall, and afterwards I went down to the gate with her. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll see you back,&#x201d; I said. She was at St. Hilda&#x2019;s, a fifteen-minute walk away, but in the blackout a bit more of a challenge.<br><br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s absolutely no need,&#x201d; she said.<br><br>&#x201c;No, no, take my arm&#x201d;&#x2014;which she did, touchingly enough. We set off&#x2014;I held the taped-over torch, which, with her elbow squeezed snugly against my side, we seemed to turn and point together. Even so, I sensed some reluctance in her. In a minute she freed herself to put on her gloves, and we went on like that past the tall railings of Merton, the great bulk of its chapel and tower sensed more than seen above us in the night. Jill glanced upwards. The darkness seemed to insinuate something between us, and though I think she was glad of my company it was awkwardly as though she had agreed to something. As I knew, it could be easier, once your eyes had adjusted, to walk without the startlements of the torch. Oddly, you moved with more confidence. All the same, we spoke nearly in whispers, as though we might be overheard. Often on those nights you did brush suddenly against other people passing or waiting entirely unseen.<br><br>Now the lane was a little black canyon, its gabled and chimneyed rim just visible to us against the deep charcoal of the sky. Clouds, in peacetime, carried and dispersed the colours of the lights below, but in the blackout an unmediated darkness reigned. I thought I knew this street I&#x2019;d walked along a hundred times, but memory seemed not quite to match the dim evidence of doorways, windows, railings that we passed. I asked Jill about her work, and she at once grew less self-conscious. She was reading History, but her interests were in archaeology, and in the remarkable things revealed by the London Blitz. She explained how bombs that knocked down City churches sometimes cut through the layers below, Tudor, medieval, Roman, exposing them in ways no organized human effort could have done. The human aspects of the devastation, the loss of life and home, clearly struck her rather less. She spoke excitedly about coins, coffins, bricks, fragments of pottery. I said it must be frustrating for her that Oxford itself had barely been damaged, and watched, if one can watch in the dark, her recognition, and disposal, of a joke. From the start she&#x2019;d been one of those who pass through student life with their eyes set firmly on the future: it was an urgent process, not a beautiful delay. Now the future for all of us had changed, the town pervaded by a mood of transience, and of near-readiness for action which it never saw. Did other friends share my feeling we might lose the War, and soon?&#x2014;defeatist talk was rare, and censored itself as it began. Jill had made her choice, for the army, but her mind was on the great things she would do once the War was won.<br><br>At the gate of St. Hilda&#x2019;s I stood half-illuminating our parting. &#x201c;Good night then,&#x201d; I said, with a humorous tremor.<br><br>Jill seemed to look over my shoulder. &#x201c;I wonder if Peter will paint that man.&#x201d;<br><br>I turned. &#x201c;Who&#x2019;s that?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The new man,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;Sparsholt.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, him.&#x201d; I laughed. &#x201c;Well, Peter generally gets what he wants.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A good subject, anyway, I&#x2019;d have thought,&#x201d; said Jill, and we shook hands. It wasn&#x2019;t what I&#x2019;d hoped for, and as I walked alone across the bridge, and then once more down Merton Lane, I worried at my own timidity and planned more confident advances when we met next time. I turned her face to mine, and found beauty in its symmetry. She had grey eyes, the strong chin of a Wagnerian soprano, and small white teeth. She gave off, close to, a tantalizing scent. For the moment, this would have to do.</p><h2>Secretariat: The Making Of A Champion</h2><p>Pages are clean and binding is tight.

And within the history of the scorecard are some of baseball's greatest moments. From the first scorecard introduced in 1845, to the scoring system devised by direct-marketing genius L. L. Bean; from presidential scoring habits to batting titles decided by official scorers to Phil Rizzuto's inspired scoring symbol "WW,* Dickson delights in his subject.

She's made peace with her past and overcome the negative behavior that resulted from her difficult childhood. Now she's back in the small town that was the closest thing to "home" she ever knew&#x2014;the town where she can be with the sister who's her only family.&nbsp;<br><br>There's just one catch. Aaron Amos still lives in Whiskey Creek, at least until he moves to Reno to open a branch of the Amos brothers' auto body shop. And no matter how hard she's tried, Presley hasn't been able to get over him. Seeing him again makes the longing so much worse. But she hopes she can get through the next few months, because she can't fall back into his arms...or his bed. She's come too far to backslide now. And there's a secret she's been guarding&#x2014;a secret she'll do anything to protect.</p><p>New York Times bestselling author Brenda Novak has written over 60 novels. An eight-time Rita nominee, she's won The National Reader's Choice, The Bookseller's Best and other awards. She runs Brenda Novak for the Cure, a charity that has raised more than $2.5 million for diabetes research (her youngest son has this disease). She considers herself lucky to be a mother of five and married to the love of her life.&nbsp;www.brendanovak.com <br>Aaron Amos was in the bookstore, too. Presley Christensen could tell by the prickle that skittered up her spine. Maybe she'd subconsciously recognized his voice amid the babble of the others, or there really was such a thing as a sixth sense, because when she turned and glanced across the crowded room, she confirmed what her body had already told her. He was standing off to one side, looking right at her.<br><br>It'd been two years since she'd seen him, and almost the same length of time since she'd shared his bed. But it felt like much longer. Her pregnancy and the first eighteen months of her son's life had been hard, harder than anything that had come before&#x2014;which was saying something for a girl who'd lived out of a car or a motel for most of her childhood.<br><br>Although she'd known when she decided to return to Whiskey Creek that she might bump into Aaron, and had tried to prepare herself for that moment, her eyes locked with his as if he held a high-powered magnet that drew them there against her will. Then it was all she could do not to stumble back; the sight of him hit her like a blow to the chest.<br><br><em>Damn it!</em> Her reaction&#x2014;the way her breath jammed in her throat and her stomach knotted&#x2014;was ridiculous. <em>Why</em> couldn't she get over him?<br><br>Gritting her teeth, she jerked her gaze away and slipped behind the people standing in line to get Ted Dixon's autograph. She was a big fan of Ted's work. Once she'd moved to Fresno to start over, his thrillers, along with a lot of other novels, had helped keep her mind occupied so she wouldn't fall back into her previous lifestyle. And after she found work at the Helping Hands Thrift Store, which was the best job she could land with so little education, books&#x2014;secondhand, mostly&#x2014;had provided the only entertainment she could afford. They'd especially been a blessing after Wyatt was born and she was up walking the floor so often with a colicky baby.<br><br>Still, Ted was local. It wasn't as if she wouldn't have another chance to see him. She'd wanted to come but probably wouldn't have if not for the urging of her sister. Cheyenne had insisted on watching Wyatt so Presley could get out for a few hours. She said it was important for her to take a break. And Presley was grateful. After the effort she'd put into cleaning her small rental house, getting settled and finding the perfect retail space to lease for her new yoga studio, she'd been eager for the chance to clean up and feel like something other than a mom.<br><br>But that was when she'd believed, as Cheyenne and Cheyenne's husband, Dylan, had believed, that Aaron would be a hundred and forty miles to the northeast. He planned to branch off on his own and open a franchise of Amos Auto Body, the collision repair shop he owned with Dylan and his other brothers. According to Cheyenne, he'd been spending a great deal of time in Reno looking for the best location.<br><br>"Excuse me." She pressed against the closest bookshelves in an attempt to squeeze past two men who were deep in conversation.<br><br>"Presley!"<br><br>She'd been so intent on her escape that she hadn't even looked up, but this caught her attention. Kyle and Riley, two of her sister's closest friends, were standing there. Ted Dixon, the author, belonged to their clique, so it was no surprise to see them here. If she searched hard enough, she'd likely find a handful of the others who'd hung out with Ted since kindergarten.<br><br>"Hello." She managed a smile, although her heart was pounding. Was Aaron, at this very instant, threading his way through the people standing between them?<br><br>There wasn't any reason he should feel uncomfortable approaching her. Maybe they hadn't kept in touch while she was gone, but there'd been no expectations along those lines. Their former relationship hadn't involved any commitment or obligation. They'd partied a great deal, and they'd had the hottest sex she'd ever experienced, but as far as <em>he</em> was concerned it was all in fun. They hadn't even had a fight when she left. The death of her mother and the knowledge of her pregnancy had set her off on a self-destructive odyssey that led her to an abortion clinic in Arizona. She'd felt sure that ending her pregnancy was what Aaron would want if he knew about it, which was why, when she decided to keep the baby, she didn't feel she owed him anything, even notice that Wyatt was his.<br><br>"Chey told me you were moving back," Kyle said. "How long have you been in town?"<br><br>She checked behind her, but at only five feet two inches tall she couldn't see over the people surrounding her&#x2014;and it was so packed she couldn't see through them, either. "Just a couple of weeks." She paused to be polite, but she wasn't about to hang out and talk for more than a quick second, not with Aaron ten feet away and possibly closing the distance between them. Unfortunately, she couldn't leave. Ted had already signed and personalized her book, and there was a huge line at the register.<br><br>Riley spoke before she could actually say the goodbye that hovered on her lips.<br><br>"It's great to have you home. You look <em>amazing,</em> by the way." He gave her a low whistle. "Must be all that yoga."<br><br>Presley felt too anxious to enjoy the compliment&#x2014;or to tell them that yoga had done a lot more for her than help her get into shape. That would prove to be too long a discussion. "Have you ever been to a class?" she asked instead.<br><br>Kyle and Riley exchanged a look. "Can't say I have," Riley drawled with a smile that told her he probably wouldn't, either.<br><br>"Once I get the studio open, you'll have to give it a try," she said.<br><br>"If you'll be there, <em>I'll</em> do it," Kyle volunteered.<br><br>Presley hadn't expected either of them to flirt with her. When she'd lived here before, she'd always had the feeling that they considered themselves too good for her. They'd been popular and well-adjusted from the beginning; she'd been a lost and lonely outcast who'd made some very poor choices. She might've been flattered at how her reception had changed, but she was too worried that she was about to be confronted by Aaron. She didn't want to speak to him. It made no difference how many times she told herself that he wasn't the right man for her, that their relationship had been unbalanced and unhealthy; she couldn't stop longing for his smile, his laugh, his touch.<br><br>Not that the difficulty of getting over him should have come as any surprise. Her whole life had been a series of struggles.<br><br>"Great. I should be open for business in another week." She <em>had</em> to open soon. She couldn't go without income for much longer. "See you there."<br><br>She could feel their eyes on her as she moved away, could tell they were startled she'd brushed them off. But with Aaron in the room...all she wanted to do was melt into the background. Just the sight of his perfectly sculpted face, which was almost <em>too</em> pretty despite the scar he'd gotten in a fight, was enough to drag her to a place of weakness and craving.<br><br>He was like the crack cocaine that'd taken control of her life before. She had to avoid him as avidly as all the other things that had nearly destroyed her.<br><br>It wasn't until she stepped through the curtain and into the dark storeroom where Angelica Hansen, owner of Turn the Page, received her inventory that Presley relaxed. She'd reached safety, a hidden corner where he'd be unlikely to look for her. Once Aaron left, she'd pay for her book and get out of there.<br><br>But when she turned, intending to peek out at those in the front of the store, she collided with his hard, unyielding chest as he came through the curtain.<br><br>He grabbed her before she could fall over the stack of books at her feet, drawing her up against him. "What are you doing back here?"<br><br>Breaking his hold before the smell or feel of him could erode her resolve, Presley stumbled, which sent the books flying. She was lucky they didn't trip her as they almost had before. "I...needed room to breathe. It's so...crowded out there. I thought I'd wait here for a few minutes, until the line was shorter."<br><br>His eyes narrowed slightly at the way she'd scrambled out of reach so quickly. Or maybe it was her reason for seeking the storeroom that gave him pause. Did he think she was trying to steal Ted's book?<br><br>Or had he figured out the truth? He'd always been perceptive&#x2014;too quick-witted for his own good...and hers. He was the sensitive Amos brother, the one who'd taken the loss of his mother and everything that'd happened after her suicide the hardest. But he didn't comment on the fact that she was still backing away.<br><br>"I heard you moved into the old Mullins place two weeks ago," he said.<br><br>She had to tilt her head to look into his face. "I did."<br><br>"Then...where have you been?"<br><br>Was he asking why she hadn't contacted him? "I've been busy."<br><br>"That means you're <em>never</em> home?"<br><br>Her stomach muscles tightened again. "You've dropped by?"<br><br>"I didn't bother to knock. I never see a car in the carport."<br><br>"I don't have a car anymore." She'd sold her new Hyundai several months ago so she could get out from under the payments and save enough to be able to lease a studio. She would've stayed in Fresno and kept saving to give herself a bigger financial cushion&#x2014;would've opened her studio there, too&#x2014;but when she found some strange marks on Wyatt, she was afraid his home day-care provider was mistreating him and decided to return to Whiskey Creek. Her sister had offered to help with child care, and once Aaron had told Cheyenne and Dylan he was relocating, going home was finally a possibility.<br><br>He hesitated. "How do you get around without a car?"<br><br>"For the most part, I walk." Chey's house was down the street and around the corner from hers. Her studio was two blocks in the other direction, along with the rest of downtown, making it easy to get wherever she needed to go.<br><br>"The exercise has obviously been good for you."<br><br>She wished that compliment didn't evoke the pleasure it did. But during the past two years, she'd judged everything by how much he'd like what she was doing, how she was changing herself. She supposed the desire to finally be admired by him was too powerful to overcome. "The owner of the thrift shop where I worked introduced me to yoga. That made the difference, more than anything else."<br><br>"Flexible <em>and</em> toned." His teeth flashed in an appreciative smile. "You look better than ever."<br><br>"Thanks." There were other things to explain the physical improvements&#x2014;like her strict eating habits&#x2014;but she didn't want to engage him in any more conversation than she already had. He wouldn't care what she was doing with her life&#x2014;not after he realized they weren't going to pick up where they'd left off and fall into bed.<br><br>"How have you been?" he asked. "It's been a long time."<br><br>And she'd felt every painstaking minute of it. She couldn't count how often she'd almost broken down and called him. Only the risk that he might find out he was Wyatt's father stopped her.<br><br>"Fine." She wiped sweaty palms on her jeans.<br><br>"You?"<br><br>"Hangin' in."<br><br>He seemed to be faring well. He'd put on a few pounds, nicely filling out his large frame, which he'd needed to do. He'd been muscular but too wiry that last year when they'd been seeing each other. According to Cheyenne and Dylan, he'd also quit using drugs. Now that she had the chance to see him, she believed it.<br><br>"Good," she said. "I&#x2014;I'm glad to hear it." She wished he'd leave it at that, but he didn't move out of the doorway, and she couldn't go anywhere while he was blocking her in.<br><br>"I was shocked to hear that you rented the Mullins cottage. That place was a cesspool when they lived there." He grimaced. "Talk about trashy people."<br><br>"It's taken some serious work to make it livable." She'd rented the two-bedroom because it was cheap and centrally located. Fortunately, where the house was concerned, a little elbow grease could make a big difference. "It's clean now. I just have a few things still to do."<br><br>"Like what?"<br><br>"Paint the porch and fix the fence. Plant some flowers out front."<br><br>He hooked his thumbs in his pockets. "Flowers?"<br><br>"Anything wrong with flowers?"<br><br>"Sounds like you're planning to stay for a while."<br><br>"I am."<br><br>"You weren't that domestic when you left."<br><br>She hadn't had a child then, but she didn't want to draw his attention to that, since he didn't know he was the one who'd made her a mother. "It's tough to be too focused on everyday concerns when all you care about is getting high."<br><br>"Yeah, I guess you're right." He rubbed his jaw. "I take it you've changed."<br><br>"Completely."<br><br>"I can see that."<br><br>No, he couldn't. Not yet. He assumed the changes were superficial, that she'd eventually fall at his feet the way she had before.<br><br>"I would've helped you clean up the rental," he said. "You should've called me."<br><br>She cleared her throat. "It wasn't necessary. I managed."<br><br>His eyes became guarded and inscrutable. He was figuring out that the "changes" he'd noticed included an unwillingness to associate with him. "Couldn't have been easy to get all that done, not with a baby."<br><br>Tentacles of fear slithered around her heart and squeezed. This was his first mention of Wyatt. She had to be careful, had to handle his perceptions carefully from the start. Any hint of suspicion on his part could destroy her happiness. "No, but I could've had Wyatt's father come and help. He would have, if I'd needed him."<br><br>"Doesn't he live in Arizona?"<br><br>Cheyenne had supplied everyone with this information, even Dylan. "He does, but he <em>could</em> come here. He has money, and he cares about Wyatt."<br><br>"You're in touch with him, then? He's a stand-up guy?" He sounded hopeful, as if he wanted that for her. There was no reason he wouldn't. To her knowledge, he'd never wished her ill, never done anything <em>purposely</em> to hurt her. He'd been too self-absorbed, but that was simply a byproduct of the fact that he'd never really cared about her, not like she'd cared about him.<br><br>"We don't have a relationship beyond Wyatt," she said, "but...he's a great father."<br><br>"That's got to make a big difference."<br><br>If Wyatt's father helped out to any significant degree, she wouldn't have had to clean the worst property in town in order to have a place to live but, thankfully, Aaron didn't seem to make the connection. "It does," she said. "And soon I'll be earning good money myself."<br><br>"As a yoga instructor, right?"<br><br>"And a massage therapist," she added so no one would be surprised when she advertised her services. She wanted everyone to understand from the beginning that she'd be doing both. She needed all the legitimacy she could establish.<br><br>"How'd you get into that?"</p><h2>Penguin English Library Wives and Daughters (The Penguin English Library)</h2><p>The Penguin English Library Edition of Wives and Daughters by Elizabeth Gaskell &#34;Eh, miss, but that be a rare young lady!

But in doing so, Molly risks ruining her reputation in the gossiping village of Hollingford - and jeopardizing everything with the man she is secretly in love with. The Penguin English Library - 100 editions of the best fiction in English, from the eighteenth century and the very first novels to the beginning of the First World War.</p><p>Set in English society before the 1832 Reform Bill, Wives and Daughters centres on the story of youthful Molly Gibson, brought up from childhood by her father. When he remarries, a new step-sister enters Molly&#39;s quiet life - loveable, but worldly and troubling, Cynthia. The narrative traces the development of the two girls into womanhood within the gossiping and watchful society of Hollingford. Wives and Daughters is far more than a nostalgic evocation of village life; it offers an ironic critique of mid-Victorian society. &#39;No nineteenth-century novel contains a more devastating rejection than this of the Victorian male assumption of moral authority&#39;, writes Pam Morris in her introduction to this new edition, in which she explores the novel&#39;s main themes - the role of women, Darwinism and the concept of Englishness - and its literary and social context.<b>Elizabeth Cleghorn Gaskell</b>&nbsp;was born in London in 1810, but she spent her formative years in Cheshire, Stratford-upon-Avon and the north of England. In 1832 she married the Reverend William Gaskell, who became well known as the minister of the Unitarian Chapel in Manchester&#x2019;s Cross Street. As well as leading a busy domestic life as minister&#x2019;s wife and mother of four daughters, she worked among the poor, traveled frequently and wrote.&nbsp;<i>Mary Barton</i>&nbsp;(1848) was her first success.Two years later she began writing for Dickens&#x2019;s magazine,&nbsp;<i>Household Words</i>, to which she contributed fiction for the next thirteen years, notably a further industrial novel,&nbsp;<i>North and South&nbsp;</i>(1855). <br><br>In 1850 she met and secured the friendship of Charlotte Bront�. After Charlotte&#x2019;s death in March 1855, Patrick Bront� chose his daughter&#x2019;s friend and fellow-novelist to write <i>The&nbsp;Life of Charlotte Bront�&nbsp;</i>(1857), a probing and sympathetic account, that has attained classic stature. Elizabeth Gaskell&#x2019;s position as a clergyman&#x2019;s wife and as a successful writer introduced her to a wide circle of friends, both from the professional world of Manchester and from the larger literary world. Her output was substantial and completely professional. Dickens discovered her resilient strength of character when trying to impose his views on her as editor of&nbsp;<i>Household Words</i>. She proved that she was not to be bullied, even by such a strong-willed man.<br><br>Her later works,<i>&nbsp;Sylvia&#x2019;s Lovers&nbsp;</i>(1863),&nbsp;<i>Cousin Phillis&nbsp;</i>(1864) and&nbsp;<i>Wives and Daughters</i>&nbsp;(1866) reveal that she was continuing to develop her writing in new literary directions. Elizabeth Gaskell died suddenly in November 1865.</p><h2>Time Salvager</h2><p>Time Salvager: a fast-paced time travel adventure from Wesley Chu, the award-winning author of <i>The Lives of Tao.</i><br><br>Convicted criminal James Griffin-Mars is no one's hero. In his time, Earth is a toxic, abandoned world and humans have fled into the outer solar system to survive, eking out a fragile, doomed existence among the other planets and their moons. Those responsible for delaying humanity's demise believe time travel holds the key, and they have identified James, troubled though he is, as one of a select and expendable few ideally suited for the most dangerous job in history.<br> &nbsp;<br> James is a chronman, undertaking missions into Earth's past to recover resources and treasure without altering the timeline. The laws governing use of time travel are absolute; break any one of them and, one way or another, your life is over. Most chronmen never reach old age; the stress of each jump through time, compounded by the risk to themselves and to the future, means that many chronmen rapidly reach their breaking point, and James Griffin-Mars is nearing his.<br> <br> On a final mission that is to secure his retirement, James meets Elise Kim, an intriguing scientist from a previous century, who is fated to die during the destruction of an oceanic rig. Against his training and his common sense, and in violation of the chronmen's highest law, James brings Elise back to the future with him, saving her life, but turning them both into fugitives. Remaining free means losing themselves in the wild and poisonous wastes of Earth, somehow finding allies, and perhaps discovering what hope may yet remain for humanity's home world.</p><p>WESLEY CHU is a finalist for the 2015 John W.

Detective-Adjutant Gripstra and Sergeant de Gier of the Amsterdam police are sent to investigate what looks like a simple suicide, but they are immediately suspicious of the circumstances.&nbsp; <br> &nbsp;<br> This now-classic novel, first published in 1975, introduces Janwillem van de Wetering&#x2019;s lovable Amsterdam cop duo of portly, worldly-wise Gripstra and handsome, contemplative de Gier. With its unvarnished depiction of the legacy of Dutch colonialism and the darker facets of Amsterdam&#x2019;s free drug culture, this excellent procedural asks the question of whether a murder may ever be justly committed.</p><p>Janwillem van de Wetering (1931&#x2013;2008) was born and raised in Rotterdam, but lived most recently in Surry, Maine. He served as a member of the Amsterdam Special Constabulary and was once a Zen Buddhist monk. He is renowned for his detective fiction, including <i>Outsider in Amsterdam</i>, <i>The Corpse on the Dike</i>, <i>The Japanese Corpse</i>, and eleven other books in the Grijpstra and de Gier series.Grijpstra dug in his wallet and after a while his square fat fingers found his police identification with its blue and red stripes and photograph of a much younger Grijpstra dressed in uniform with the silver button of his rank on both shoulders.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The dark man bent forward and read the card.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;H. F. Grijpstra,&#x201d; he read in a clear voice. &#x201c;Adjutant. Municipal Police of Amsterdam.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He paused.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I have seen it. Please come in.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Extraordinary,&#x201d; de Gier thought. &#x201c;Fascinating. That fellow actually read the card. It never happens. Grijpstra always shows his credit card and nobody ever notices anything. He could have shown a receipt from the electricity department and nobody would object, but this chap really reads the identification.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Who are you?&#x201d; Grijpstra was asking.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Jan Karel van Meteren,&#x201d; the man said.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They were in the corridor. There were three doors on the right, heavy oak doors. One of the doors was open and de Gier saw a bar and several young men with long hair and one elderly man with a bald head. Everybody was drinking beer. He had a glance of another young man behind the bar, dressed in a white T-shirt and decorated with a necklace of colored stones. Van Meteren was leading the way and they followed obediently. A staircase at the end of the corridor, again made of oak and recently polished. The floor of the corridor was covered with slabs of marble, cracked but very clean. Near the staircase Grijpstra noticed a niche with an upright Indian figure, made of bronze, life-size and with the right hand raised in a gesture of solemn greeting. Perhaps the gesture symbolized a blessing.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They climbed the staircase and came into a large open space with a high ceiling made of iron, painted white and with a relief of garlands picked out in gold. This was the restaurant, occupying the entire floor. De Gier counted ten tables, six seating four persons and four seating six persons. Nearly every chair was taken.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Grijpstra had stopped while their guide waited patiently. He was admiring a statue, standing on a stone platform attached to the wall. It was a statue of a female deity, performing a dance. The noble head on its slender neck seemed to contrast at first with the full breasts and the lewdly raised foot and Grijpstra was surprised that this naked sexual figure represented divinity and that he accepted her divinity. Undoubtedly the figure was free, quiet, detached and powerful. Superior. The thought flitted through his head. Superior. And free. Especially free. The thought disappeared as he walked on. De Gier had seen the statue but hadn&#x2019;t allowed himself to be interested. He watched the guests without fixing any one of them in particular. A fixed stare is aggressive and invites attention. He didn&#x2019;t want any attention and didn&#x2019;t get any. The guests took him for another guest and thought he wanted to join them. One man took his hat and briefcase off a chair and made an inviting gesture. De Gier smiled and shook his head. He noticed that nobody seemed to talk, perhaps they were listening to the music that came from several stereo loudspeakers and was hitting the room in waves. De Gier liked the music; it reminded him of a performance in the Tropical Museum. The heavy rhythmical cords would come from a bass guitar and the dry sharp knocks from a set of drums; he imagined that the wheezing high notes setting the melody itself would be a flute, a bamboo flute probably.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They were moving again, still following van Meteren. He led them through the restaurant and into a long narrow kitchen; through its windows there was a view of a garden full of red and pink rhododendrons. Two girls in jeans were busily stirring pots on a large stove. There was a sharp but not unpleasant smell of weird herbs. One of the girls wanted to object to the presence of strangers but stopped herself when she saw van Meteren.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was another narrow staircase and another corridor. White walls and several doors. They passed three doors and van Meteren opened the last, fourth, door.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; De Gier had a feeling that they had now penetrated into the secret part of the house; perhaps the silence of the corridor motivated the thought. The music of the restaurant didn&#x2019;t reach this lofty level. Grijpstra entered the room and sighed. He saw the corpse and it moved, exactly as he had expected. It would be the draft, of course, all phenomena can be explained, but the slow ghastly movement chilled his spine. De Gier had now come in as well and watched silently. He noticed the small bare feet with their neat toes, pointed at the floor. His gaze wandered upward and recorded the protruding tongue and the wide open bulging blue eyes. A small corpse that had belonged to a living man. A little over five feet. A thin man, well dressed in khaki trousers of good cloth, nicely ironed, and a freshly laundered striped shirt. Some forty years old. Long thick dark red hair and a full mustache, hanging down at the corners by its own weight. De Gier moved closer and looked at the corpse&#x2019;s wrist watch. He grunted. A very expensive watch, worth a small fortune. He couldn&#x2019;t remember ever having seen a gold strap of such width and such quality.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Both officers froze and quietly looked around, noticing as many details as possible. Almost automatically they had put their hands in their pockets. They had been trained in the same school. Hands in pockets cannot touch anything. This silent room was bound to be full of indications, traces, tracks.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They saw a large room, again with a high ceiling but not made of cast iron but of plain sawn planks supported by heavy deal beams. There were several bookcases, well filled. There was a telephone in one of the bookcases, and an expensive TV set and a new complete encyclopedia. The furniture consisted of a low settee, a table and three chairs. There were some cushions on the floor, embroidered. The patterns were unusual. Eastern designs probably, de Gier thought. There was a typewriter on the table with a letter in it. De Gier bent down.<br> <br>Dear Sirs:<br> I thank you for your letter of the tenth and have to inform you<br><br>No further text. The letterhead looked expensive. hindist society, the address and the telephone number.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They saw a footstool, lying on its side, near the feet of the corpse. They saw a gramophone, a stack of records and a low bed covered with a batik cloth. The woven curtains were closed but allowed enough light to filter through to see every detail of the room.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;What&#x2019;s that?&#x201d; Grijpstra asked, pointing at another low table, covered with red lacquer and serving as a seat for a fairly large statue, a rather fat bald-headed man sitting cross-legged and staring at them with glass eyes.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;An altar of sorts,&#x201d; de Gier answered after some thought. &#x201c;That copper bowl filled with sand must be an incense burner, and the brown spots in the sand are burnt-out incense sticks.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Grijpstra raised an eyebrow. &#x201c;You know a lot today.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I visit museums,&#x201d; de Gier said.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Grijpstra sniffed.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Incense?&#x201d; he asked.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; De Gier nodded. The heavy sweet smell gave him a headache.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Who discovered the body?&#x201d; de Gier asked van Met-eren, who was standing near the door.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I did,&#x201d; van Meteren answered. &#x201c;I had to ask Piet something and as he didn&#x2019;t answer when I knocked, I went back to my room. A little later I asked the girls in the kitchen if they had seen him and they said he had gone upstairs. I looked into the other rooms; one of them belongs to his mother, and another is the temple. He wasn&#x2019;t there. I thought he might be asleep and knocked again and then I opened the door and saw him hanging there. I telephoned the police and waited for you downstairs. Nobody knows anything yet.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Why didn&#x2019;t you cut the rope?&#x201d; asked de Gier.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;He was dead.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;How did you know?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Van Meteren didn&#x2019;t answer.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Are you a doctor?&#x201d; Grijpstra asked.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;No,&#x201d; van Meteren said, &#x201c;but I have seen a lot of corpses in my life. Piet is dead. Dead is dead. I could feel it. A dead body has no feel.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Did you touch it?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Van Meteren shrugged his shoulders. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have to feel a corpse to know it is dead.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...</p><h2>Symbolist Art (The World of Art series)</h2><p>Though the Symbolist heyday in Paris was short-lived, the movement had an influence on painting in both duration and geographical range. Important Symbolist painters were at work in places as remote from one another as Munch in Oslo, Klimt in Vienna, and the young Picasso in Barcelona. It is through Symbolism, too, that the relationship between the English painting of the later nineteenth century and what was taking place in Europe can be explained. Edward Lucie-Smith&#39;s important study throws light upon the origins of Modernism, and upon the development of painting and sculpture in the final years of the century. 185 illus., 24 in color.</p><p></p><h2>Christmas on Candy Cane Lane (Life in Icicle Falls, 8)</h2><p>www.SheilasPlace.com<br><br><b>Icicle Falls is the place to be at Christmas...&nbsp;</b><br><br>Everyone's getting ready for Christmas in Icicle Falls, especially on Candy Cane Lane, where holiday decorating is taken very seriously.

Just what nobody wanted on the day before Thanksgiving.<br><br>"Not if we get to her in time," said her partner, Jamal Lincoln.<br><br>"Why us?" Tilda grumbled to Cherie, the dispatcher. "This is a job for animal control."<br><br>"Chief said you'd say that," Cherie told her. "He also said to tell you that today it's a job for you and to bring a rope and get to work before somebody ends up hurt."<br><br>"I don't believe this," Tilda muttered as Jamal turned on the look-out-here-come-the-cops lights and shot their patrol car out of town toward the highway.<br><br>"We're in Icicle Falls. Believe it," Jamal said. "You still got that rope in the trunk?"<br><br>"Yes. It's there from the last time." Tilda frowned. "You know, this really isn't the job of the Icicle Falls Police Force. I don't care if Stumpy Hodgkins is best buds with the chief."<br><br>"You gonna tell that to the chief?"<br><br>"Yeah, I am. As soon as we get back to the station."<br><br>Jamal grinned. "That's what I love about you, partner. You're fearless. You should've been a man. I swear you've got more balls than most guys."<br><br>"Thanks. I think."<br><br>Tilda knew she was a tough cookie, and she liked being tough. She liked being a modern woman, able to stand up for herself and hold her own against any man. But she also had a feminine side and, secretly, she fantasized about some man tougher than her, pushing her up against a wall and having at it.<br><br>She'd thought she'd found that man, but it hadn't worked out. He'd never bothered to look beneath her tough exterior and check out her sweet, soft side. Instead, he'd fallen for the kind of woman Tilda thought of as a cream puff. Maybe that was what all men really wanted, someone as sweet as honey and as elastic and bendable as warm taffy. Tilda wasn't a bending kind of woman. Sadly, there were very few men who appreciated that.<br><br>Jamal did, but he was her partner. Then there was Devon Black, town bad boy, the king of speeding tickets and barroom brawls, who thought he was God's gift to women. In fact, he thought he was God's gift to <em>her.</em> Christmas might have been just a month away, but she had no intention of unwrapping Devon Black.<br><br>She frowned, thinking of their last encounter. "What the hell?" he'd said angrily when she'd pulled him over a week ago for a broken taillight. "I wasn't speeding."<br><br>"No, you have a taillight out."<br><br>Instead of showing some respect and thanking her for letting him know, he'd flashed her a cocky grin and said, "You're looking for excuses to see me." As if she had nothing better to do than chase after wolves dressed in blue jeans.<br><br>"If I wanted to see you, I could just wait till the next bar fight," she retorted. It was how she'd met him when he moved to town. Trouble followed Devon around like a lost puppy. "Now, do you want me to let you off with a warning or do you want to keep flapping that big mouth of yours and up the ante?"<br><br>That had shut him up&#x2014;until she gave him his warning and turned to leave. "I'm working the bar at the Man Cave. Come on by after you get off work and I'll give you a beer on the house." As if he owned the place. It was his brother's. He just filled in on weekends.<br><br>"In your dreams," she'd called back over her shoulder.<br><br>"And yours, too, I'll bet. I can show you some new uses for those handcuffs."<br><br>"Oh, there's an original line," she'd muttered. <em>Fifty Shades of Devon Black.</em> No way, even if he <em>was</em> ridiculously gorgeous. So was a hot-fudge sundae, but look what it did to your butt.<br><br>"There's Stumpy," Jamal said, bringing her back to the present.<br><br>Sure enough, the short, old guy was hobbling as fast as he could down the side of the snowbanked road in his jeans and cowboy boots and leather bomber jacket, his hunting cap mashed down over his ears, a lasso dangling from his right hand and Daisy's halter from his left. And there, half a mile farther up the road, trotted his horse, the escape artist. Loose again. Not a good thing, considering the fact that the old paint was deaf.<br><br>"You can turn off the lights now," Tilda said, and Jamal obliged.<br><br>They pulled up beside Stumpy and Tilda lowered the window. "Stumpy, this is the third time this month she's gotten loose."<br><br>"I know, and I'm sorry. Daisy!" he hollered at the horse. "Dang it all, come back."<br><br>Sometimes Tilda wondered how deaf Daisy really was. Either she was faking it or she was psychic because the darned beast tossed her head as though she was saying, "No way." Then she started across the road. Oh, great.<br><br>An SUV came over the rise and Tilda sucked in her breath. The car skidded to a halt and waited while Daisy stood in the middle of the road, trying to decide what to do. The driver soon tired of waiting and honked. The noise didn't faze Daisy. She stood there, watching Tilda, Jamal and Stumpy as if wondering what they were doing out here on a cold winter afternoon. Then she strolled back to her own side of the road and continued her journey, probably looking for some other horses to spend Thanksgiving with.<br><br>"Give me the rope and get in," Tilda commanded. With Stumpy safe inside and the rope in hand, they set off in hot pursuit. Well, semihot, not wanting to end up hitting the animal.<br><br>"I'd'a gotten her," Stumpy insisted from the backseat. "I don't know why Mildred keeps calling you guys."<br><br>"Because she's seen the way you drive," Tilda said. They were lucky that Stumpy hadn't taken the horse trailer. The week before, he'd attempted to rope Daisy from behind the wheel, skidding into Dan Masters's truck and effectively blocking traffic for a good forty minutes while they sorted things out. Daisy, naturally, had gotten away and wound up at the llama farm.<br><br>They'd almost reached the horse. "Stop here," Tilda told Jamal. "We don't want to spook her."<br><br>"Everything spooks her," Stumpy grumbled.<br><br>The natural retort would be, "Then why do you keep the dumb critter?" But Tilda didn't say it. She knew why. Daisy had been their granddaughter Willow's horse. Willow had died two years earlier from a brain tumor. Stumpy could no more get rid of the horse than he could throw out the pictures of their only granddaughter that filled their living room.<br><br>Tilda got out of the car and shut the door as Daisy moved down the road a few paces.<br><br>"Go get 'er, cowgirl," Jamal teased.<br><br>"Ha, ha," Tilda muttered. Jamal was the size of Texas and could take down three men single-handed, but he was a city boy and no use whatsoever in capturing a deaf horse.<br><br>Tilda moved away from the patrol car. Daisy, sensing pursuit, trotted a few more feet, then stopped and looked around. <em>Neener, neener, neener. You can't catch me.</em><br><br><em>Oh, yes, I can. You may be big, but you've got a brain the size of an onion.</em> Tilda squatted next to the freshly piled snow on the side of the road and waited. She'd done her share of ropin' and ridin'. Gone to horse camp at the nearby guest ranch all through high school. She was not going to be outsmarted by a horse.<br><br>Daisy tossed her mane and then, to show that she wasn't even remotely worried about Tilda and her rope, decided to enjoy a little roadside snack, pulling up a mouthful of snow-tipped grass.<br><br>Tilda slowly stood and sneaked forward a few feet.<br><br>Daisy raised her head and Tilda froze. This was like playing Red Light, Green Light when she was a kid. Daisy went back for seconds. Okay, green light. Tilda moved forward again.<br><br>Daisy lifted her head and checked to see where Tilda was.<br><br>Frozen in place, of course.<br><br>The next time the horse went for some grass, Tilda moved in, and this time when Daisy lifted her head, Tilda swung the rope and...missed.<br><br>Daisy shied away and trotted off down the road, and Tilda swore.<br><br>"You rope about as good as you shoot," Jamal called from the patrol car.<br><br>Tilda gave him the finger and started the whole process again. Horses were such foodies. Tilda could have lured over any other equine simply by shaking a can of oats. Was there such a thing as horse hearing aids? If so, it would sure make catching Daisy a lot easier.<br><br>It took two more tries before she got the rope around Daisy's neck, although the third try wasn't exactly the charm. Daisy neighed and pulled away, and even though Tilda had planted her feet, the horse still managed to yank her over into the snow. "Oh, no, you don't," Tilda growled, struggling back to her feet. "Bring the halter," she yelled.<br><br>Stumpy climbed out, holding it. "We got her now," he said gleefully.<br><br><em>We. Yeah, right.</em><br><br>Finally Daisy was haltered and rewarded for cooperating with the police with a pat on the neck. "You'd better stop this escape-artist stuff or we're gonna ship you off to become dog food," Tilda threatened.<br><br>Daisy just tossed her head yet again. She knew Tilda was all talk and no action.<br><br>Tilda was equally stern with Stumpy. "You make sure your fence is well mended and you keep that barn door shut," she told him as she handed over the escapee. "We can't keep coming out to help you catch her." She felt bad about being mean to the old guy. He was in his seventies and had arthritis in both hips, and maintaining the house and barn on their five-acre spread was getting to be too much for him. His wife was ready to downsize. Maybe being in trouble with the cops would motivate Stumpy to find a home for Daisy and move someplace smaller.<br><br>Stumpy hung his head. "I know, Tilda. You guys have better things to do."<br><br>"In Icicle Falls?" Jamal cracked as they drove off, leaving Stumpy and Daisy to make their own way home.<br><br>"Right."<br><br>"Hey, you want action? Go to New York or LA," Tilda said, and turned up the heat. They'd have to swing by her place so she could get some dry pants.<br><br>"No, thanks," he said with a grin. "No horses to chase in LA. Anyway, I'd probably get stuck riding with some clown who farts all the time. Besides, where am I gonna find a lady cop as cool as you?"<br><br>That made her smile. "If you're trying to flatter me..."<br><br>He snorted. "Like that would get me anywhere." He shook his head. "It sucks when the best woman in town also happens to be your partner."<br><br>"Okay, now it's getting really thick in here." She had a pretty good face and her body was in mint condition but, sadly, there were too many good-looking women and not enough men in this town. She glanced out the window at the snowy firs and pines. "Sometimes I think I should've moved to Seattle." Except that Icicle Falls was her home and her roots ran too deep. Hmm. Maybe she was root-bound.<br><br>Jamal grunted. "You should've thought of that before you bought a house. Hey, we still on for Saturday?"<br><br>"Yep. When are you coming back from your mom's?"<br><br>"Friday morning."<br><br>"Good. You can help me finish packing."<br><br>"You know, some of us have to fill in for you and work that day. Who takes vacation on Thanksgiving weekend, anyway?"<br><br>Somebody who had a lot of vacation days piled up and more seniority than half the guys on the force. Tilda grinned at him and played the world's smallest violin on her fingers.<br><br>"All I gotta say is you better feed me."<br><br>"'Cause you're a growing boy?"<br><br>"Order something from the deli. I don't wanna get poisoned," he joked. "Where'd you not learn to cook?"<br><br>"From my mom."<br><br>"Come on, your mom owns Pancake Haus. She can't be that bad a cook."<br><br>"She hires people to do stuff in the kitchen, you dope." Tilda sighed. "The turkey will probably be dry and we'll have stuffing out of a box. But I like stuffing out of a box. And Mom's great with pickles and olives. And at least Aunt Joyce and the cousins will be bringing the candied yams and casseroles."<br><br>"What are you bringing?"<br><br>"Pumpkin pie."<br><br>"From?"<br><br>"What do you mean 'from'?"<br><br>"I know you ain't bakin' it."<br><br>Busted. Tilda shrugged. "Gingerbread Haus."<br><br>"Yep, you're gonna make some lucky guy a great husband someday."<br><br>"Oh, ha, ha."<br><br>He shook his head. "Somehow, I just can't picture you in a house."<br><br>"What should I be living in, a yurt?"<br><br>"More like an army barracks."<br><br>"I do have a feminine side, you know."<br><br>"Sure you do."<br><br>She did, and she could hardly wait to get everything all squared away in her new house on Candy Cane Lane. She'd have dried flowers on the dining table and she was going to give that quilted wall hanging her cousin Georgie had made for her a place of honor on the living room wall. The house had three bedrooms, two baths, a big living room with a fireplace and a den, which she was going to turn into a kick-ass party room where her pals from the force could come over and play Call of Duty and World of Warcraft. The kitchen was bigger than the one she'd had in her condo. Once she put in new flooring, it would be great. Lots of room to...heat frozen dinners. Or make cookies. She made a mean chocolate chip cookie. Maybe, with her fancy new kitchen, she'd graduate to cake or pie or something.<br><br>Expanding her cooking skills would have to wait, though. The house needed some serious work. It had been a bank repo and the previous owners had done a fair amount of damage. Walls would have to be repainted, gutters replaced and, of course, the kitchen set to rights. And she'd have to replace the carpeting, which was badly stained and a little on the smelly side. Well, okay, a lot.<br><br>She hoped she could afford to give herself new carpeting for Christmas, at least in the living room and den.<br><br>"I don't know, Tillie girl," her mom had said when they'd first gone to see the place. "Sure looks like a lot of work. You really want to mess with that?"<br><br>"Yes," Tilda had replied. "It's in a great neighborhood. It'll be a good investment."<br><br>"It'll be a pain in the patootie," Mom had corrected her.<br><br>Yeah, but it would be <em>her</em> pain in the patootie and she was ready for it. For the past five years she'd been envisioning herself in a house with a great guy and a couple of kids and a big, friendly dog. The guy thing hadn't happened and she'd decided there was no point in waiting around. She was going to get her house and the dog, too. Heck, maybe even a kid. These days you didn't need a man to have kids. These days, it seemed you didn't need a man for much of anything.<br><br>Tilda wanted one, anyway. There were still some things nobody did better than men, and she was darned tired of being the only one who ever saw the lacy bras and matching thongs she wore under her uniform.<br><br>A man with a handsome, swarthy face and an admirable set of pecs suddenly appeared at the back of her mind. Oh, no. Devon Black was not in the running for that cozy life with the house, the kids and the dog. Devon Black did <em>not</em> deserve to see her in her bra and panties. Or out of them.<br><br>Someday she'd find the right man. New people moved to Icicle Falls all the time. Maybe Santa would bring her the perfect man for Christmas next year. This year it was a house. And that was enough to ask for. After all, there was only so much the jolly old guy in red could fit in his sack.</p><h2>Trust</h2><p><p>A novel of corruption, deceit, and dishonor, <i>Trust</i> opens in small-town America in the long hot summer of 1967.

Tour.</p><p>Harry Crews&nbsp;is the author of twenty books and numerous articles and columns. He lives and works in Florida.The latest novel by this former master of true grit southern fiction smartly steers away from the slapstick antics that so marred his last (Body, 1990). Even so, Crews still can't re-create the redneck eloquence of his early work. All the losers and weirdos who people this off-kilter book bear some kind of scar, literal or metaphoric. Pete Butcher, boxcar worker and former Marine, carries the heaviest burden--three years earlier he accidentally slammed his four-year-old brother in the forehead with a hammer, turning the bright and affectionate boy into a slobbering vegetable. Shortly thereafter, his parents die in a flaming car wreck, his brother is institutionalized, and the rest of Pete's family rejects him. This Georgia boy quits the University of Florida after four days and finds himself busting his hump in Jacksonville, trying to forget the past. Only no one will let him. Not his co-worker George, a bulking Rastafarian from Jamaica whose back is branded annually by his woman, Linga, a voodoo goddess with an elaborate design of scars on her beautiful mulatto face. When the family across the street from Pete's boardinghouse learns his story from a busybody neighbor, they too join the effort to redeem Pete, who feels ``cursed before man and God.'' The Leemers themselves are also part of the ``walking wounded''--mother Gertrude has just had a radical mastectomy; father Henry is a hard- working, overly cautious fellow; and daughter Sarah, who captures Pete's heart, fears the lump in her breast may be a legacy from her mother. After Henry dies from a heart attack, things take a turn for the bizarre, sucking Pete into a wild plot of corpse-snatching, cremation, and Rasta hocus-pocus. Only the strong and patient Sarah (``a woman to be reckoned with'') can pull Pete from this ``quagmire of craziness,'' and also reunite his family. A roomful of farting corpses indicates the depths to which Crews sinks here for comic relief. From sin to redemption, this highly improbable tale of hope and affirmation just doesn't cut it- -it's as belabored as the awkward title. -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

But few people know what a complicated figure he was--or the dramatic story behind <i>The Birds of America</i>.<br><br>Before Audubon, ornithological illustrations depicted scaled-down birds perched in static poses. Wheeling beneath storm-wracked skies or ripping flesh from freshly killed prey, Audubon's life-size birds looked as if they might fly screeching off the page. The wildness in the images matched the untamed spirit in Audubon--a self-taught painter and self-anointed aristocrat who, with his buckskins and long hair, wanted to be seen as both a hardened frontiersman and a cultured man of science.<br> <br>In truth, neither his friends nor his detractors ever knew exactly who Audubon was or where he came from. Tormented by a fog of ambiguities surrounding his birth, he reinvented himself ceaselessly, creating a life as dramatic as his fictionalizations of it. But when he came east at thirty-eight--broke and desperate to find a publisher for his <i>Birds</i>--he ran squarely into a scientific establishment still wedded to convention and suspicious of the brash newcomer and his grandiose claims. <br><br>It took Audubon fifteen years to prevail in both his project and his vision. How he triumphed and what drove him is the subject of this gripping narrative.<br></p><p><b>William Souder</b> is the author of<i> A Plague of Frogs</i> and a frequent science contributor to <i>The Washington Post</i> and other publications. He lives near Minneapolis.<br>Renowned for his knowledge of the American wilderness, John James Audubon (1785&#x2013;1851) was equally adept at the quintessential American activity of self-invention. Arriving in New York City in 1803, the 18-year-old native of Saint-Domingue (now Haiti) and illegitimate son of a French sea captain passed himself off as the Louisiana-born scion of a French admiral and claimed to have studied painting with the European master Jacques-Louis David. Audubon (even the name was false) came to the United States to manage a small estate his father co-owned near Philadelphia. Unsuccessful, he eventually tried his hand as a shopkeeper and a mill owner, but failed there, too. His passion for hunting&#x2014;and for making life-size, realistically posed paintings of the animals he shot&#x2014;led to the creation of his magnum opus, <i>Birds of America</i>, now one of the most admired works of American art. But this monumental venture was fraught with difficulties that sometimes brought the artist near the brink of despair. Audubon's work was initially scorned in the U.S.; he had to travel through Britain and France to arouse enough interest to fund the project. Even after its completion and its enthusiastic reception in Europe and the U.S., the work left the naturalist with only a modest income for a lifetime of effort. Souder (<i>A Plague of Frogs</i>) presents Audubon as a complex individual: a loving but distracted husband; a driven artist often plagued by doubts; a scrupulous observer of nature who thought nothing of fabricating some of his written material for dramatic effect. Sympathetic yet balanced, this account shows how much Audubon was shaped by the deep paradoxes of the time and place in which he lived.

Goodwin began his career as a law clerk to Supreme Court Associate Justice Felix Frankfurter and as special counsel to the congressional subcommittee investigating the quiz-show scandals. During the Kennedy administration, Goodwin served as deputy assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs and as secretary-general of the Peace Corps. In 1964, he became a special assistant to President Lyndon B. Johnson, for whom he wrote the landmark &#x201c;We Shall Overcome&#x201d; speech in support of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and also originated&nbsp;the Great Society programs. After leaving government service, Goodwin taught at Wesleyan University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The author of several books, including&nbsp;<i>Promises to Keep&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>Remembering America</i>, he lives in Concord, Massachusetts, with his wife, Doris Kearns Goodwin.&nbsp;Billed as a sweeping personal retrospective of the 1960s, and coming with high praise from luminaries, this is essentially a speechwriter's memoir that functions best as high-level insider's gossip. As assistant special counsel to John Kennedy, Goodwin was privy to the planning of the Bay of Pigs invasion against Castro and other matters. Yet he admits unblushingly that he knew almost nothing about the internal politics of Vietnam as late as January 1965. There are behind-the-scenes glimpses of Governor Wallace of Alabama and Che Guevara. Becoming Lyndon Johnson's chief speechwriter, Goodwin found LBJ to be a "gargantuan manipulator" but defends his politics ("The Great Society did not fail. It was abandoned"). His portrayal of Johnson as paranoid and out of touch with reality is certainly alarming. This self-congratulatory, rhetorically high-flown memoir also includes close-ups of Robert Kennedy and of Goodwin's role in Eugene McCarthy's bid for the presidency. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Marx Bros.

Stuart Hall's story is the story of an age' Owen Jones</b> </p><p><i>'Sometimes I feel I was the last colonial'</i><br><i></i><br><i></i>This is the story, in his own words, of the extraordinary life of Stuart Hall: writer, thinker and one of the leading intellectual lights of his age. Growing up in a middle-class family in 1930s Jamaica, then still a British colony, Hall found himself caught between two worlds: the stiflingly respectable middle class in Kingston, who, in their habits and ambitions, measured themselves against the white planter elite; and working-class and peasant Jamaica, neglected and grindingly poor, though rich in culture, music and history. But as colonial rule was challenged, things began to change in Jamaica and across the world.</p><p>When, in 1951, a scholarship took him across the Atlantic to Oxford University, Hall encountered other Caribbean writers and thinkers, from Sam Selvon and George Lamming to V. S. Naipaul. He also forged friendships with the likes of Raymond Williams and E. P. Thompson, with whom he worked in the formidable political movement, the New Left, and developed his groundbreaking ideas on cultural theory. Familiar Stranger takes us to the heart of Hall's struggle in post-war England: that of building a home and a life in a country where, rapidly, radically, the social landscape was transforming, and urgent new questions of race, class and identity were coming to light.</p><p>Told with passion and wisdom, this is a story of how the forces of history shape who we are.</p></p><p></p><h2>Don&#39;t Just Sit There</h2><p>If sitting is indeed the new smoking, then certainly we should quit.

Full of eloquence, epic grandeur, and myth, his haunting, rhapsodic poems still cast their lyrical spell today.<br></p><p><p>Alfred, Lord Tennyson was born in 1809 at Somersby, Lincolnshire. Schooled at Louth and by his father, a rector, he began to write early, and at the age of twelve he composed &#x201c;an epic of 6,000 lines.&#x201d; In 1828 he matriculated at Cambridge&#x2014;but only after the elder Tennyson had approved his recitation by heart of the odes of Horace. <b>Poems, Chiefly Lyrical</b>, published in 1830, revealed Tennyson&#x2019;s swiftly maturing talent, a talent which was augmented by his friendship with Edward FitzGerald and A.H. Hallam. In 1830, the poet and Hallam volunteered in the army of a Spanish insurgent; and <b>Poems</b> (1833) derived largely from experience gained on the Continent. Hallam&#x2019;s death in the same year gave rise to <b>The Two Voices</b> (1834)&#x2014;a black period in Tennyson&#x2019;s life. After a lengthy silence he published <b>Poems</b> (1842), earning the admiration of Carlyle and Dickens. The year 1850 witnessed his marriage to Emily Sarah Sellwood and his appointment as poet laureate, succeeding Wordsworth. The gravity with which he took his office was reflected in many poems on state occasions. His later years produced his acknowledged masterpieces: <b>In Memoriam</b> (1850), <b>Maud</b> (1855), <b>Ballads and Other Poems</b> (1880), <b>Locksley Hall Sixty Years After</b> (1886), and scattered sections of what would eventually become his epic, <b>Idylls of the King</b> (1859-1885). In 1892, reading his favorite Shakespeare, Tennyson died at Aldworth and received a public funeral in Westminster Abbey.</p></p><h2>Typhoon: A Novel</h2><p>Charles Cumming, lauded internationally as the successor to John le Carr�, returns with his biggest, most ambitious thriller to date.

The girlfriend he lost to Miles Coolidge, a hard-bitten CIA agent; the asset to collusion between his bosses and the CIA. Over ten years later, during the run-up to the Beijing Olympics, Lennox is back in China, facing his old nemeses. With the CIA plotting to use an Islamic group to destabilize China, the SIS seeking to thwart them and his old asset the key to all of this, Joe Lennox, Miles Coolidge, and the girlfriend they shared are all hopelessly intertwined in a plot where trust is impossible and truth is unknowable. <p></p></p><p>CHARLES CUMMING is the author of the international bestselling thrillers <i>A Spy By Nature </i>and <i>The Spanish Game. </i>He is a contributing editor of <i>The Week </i>magazine and currently lives in London. <p></p>"<i>Typhoon</i> is easy to like.

William Lasker, a second-string agent of the British Secret Intelligence Service, takes on the job of writing a book about a rogue CIA plot against the People's Republic of China. The action, which takes place mainly in Hong Kong and Shanghai, focuses on Joe Lennox, an SIS undercover agent in China, and an older CIA veteran, Miles Coolidge. Several months before the turnover of Hong Kong to Chinese rule in 1997, a defector, Professor Wang Kaixuan, climbs out of the South China Sea and announces he has important secret information. After the professor disappears, Joe slowly learns the defector has become part of Typhoon, a secret CIA plan being run by Miles whose aim is to destabilize China.

He lives in Bethany, Connecticut, and Paris.<b>Chapter One: Edward</b><br><br>The person whose amassing of a fortune made all the collecting and high living possible was Edward Cabot Clark. Edward&#x2019;s grandsons&#x2014;Sterling and Stephen and their brothers, Edward and Ambrose&#x2014;would not have been who they were without the wealth they acquired thanks to Edward&#x2019;s phenomenal business success. They reaped the rewards of their grandfather&#x2019;s financial acumen, legal expertise, and common sense; and Sterling and Stephen, if not the other two, also felt the imprint of Edward&#x2019;s personality. While on the surface Edward, a Sunday-school teacher as well as a lawyer, was a man of traditional bearing who comported himself with conservative demeanor, he was intensely strong-willed, determined, and uncompromising, as well as crafty. Even if their own father, Edward&#x2019;s son Alfred, was a bird of a different feather, Edward&#x2019;s triumph in the world of commerce gave Sterling and Stephen their mettle and sense of entitlement.<br><br>The mild-mannered but tough man whose estate of twenty-five million dollars, no mean sum in 1882, allowed his heirs to do everything they did gave the impression of being an ordinary upright citizen, but he had a phenomenal grasp of power. He recognized the possession of patents as a key to triumph in commerce; and he had rare acuity about the needs and desires of ordinary citizens. With nerves of steel, and his finger on the pulse of the average American housewife, this well-situated business lawyer in New York City had at a young age burst beyond the confines of his milieu. On the surface he appeared to be an ordinary civic leader of correct bearing. When he died after thirty years of growing his money into the stratosphere, one of his business associates interviewed for his obituary simply called him &#x201c;quiet and undemonstrative.&#x201d;[1] A manager in one of his businesses credited him with a bit more aplomb as &#x201c;a delightful companion, genial, entertaining and witty,&#x201d;[2] but no one seemed to know what a fighter he was. The realities of Edward&#x2019;s professional life, however, were grounded in the rough-and-tumble: nasty litigation, and an affiliation with one of the most uncouth people who ever lived.<br><br>The reason for the family fortune is that Edward Clark had allied himself with the sewing machine developer, Isaac Merritt Singer. These two very different men achieved their meteoric rise in the world of commerce in perfect tandem, to such an extent that the outrageous Singer was a major part of the family legacy. Singer would become infinitely better known, in large part because his name was on every one of those machines that entered households, at first all over America and then worldwide. But without Edward, Singer would not have succeeded, and the two men&#x2019;s lives were closely intertwined. The financial benefits that Edward reaped on such an enormous scale were inextricably connected with Isaac Singer&#x2019;s drive and inventiveness, but turning those qualities into a vast fortune was something both men owed to Edward&#x2019;s shrewdness.<br><br>The natures of these two exceptional men profoundly affected the fate as well as the personal values of their heirs. Sterling and Stephen Clark were to the manor born, but they grew up with a keen awareness of Edward&#x2019;s business partner, a true heathen who exemplified eccentric creativity and personal flamboyance. Sterling and Stephen would resemble Isaac Singer even more than their grandfather in the scale on which they lived and the extent of their personal extravagance, as well as their obsession with the culture of Paris, even if they modeled much about themselves on Edward&#x2014;each in a different way&#x2014;and bore many echoes of his strong character.<br><br>The most attractive aspect of their grandfather to penetrate Sterling and Stephen was his strong social consciousness and belief in using his position for the benefits of humankind. &#x201c;The high moral beliefs of its controlling founder&#x201d; caused the Singer Sewing Machine Company to treat its employees &#x201c;without regard to race or creed&#x201d; and, as it developed outposts and marketed its products all over the world, to have its manuals translated into fifty languages&#x2014;an unusual step that was counter to the practices of many businesses in the era of colonialism. Even before the United States Civil War, the word &#x201c;singer&#x201d; was becoming synonymous with &#x201c;sewing&#x201d; and &#x201c;sewing machine&#x201d; in many tongues, indicating the reason the company was seen at the forefront of the idea of globalization.[3] For Edward Clark, that penetration into many different societies inspired a sense of responsibility to humanity at large that he would pass to subsequent generations&#x2014;although sometimes the notion of knowing best would have outrageous ramifications.<br>Born on December 19, 1811, in the small town of Athens in New York state&#x2019;s Greene County, Edward started life in relatively easy circumstances given the rigors of life in early-nineteenth-century rural America. His family belonged to the upper-middle-class establishment that had begun to take root in the recently formed United States. Two years before his birth, his father, Nathan Clark, had established the Athens Pottery Works. It was a successful business, known nationwide, and Nathan and his wife, the former Julia Nichols, brought up their three sons&#x2014;Edward was followed by Nathan Henry and Nathan Jr.&#x2014;in comfortable circumstances. Nathan Sr. was a senior warden in the Episcopal Church and well respected in the community. This highly rational man would be alive for most of Edward&#x2019;s life&#x2014;he lived to be ninety-two years old, predeceasing his oldest son by only two years&#x2014;and was always the foil to Edward&#x2019;s more colorful life. He was described in his obituary as &#x201c;one of the sturdy, active but modest men who make their mark in American life without creating excitement.&#x201d;[4] This &#x201c;prudent, temperate&#x201d; man did, in a small way, what his son Edward would do on an infinitely larger scale by virtually monopolizing the sale of pottery in northern New York State and then establishing branches to increase the territory in which his wares were sold. He helped build the local church and was known for his generous giving to charity. If his descendants would not completely follow his model of being &#x201c;free from ostentation&#x201d; and certainly would not emulate the way he never left his small hometown, they nonetheless maintained his consciousness of the needs of his community.<br><br>Edward had a tutor at home before going to learn Latin at a local academy run by E. King, Esq., one of the first men ever to be graduated from Williams College. When he was twelve, Edward began four years of education at the Academy in Lenox, Massachusetts, where he perfected his knowledge of Latin and added Greek to his studies; he also became a voracious reader, devouring every single book&#x2014;there were about five hundred&#x2014;in the school library. But he disliked boarding-school life sufficiently to declare to the powers there early on that he was leaving, whereupon he walked home. His mother was happy to receive him, but his father escorted him back&#x2014;on horseback&#x2014;the next day. This became a routine&#x2014;his leaving, his father patiently taking him back&#x2014;until he settled in.<br><br>Young Edward was transformed in the course of those years. A lonely outsider at the start, he eventually made good friends. He got used to the toughness of the teachers. And he emerged physically from being &#x201c;of slight, delicate frame, and almost sickly in constitution,&#x201d; to becoming &#x201c;a trained athlete&#x201d; with muscles &#x201c;like steel.&#x201d;[5] The mix of vulnerability and fitness would pass to his art-collecting grandsons, each of whom was tall and lean.<br><br>In the fall of 1826, Edward Clark went on, at age sixteen, to Williams College, from which he was graduated in 1830. To enter the legal profession back then, one could train by preparing legal papers in an existing office rather than attending law school; and that same year Edward started work at the law firm of Ambrose L. Jordan in Hudson, New York. He was admitted to practice three years later, setting up a law office in Poughkeepsie.<br><br>Edward&#x2019;s early life flowed according to the rulebook of America&#x2019;s most privileged population. His education and the launching of his career had gone easily and were right on target. With his straight, broad nose, perfectly formed mouth that seemed to have been drawn after a Roman statue, and large, ovoid face framed by a neat, well- trimmed beard that formed a precise curve along his jawbone and chin, the young lawyer had an appearance of rectitude. His waved, shiny wig bordered his high, wide forehead like a drapery; everything about his looks was aimed to suggest dignity, including the wire-rimmed spectacles that provided a certain tenor of seriousness. He was cut of the same cloth as most of the ancestors of characters in Henry James&#x2019;s novels: as a comfortable member of the new American establishment.<br><br>In 1835, this distinguished young man married his boss&#x2019;s good-looking eldest daughter, Caroline. Although he practiced law independently in Poughkeepsie from 1833 to 1837&#x2014;as if following the notion that a bit of independence is requisite even for those born with a silver spoon&#x2014;in 1837 he formed a partnership with his father-in-law. Although recent accounts say that Jordan had moved his practice to New York City in 1836, both Edward Clark&#x2019;s obituary, written by one of his friends in 1882, and a tribute to him written by his nephew seem more reliable sources&#x2014;as they do for information on the precise chronology of Edward&#x2019;s connection with Isaac Singer, where there are also discrepancies&#x2014;and according to those texts the partnership first moved to New York in May of 1838. In any case, Jordan &amp; Clark soon was considered &#x201c;New York City&#x2019;s most prestigious law firm,&#x201d;[6] and it benefited immensely from Ambrose Jordan&#x2019;s position as state&#x2019;s attorney general.<br><br>In 1836, Edward and Caroline Clark had had their first child, a son they named Ambrose Jordan Clark. In 1838, their second son, Edward Loraine Clark, was born; in 1841, he was followed by a sister, Julia, but she lived for little more than two months. In 1844, their fourth and last child, Alfred Corning Clark&#x2014;the only one who would outlive his father&#x2014;appeared. It was in this period of raising his young family while living in New York City that Edward Clark&#x2019;s life, and fortune, gained a momentum that thrust him into a very different world.<br><br>...<br><br>Edward Clark&#x2019;s background and temperament could hardly have been less like that of the man whose situation he would change immeasurably and whose temerity would in turn have such an effect on his own fortune. Isaac Merritt Singer, also born in 1811&#x2014;in Pittstown, a small town not far from Rochester in upstate New York&#x2014; was the son of a German immigrant and an American mother who died young. Singer grew up in dire poverty and left home at age twelve. For the following seven years, he worked in Rochester at any job he could find where unskilled labor was required. Then, at nineteen, he became an apprentice machinist, working for four months in a machine shop.<br><br>This was when the penniless lad married the fifteen-year-old Catharine Haley. They quickly had a son, and Singer was perpetually desperate for enough money simply to eat and to have a roof over their heads. They then sought refuge with Catharine&#x2019;s parents in New York City, where Singer began to make &#x201c;a good living because of his mechanical cleverness&#x201d; and had a series of jobs that broadened his experience of machinery.[7] But after little time the young couple and their baby took off for nine years of a completely itinerant life, in which they traveled around from state to state with everything they owned in a wagon.<br><br>Singer was six feet four inches tall, and of massive build. He stood like an operatic lothario, and had a broad chest and bulging stomach to match the role. If Edward&#x2019;s beard was neatly confined to the bottom of his face, Singer had a handlebar mustache that twirled beyond the boundaries of his massive head, and his full beard looked as if it had been cultivated for maximum bushiness, hanging below his sternum. Singer spoke in a stentorian voice, and when he wasn&#x2019;t working in tool shops he was performing as an actor, generally in plays by Shakespeare.<br><br>But neither Singer&#x2019;s size nor his imposing appearance prevented him from being the butt of some vicious teasing in the workplace. In the town of Newark, New York, not far from Rochester, and not to be confused with the city of the same name in New Jersey, Singer worked in a large foundry and machine shop where carding machines and other devices to manufacture cloth were built. The journeyman apprentice had a hard time; the owner would &#x201c;tell of the ridicule Singer had to endure from his fellow-workers for his cranky notions.&#x201d;[8] It was when he was in that shop that he began to develop the idea that evolved into his sewing machine, but for which he was &#x201c;subjected to the jibes and jokes of his fellow workmen who doubted the practicality of the machine.&#x201d;[9]<br><br>That ability to withstand taunts, and to survive the consequences of an inventive mind that was out of sync with the less creative approach of the surrounding population, became part of the Clarks&#x2019; family lore. Different as Edward Cabot Clark was from Isaac Singer, and however staid his own background and that in which his heirs were raised, they grew up knowing the real pros and cons of original thinking.<br><br>In 1836, Singer joined a traveling theater company. In Baltimore, he met a young actress, Mary Ann Sponseler, and the next year he fathered two more children, a daughter with his wife and a son with Sponseler. Then, in 1839, Isaac Singer got his first patent. At the time he was working with one of his brothers, who was digging a waterway in Illinois; the patent was for a machine for drilling rock. The two thousand dollars the device garnered enabled him to found an acting troupe of his own. It was called the Merritt Players, and he was now Isaac Merritt, while Sponsler became &#x201c;Mrs. Merritt.&#x201d; The troupe ran out of money in Fredericksburg, Ohio, where Singer patented his next machine, a device for carving wood-block type. Singer moved on to New York, where this second tool became sufficiently important to warrant his seeking help from Jordan &amp; Clark in 1848.<br><br>Ambrose Jordan, however, found Singer &#x201c;too personally distasteful to represent.&#x201d; But he must have seen something in the cretin, for he &#x201c;referred him to his son-in-law.&#x201d;[10] Between 1836 and 1844, Edward and Caroline Clark had had four children, and the young lawyer was leading a life that was not out of the norm for a hardworking family man who simply accepted his obligations and took on any tasks that came his way. The dour Edward Cabot Clark&#x2019;s first task with his colorful client was to straighten out problems concerning his title to the invention for carving type. Edward helped Singer with his patent, which was awarded in 1849, and the following year Singer assigned Edward three-eighths of it, apparently in lieu of paying legal fees that the penniless inventor could not afford.[11]<br><br>In many respects, Singer and Clark were like oil and water. Besides being a Williams graduate, an attorney, and a well-connected man with a traditional marriage, Edward was a deeply religious man who, at the start of his legal career had also taught Sunday school. The &#x201c;straight-laced lawyer&#x201d;[12] served as the p...</p><h2>Pattern Making (Portfolio Skills)</h2><p>An introduction to the basic principles of pattern cutting, this practical book shows students how to interpret the human form and look at clothing through the eyes of a designer rather than a consumer. As well as explaining the proportions of human anatomy, the book introduces key tools and then takes the reader from simple pattern-cutting ideas to more advanced creative methods. Finally, the book looks at the work of fashion designers who are masters of pattern cutting, such as Comme des GarCons, John Galliano, Yohji Yamamoto and Issey Miyake. With photographs of final and dissected garments, along with CAD/CAM diagrams to explain how those pieces were cut, the book will gradually build an understanding of pattern cutting, and enable students to experiment and create exciting patterns for their own designs.</p><p>Dennic Chunman Lo is Director of the Creative Pattern Cutting course at London College of Fashion.

More than a century after her death, Louisa May Alcott&#39;s stories continue to delight readers of all ages.Kindergarten-Grade 4-A picture-book adaptation of a classic holiday story that retains most of the major elements of the original, including Gram's misunderstood illness, the feigned bear attack, and the sisters' culinary foibles. While the adaptor's changes seem aimed at making the story more accessible to contemporary readers, this pared-down version unfortunately lacks the spirit of Alcott's creation. Dialogue has been edited to make it simpler and more straightforward, but much of the poetry and language of the time has been lost. Also missing are the subtle but realistic details and descriptions that create the sense of the era. Sprightly line-and-wash illustrations complement the theme of good humor and family love. The full-page spreads are framed in country patterned borders, which add to the feeling of nostalgic storytelling. Like the text, the illustrations are adequate, but lack richness and character. Michael McCurdy's version (Holiday, 1989) has more of the flavor of the original story, but offers less visual appeal to young children.

Is it the quality of her surroundings, her china and linens, the savory surprises at her table, the diversity of the people she gathers around her, or simply her ability to put guests at ease? As Nan Kempner shows in <b>R.S.V.P.</b>, it is all this and much more. <br><br>New York hostess extraordinaire and inveterate guest of some of the world's most accomplished, Nan Kempner offers a tantalizing glimpse into the homes -- and entertaining philosophies -- of more than two dozen of her favorite hosts and hostesses. With twenty complete menus, <b>R.S.V.P.</b> divulges tried-and-true strategies for a large range of events, from a dockside breakfast to a gala sit-down dinner. Here is a casual city luncheon hosted by Crown Princess Pavlos of Greece; cocktails on the Grand Canal in Venice with Larry Lovett; Anne Bass's fall-inspired country menu; the raucous Texas-sized cookout served by Lynn Wyatt; and a full-scale boar hunt on the Loire Valley estate of Count Hubert and Countess Isabelle d'Ornano.<br><br>For each event, Nan recollects the mood at the table and the individual elements that made each gathering so exceptional.

Stunning color photographs showcase each house and vividly re-create these events.</p><p>Nan Kempner knows her parties. As part of the Park Avenue <i>haut monde</i>, she has entertained, and been entertained, by a heady mixture of the social and talented (and those who are both). In <i>R.S.V.P.</i> she introduces readers to more than two dozen of her favorite hosts, who provide menus and entertaining strategies for a range of choice events. These run the gamut from dockside breakfasts to candlelit dinners deluxe. The 120 or so recipes included produce elegant yet uncomplicated fare that should delight anyone's guests without taxing the cook. Glimpses into the homes (or in one case, the yacht) of the likes of Oscar and Annette de la Renta, designer Valentino Garavani, and artist Ross Bleckner, via words and pictures, entice the voyeur in us all, while graceful notes provide an idea of who the party givers are.<p> Divided into sections that feature lunches, informal dinners, buffets, and galas, the book offers, for example, the Corn and Feta Souffl� of Princess Marie Chantal of Greece, served at a light lunch, and the savory Mushroom Tart of vineyard patrons Carole and Fran�ois Rochas, prepared for a "perfect" fall repast. Desserts aren't neglected and include the likes of Orange Floating Island and Fig Sorbet with "Queen of Sheba" Chocolate Cookies. A final section, "Me and More Friends," brings Kempner herself onstage with her recipe for beignet-like Pet de Nonnes, as well as offering formulas for Bill Blass's Sour Cream Souffl� and Nancy Reagan's Currant Cookies, among others.

But we are at liberty to disclose that Graham Greene called it the "finest spy story ever written," and that the taut tale concerns Alec Leamas, a British agent in early Cold War Berlin. Leamas is responsible for keeping the double agents under his care undercover and alive, but East Germans start killing them, so he gets called back to London by Control, his spy master. Yet instead of giving Leamas the boot, Control gives him a scary assignment: play the part of a disgraced agent, a sodden failure everybody whispers about. Control sends him back out into the cold--deep into Communist territory to checkmate the bad-guy spies on the other side. The political chessboard is black and white, but in human terms the vicinity of the Berlin Wall is a moral no-man's land, a gray abyss patrolled by pawns.<p> Le Carr� beats most spy writers for two reasons. First, he knows what he's talking about, since he raced around working for British Intelligence while the Wall went up. He's familiar with spycraft's fascinations, but also with the fact that it leaves ideals shaken and emotions stirred. Second, his literary tone has deep autobiographical roots. Spying is about betrayal, and Le Carr� was abandoned by his mother and betrayed by his father, a notorious con man. (They figure heavily in his novels <i>Single &amp; Single</i> and <i>A Perfect Spy</i>.) In a world of lies, Le Carr� writes the bitter truth: it's every man for himself. And may the best mask win. <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p>"Le Carre is simply the world's greatest fictional spymaster."<br>NEWSWEEK<br>For Leamas the espionage business has become an hermetic, enclosed world, detached from outside reality. He has watched his last agent being shot, crossing from East to West Berlin, and his death marks the end of the Circus' East German network. But Control is planning an operation against the head of East German Intelligence. And Leamas is to be the instrument, set in East one last time....</p><h2>Lamentation (The Shardlake Series, 6)</h2><p>While King Henry VIII lies on his deathbed, Queen Catherine Parr searches for the person who murdered the London printer who had her shocking, confessional memoir.

R. Covey, Author, <em>The Speed of Trust</em></strong></p> <p>I'll never forget an experience several years ago when our company had been working with two distinct suppliers to provide the same product for our business. On paper, the suppliers looked similar. Both had good people and reputations. We started off trusting them both. But while one supplier consistently performed, the other one didn't. Our trust in the one grew and in the other shrank. We had to put in place redundant inspection processes for the supplier that was inconsistent, which cost us extra time and money, causing our product costs to rise. We ultimately decided to drop that supplier and just go with the one we trusted.</p> <p>After this experience, I found myself noticing everywhere the same phenomenon: that the economic implications of trust were as great as, if not greater than, the social implications. I ran with this simple insight and began to see the impact of trust&#x2014;or the lack thereof&#x2014;everywhere. I found that when I consciously focused on trusting and being trusted, it brought great success&#x2014;and when trust was neglected or ignored, I paid the price. I eventually concluded that trust is the one thing that changes everything, and today I am only more convinced that is true. This conviction, along with empirical data and a personal sense of passion for this topic, led to the development and publication of my book, The Speed of Trust: The One Thing that Changes Everything.</p> <p>Because trust is such a simple idea, it is typically underestimated, assumed and taken for granted. It seems we only appreciate it after we lose it. Yet this oft-neglected subject of trust has yielded untold layers of depth as our company has explored its many uses and applications among individuals, teams, organizations, and society. Most fascinating, even with all the work we've done in dozens of countries, I believe we've only just scratched the surface. There is much more work to do, and that's what excites me most. That is why I am so pleased to have on my team practitioners like Barry Rellaford and David Hutchens, who help our trust approach come to life. Barry has served as one of the chief architects and global advocates for our approach, while David has developed learning tools and products that even today are helping our practice lead a transformation of trust all around the world.</p> <p>These authors understand trust. Barry, more than anyone, helped me shape and mold the ideas and terms in The Speed of Trust. He has been a constant supporter and expert advisor for the work we're doing. Most significantly, he has been an insightful coach and facilitator in working with client organizations throughout the world, particularly with executive teams, in teaching and helping them implement the Speed of Trust on their teams and in their organizations in order to achieve sustained superior performance.</p> <p>David, in turn, has paid the price to master our content, which, coupled with his innate gifts of writing and storytelling, has given him the ability to convey key messages in a way that is both simple and profound. He understands how people and organizations learn, and he's created tools and processes to enable and accelerate that learning. The combination of Barry and David in producing this wonderful book is an illustration of the speed of trust in action!</p> <p>When they first approached me about this project, I must admit I was a bit skeptical. I'm typically not a big fan of fables&#x2014;many of them aren't very well told or the stories often get in the way of the message or they come across as naively simplistic. But because I trusted the authors, I agreed to read their story and was delightfully surprised. As well as I know the topic of trust and what we've learned together in taking this message to individuals and organizations everywhere, I was still captivated by the characters and flow of the narrative&#x2014;and laughed as I read about Simon's and Sebastian's choices and the consequences of the subsequent actions. Every time I found myself worrying about the message possibly missing an important idea, the authors had anticipated that very point, which would soon manifest itself as the story continued in greater depth. I was pleased-and impressed.</p> <p>A Slice of Trust depicts the purposeful balance of choice, analysis, emotion, judgment and personal courage required for exercising trust. As you join Simon the Pieman on his adventures in trust, I invite you to reflect on how you have extended trust in your organization, your relationships, your family, your world. After all, the most important story is your story. It's a story that you create every day as you explore opportunities for trust. And it's a story whose telling is brought to life every time you extend your trust to another, one slice at a time.</p> <p>So, welcome to this conversation on trust down a different- yet parallel-path from The Speed of Trust. As you experience the Speed of Trust in your world, we'd like to hear from you. Tell us your challenges in practicing "Smart Trust." Let us know where your journey is taking you and how we might help you take the next step. Along the way, I am confident that you will discover, as I have, that nothing is as fast as, more inspiring than, more satisfying than, or more filling than a simple slice of trust.</p><p>Could your organization use A Slice of Trust?</p> <p>In a faraway village, Simon the Pieman operates an organization not so different from your own. His secret to success? To grow &#x201c;Smart Trust,&#x201d; one slice at a time.

Wouldn&#39;t you love a faster, lighter take on osso buco (here made with turkey instead of veal), a salad with real substance (like one of cantaloupe, red onion, and walnuts), and fish that gets an Italian makeover by way of lots of fresh veggies and accents such as fennel and grapefruit salsa?

Ranging from soups and snacks to easy entr�es and elegant dinner-party fare, Giada&#39;s recipes are perfect for any day of the week. And for the first time, she includes a full section of dishes that the little ones will love making as much as they love eating (like mini chicken meatballs).

If watermelon is not in season you can substitute cantaloupe, but for a burst of pure flavor that really plays off the herbal flavor of the tomatoes, you can&#x2019;t beat watermelon. Stacking the skewers vertically and serving them upright looks especially elegant.<br><br> <b>6 to 8 servings<br><br> </b>� cup balsamic vinegar<br> � cup sugar<br> 1 4- to 5-pound seedless watermelon <br> 60 small basil leaves (or torn larger leaves)<br> 16 cherry tomatoes, halved<br> 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil<br> Coarse or kosher salt<br> Special equipment: 16 (6-inch) wooden skewers<br><br> Combine the balsamic vinegar and sugar in a small nonreactive saucepan. Bring to a simmer over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the sugar is dissolved. Remove from the heat and set aside to cool.<br><br> Cut the top and bottom off the watermelon, then make 4 straight cuts down the sides so you have a cube of rindless watermelon. Cut the cube into 1�-inch slices, then cut the slices into 1�-inch cubes. Assemble the skewers by pushing a basil leaf to the end of one skewer. Then skewer a cube of watermelon, then a tomato half. Continue with another watermelon cube, basil leaf, and tomato half, ending with a basil leaf.

He has performed in MGM musicals, co-wrote one of the enduring Christmas classics, "The Christmas Song (Chestnuts Roasting on an Open Fire)," and was recently profiled in <em>Life</em> magazine as one of the greatest living jazz singers. But Torm� has also written five books, including <em>The Other Side of the Rainbow</em>, Torm�'s account of his year working on the Judy Garland television show--considered the best portrait of Garland ever written. In this book, Torm� writes a brilliant biography of his friend of forty years--the drummer Buddy Rich.<br> Buddy Rich was one of the most famous drummers of the Swing Era, having starred in the Artie Shaw and Tommy Dorsey bands. After World War II he successfully led several of his own bands. Born into a vaudeville family, Buddy performed on the drums in his parents' act before he was two years old--where he was billed as "Traps, the Drum Wonder"--and became the highest paid child performer in the world by age four. This early fame--and Buddy's abusive father--left psychological scars on Rich, who developed an abrasive personality, and would beat his drums as an outlet for his frustrations. Although a close friend and admirer, Torm� pulls no punches when it comes to describing Rich's occasional outbursts and his sometimes childish pranks. But, as Torm� shows, Buddy could also be charming, affectionate, and funny, as he demonstrated during his frequent appearances as a guest on the <em>Tonight</em> show. (When Rich died, Johnny Carson proclaimed, "The world lost a genius, and I lost a friend.") We also find tales of Buddy's stormy friendship with Frank Sinatra (his first roommate on tour with the Tommy Dorsey band), and his romance with Lana Turner (Buddy's first serious love affair).<br> More than anything, of course, Rich was a brilliant musician, and he earned many tributes from jazz musicians ("What Buddy could do with a couple of pieces of wood was uncanny," remembers drummer Alvin Stoller). Torme shows a deep understanding of the life of a jazzman, and the many challenges and vicissitudes that are involved with it. We learn of the problems of holding a swing band together during an era when bebop ruled, follow Buddy in his search for the perfect snare drum, and observe the many "drum-offs" when Rich proved his unmatchable talent in friendly competition with other talented drummers, such as Gene Krupa.<br> The Buddy Rich story is a fascinating one, as much for what it says about the world of American music and entertainment as for the remarkable life it portrays. Drawing from magazines and many personal reminiscences, Torm� packs this biography with vivid, often funny, anecdotes. His personal touch and his in-depth knowledge of jazz make for a moving, insightful, and often hilarious biography.</p><p><br><em>About the Author:</em><br> <strong>Mel Torme</strong> is a world renowned jazz singer/musician, and is the author of five books, including <em>The Other Side of the Rainbow</em>.<br>From jazz singer Torm&#x201a; (It Wasn't All Velvet, 1988, etc.)--an engaging warts-and-all life of the world's greatest drummer, Buddy Rich. A life of Rich has its problems, particularly his terrible mouth, which stripped flesh from bone without a second's notice and for next to no reason. At 18 months, Rich joined his parents on the vaudeville stage as a wonderchild of the drums. Soon ``Traps'' was a featured act, at last getting top billing wherever he played. Completely lacking a formal education, Rich spent his whole life on the road. An adulated jazz drummer who drew shouting audiences to their feet daily and became the featured soloist of famed swing bands led by Harry James, Tommy Dorsey, Benny Goodman, Artie Shaw, etc., the performer lived an emotionally surreal life. On top of this, though he didn't drink (it would have ruined his timing), he smoked pot daily from age 18 onward. As with heavy dope-smoker Bob Marley, Torm&#x201a; wonders whether pot contributed to the brain tumors that finally killed Rich. In some ways, the drummer's greatest successes were with others' big bands. His own big band (first underwritten by fellow Dorseyite Frank Sinatra) folded time and time again. Rich made many movies and became a regular on The Tonight Show, his acerbic barbs delighting drum-lover Johnny Carson. But he lost friend after friend, his vitriol scarring all without reservation, though he mellowed late in life when the birth of a grandchild somehow freed him to love himself through the baby. Otherwise, he seemed entirely without feeling, until one day he dragged Torm&#x201a; to see his favorite film, Norma Shearer's Smilin' Through. Torm&#x201a; got MGM to put the movie on videocassette as a present for Rich, but Rich alienated Torm&#x201a; by vilely insulting him at the very moment the present was given. Exceptional on music biz and drum techniques while humanizing an emotional monster. A labor of love. -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

In the late 20th century, some scientists have taken to using an alternative system called <i>cladistics</i>, which bases taxonomic classifications on ecological relationships. Under the first system, all algae fall into a single large category, which is then subdivided into various genera and species; under the second, green algae are grouped with plants, chromophyte algae with waterborne fungi, and so forth to account for the environments in which they live. Under the first system, dogs and wolves and coyotes are separated; under the second, they are united, for, the thinking goes, similarities of behavior and provenance are more important than mere lines of evolutionary descent, which can only be guessed at.<p> The debate over cladistics has largely been confined to seminar rooms and laboratories. Henry Gee brings it to the general public in this spirited look at how the science of paleontology, that grand tour of what Gee calls Deep Time, is conducted. Replacing old family trees with "cladograms," Gee challenges long-accepted notions about the past (for example, the classification of <i>Archaeopteryx</i>, which walks like a duck and quacks like a duck but is accounted for as a dinosaur) and argues for a return to rigor in testing hypotheses. His book, although about difficult issues, is immediately accessible, and readers seeking to learn something about cladistics--which Gee believes is "a revolution in thought as profound as that of Darwinian evolution by natural selection"--are off to a fine start in these pages. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p><b>Henry Gee, Ph.D.</b> received his doctorate in zoology from Cambridge University and has taught at the University of California, Los Angeles.

The large red letters in the title attracted me to the book and as a young student trying to understand how to make this world a better place, I decided to pick it up. I thought I new everything about socialism and its history in the world. I was wrong. Michael Harrington highlights very important concepts such as the idea that socialism was impossible to construct in poor nations like Cuba, North Korea, Vietnam and even the U.S.S.R. and that thus the governments of these countries had to resort to repressive measures in order to maintain their control. Instead, he proposes (as Marx did too) that socialism must gain hold first in nations with &#34;abundance&#34; like the United States, England, France, Germany, etc. Furthermore, he reiterates that socialism MUST be democratic or it is not socialism. It either is people&#39;s socialism (bottom-up socialism) or it is anti-socialist &#34;Socialism&#34; (top-down socialism). Michael covers a lot of theoretical AND practical ground (a rarity in books regarding socialism) and it is great for beginners as well as serious readers of socialist ideas (like myself). The book gave me hope and I&#39;m sure others will get that feeling too. It is a shame that God claimed his life already (Michael died of cancer in 1989), but I hope his life&#39;s devotion (struggle for democratic socialism) some day gives fruit. Thanks Michael.

She has written three other health books and is contributing editor to <i>Natural Health</i> magazine.PART ONE The History of Magnesium<br><br>CHAPTER 1 The Case for Magnesium: The Personal History of an Element<br><br>Mary joked that she felt as though she was constantly being run over by a slow-moving bus. Cramping in her legs startled her awake at night, making her an insomniac, and she had heart palpitations daily. Her doctor also found that she had high blood sugar-not bad enough to need injections of insulin, but he prescribed pills to try to stimulate more insulin production. Finally, frightening panic attacks came out of nowhere and made this vibrant, fun-loving woman afraid to go outside.<br><br>To try to relieve her leg cramps, Mary began taking calcium at night, having read that it was good for cramps and sleep. At first, the calcium seemed to help, but after a week or two, the pains got worse. If she yawned and stretched in bed, her calf muscles would seize up and catapult her to the floor, where she would lie frantically massaging her muscles to try to release the spasm. All the next day, she would limp about with a very tender, bruised feeling in her calf.<br><br>Although Mary's heart palpitations had improved somewhat after she'd given up her three cups of coffee a day, they too resumed after a few weeks. Every time the palpitations occurred, which was several times a day, they made her cough slightly and catch her breath. She found it frightening, even though her doctor said her stress tests for heart disease were fine and she didn't need further testing with an angiogram.<br><br>Both Mary's parents had had adult-onset diabetes, and Mary knew that she should watch her diet, but she was overweight and craved sugary and high-carbohydrate foods that were hard to resist. When the panic attacks hit on top of everything else, Mary knew she had to seek help, and came to my office. She was only fifty-three, far too young to be feeling so bad, and was worried about her future health.<br><br>Sam was only forty-nine and experiencing chest pains. At first, he thought they were indigestion, but sometimes the pains would occur in the middle of the night. Concerned, he went to a cardiologist, who found two slightly blocked arteries, not serious enough for bypass surgery. Sam's cholesterol was somewhat elevated, as was his blood pressure, which he attributed to his high-stress occupation and the fact that he had not exercised regularly for the past six months, when he was sidelined with back pain. The cardiologist observed that his arterial blockage would almost inevitably worsen over time and eventually necessitate surgery. The doctor offered him medication for his high cholesterol, told him not to eat butter or eggs, and gave him nitroglycerine to take whenever he had the pain. If the symptoms got worse, he would prescribe other medications. Sam couldn't imagine having to wait to get worse before doing something about his chest pain; he knew there must be something more he could do to avoid surgery and came to me for advice.<br><br>At thirty-five, Jan had actually begun to look forward to going through menopause. That's how bad her PMS symptoms were. As soon as those horrible feelings lifted, she was hit by the sledgehammer of menstrual cramps. She also had migraines, which for years had come before her period but now were occurring once or twice a week. She was so miserable that she was considering a complete hysterectomy, with removal of her hormone-producing ovaries, but wondered whether the migraines, since they were happening all month, were not actually hormonal.<br><br>Different as their symptoms are, Mary, Sam, and Jan all suffer from magnesium deficiency. While women and men seem equally susceptible to magnesium deficiency, women may become deficient faster than men due to hormonal fluctuations because pound for pound, they have fewer circulating red blood cells, which carry magnesium, and so perhaps less magnesium available. There are a few other gender differences. Because of magnesium's effect on hormonal regulation and vice versa, women can have deficiencies in pregnancy, when breast-feeding, with premenstrual syndrome (PMS), and with dysmenorrhea (painful periods). Osteoporosis, which affects more women than men, is evidence of a deficiency of both calcium and magnesium. An overactive thyroid, which afflicts more women than men, increases the metabolic rate, which uses up magnesium-requiring ATP (adenosine triphosphate-the energy packets made in each cell in the body. Without magnesium, ATP would not be produced). Let's follow Mary, Sam, and Jan and see how they overcame their magnesium deficiencies. When Mary visited me, I charted her health history in detail, according to procedures commonly used by naturopathic doctors, and found several symptoms of magnesium deficiency. In her case it had been made even worse by too much calcium, however, so simple magnesium supplementation wouldn't be enough for Mary. Her diet and lifestyle needed a complete overhaul. I gave Mary a list of magnesium-rich foods that she needed to start eating, which included nuts, beans, greens, and seeds such as sunflower and pumpkin. Mary realized that she'd been avoiding almost all of these foods: She thought nuts were fattening, beans gave her gas, and greens never seemed fresh enough at the supermarket. She had never even thought about eating seeds. After a week of enthusiastically eating a lot more magnesium-rich foods, Mary felt somewhat better. To make sure she could get fresh organic greens regularly, she tracked down a local community-supported agriculture (CSA) program and bought a share in a neighboring organic farm. Mary also learned how to soak and cook beans to prevent them from causing gas, and began eating nuts and seeds rich in magnesium and healthy oils, such as almonds, walnuts, pecans, sunflower seeds, and pumpkin seeds. After her second visit I recommended that she begin taking magnesium supplements. Starting with a dosage of 200 mg a day, we added another 200 mg every two days to build slowly to 600 mg. I cautioned her that it could take months to eliminate magnesium deficiency symptoms and that not all her symptoms would necessarily respond. Within two months, however, Mary was singing the praises of magnesium. Her palpitations and panic attacks had disappeared. Her cravings for sweets were fewer, she was able to control her blood sugar with diet alone, and tests for blood sugar were normal. Her leg cramps were gone, and with them her insomnia. At three months we added calcium along with magnesium so that she would not develop an imbalance of the two. Mary's internist was quite surprised at her improved health and told her to keep up the good work with her diet and supplements. Sam had an inquiring mind, and I encouraged him to start reading about heart disease. He found that up to 30 percent of angina (chest pain) patients do not have badly blocked arteries but may be suffering from an electrical imbalance that is driven by mineral deficiency, most commonly magnesium.1 An astonishing 40 to 60 percent of sudden deaths from heart attack may occur in the complete absence of any prior artery blockage, clot formation or heart rhythm abnormalities, most likely from spasms in the arteries (magnesium is a natural antispasmodic).2,3,4,5 Moreover, he found that magnesium deficiency has been linked to sudden cardiac death. Sam didn't want to wait around for that to happen to him; he was determined to find out what was causing his problem and treat the cause. The more he read, the more intrigued he became. When he read that magnesium deficiency is also associated with muscle pain, especially back pain, that really got his attention, since he had begun having back pain four or five months before he began to develop chest pain.6<br><br>With a packet of information on magnesium, Sam went back to his cardiologist. Before the doctor saw him, however, a nurse took Sam's blood pressure; it was unusually elevated, even though at home it was usually only a few points above normal. (Doctor-induced hypertension is commonly reported by patients.) The cardiologist swept into the room and immediately began talking about blood pressure medication. Sam countered with magnesium. The cardiologist visibly cooled and said that magnesium was used to control hypertension that occurred in pregnant women because there were no side effects, but that there were plenty of effective drugs for everyone else. When Sam said he would rather not have side effects either, the cardiologist gathered up his file and told him to come back when he was ready to take medications for his heart disease.<br><br>When Sam came back to see me, he was still pretty upset by this encounter; he didn't like the specialist refusing to discuss a possible magnesium deficiency as part of the picture. Sam and I agreed that magnesium seemed the best treatment for him to initiate at this time since he was not willing to take medications.<br><br>Sam began adding magnesium to his diet by eating magnesium-rich foods. After a week he felt much calmer, but he still had chest and back pain. So he added magnesium and calcium supplements, and in about three months he felt almost normal.<br><br>Among the studies Sam read was one that looked at the correspondence between type A personalities and magnesium deficiency. From the description, Sam realized he was a type A, an aggressive guy who lived on adrenaline, time pressure, and stress. This type of behavior drains the body of magnesium and leads to disorders such as heart disease, muscle spasms, hypersensitivity, and irritability.7 Prolonged psychological stress raises adrenaline, the stress hormone, which depletes magnesium.8 Both Sam's back and chest pain would hit when he was under stress. So Sam worked on ways to control his stress and added more magnesium when he knew he couldn't avoid it. On days when he exercised, Sam added an extra 200 mg of magnesium to his diet, since sweat loss during heavy exercise (cycling and jogging) and working in the heat deplete magnesium. Just drinking water won't replace all the minerals lost. By paying attention to the many factors that affected his mind-body health, Sam lowered his cholesterol and stress levels and reduced ...</p><h2>The Pout-Pout Fish in the Big-Big Dark (A Pout-Pout Fish Adventure, 2)</h2><p><p><b>The funny follow up to the New York Times bestselling The Pout-Pout Fish from Deborah Diesen and Dan Hanna</b> </p><p>Mr. Fish wants to help his friend Ms. Clam when she loses her pearl, but though he's fast as a sailfish, as smart as dolphin, and as strong as a shark, Mr. Fish has a secret: he's scared of the dark! </p><p>Very young children will swim along with Mr. Fish as he journeys deep into the ocean to new and mysterious places.

How did Indian gambling become such a lucrative and commonplace fixture of the American landscape? In Wampum, Donald Craig Mitchell tells the never-before-told story.In 1979, the Mafia opened the nation's first high-stakes Indian bingo hall on the Seminole reservation in Florida. Nine years later, Indian tribes were operating bingo halls on reservations in 23 states. Congress enacted the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act to subject gambling on reservations to regulation by the federal government and the states in which the reservations were located. But, while members of Congress who voted for the bill didn't intend for it to do so, the act facilitated the transformation of Indian bingo halls into what they are today&#x2015;Las Vegas-style casinos whose gaming floors contain more than 352,000 video slot and other gaming machines. On Capitol Hill, Donald Craig Mitchell is a recognized expert on Indian law and history, and the only researcher who had early access to the records of the committees whose members and staff wrote the bills that became the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act.

The delightful result is a creation of comic genius. For in the unnaturally tall form of Professor Doctor Moritz-Maria von Igelfeld, we are invited to meet a memorable character whose sublime insouciance is a blend of the cultivated pomposity of Frasier Crane and of Inspecteur Clouseau&#39;s hapless gaucherie. Von Igelfeld inhabits the rarefied world of the Institute of Romance Philology at Regensburg, a world he shares with his equally tall and equally ridiculous colleagues, Professors Florianus Prinzel and Detlev Amadeus Unterholzer. Their unlikely adventures are described in three deliciously funny instalments: Portuguese Irregular Verbs, The Finer Points of Sausage Dogs and At the Villa of Reduced Circumstances.</p><p>Following a distinguished career as a Professor of Medical Law, Alexander McCall Smith has turned to writing full-time. He lives in Edinburgh.From <b>Portuguese Irregular Verbs</b><br><br><b>Chapter 1<br><br>The Principles of Tennis<br></b><br>Professor Dr Moritz-Maria Von Igelfeld often reflected on how fortunate he was to be exactly who he was, and nobody else. When one paused to think of who one might have been had the accident of birth not happened precisely as it did, then, well, one could be quite frankly <i>appalled</i>. Take his colleague Professor Dr Detlev Amadeus Unterholzer, for instance. Firstly, there was the name: to be called Detlev was a misfortune, but to add that ridiculous Mozartian pretension to it, and then to culminate in Unterholzer was to gild a turnip. But if one then considered Unterholzer&#x2019;s general circumstances, then Pelion was surely piled upon Ossa. Unterholzer had the double misfortune of coming from an obscure potato-growing area somewhere, a place completely without consequence, and of being burdened in this life with a large and inelegant nose. This, of course, was not something for which he could be blamed, but one might certainly criticise him, thought von Igelfeld, for carrying his nose in the way he did. A difficult nose, which can afflict anybody, may be kept in the background by a modest disposition of the head; Unterholzer, by contrast, thrust his nose forward shamelessly, as might an anteater, with the result that it was the first thing one saw when he appeared anywhere. It was exactly the wrong thing to do if one had a nose like that.<br><br>The von Igelfeld nose, by contrast, was entirely appropriate. It was not small, but then a small nose is perhaps as much of a misfortune as a large nose, lending the wearer an appearance of pettiness or even irrelevance. Von Igelfeld&#x2019;s nose tended slightly to the aquiline, which was completely becoming for the scion of so distinguished a family. The von Igelfeld name was an honourable one: <i>Igel </i>meant hedgehog in German, and von Igelfeld, therefore, was <i>hedgehogfield</i>, an irreproachable territorial reference that was reflected in the family coat of arms &#x2014; a hedgehog recumbent upon a background of vert. Unterholzer, of course, might snigger at the hedgehog, but what could he do but snigger, given that he had no armorial claims, whatever his pretensions in that direction might be.<br><br>But even if von Igelfeld was relieved that he was not Unterholzer, then he had to admit to himself that he would have been perfectly happy to have been Professor Dr Dr (<i>honoris causa</i>) Florianus Prinzel, another colleague at the Institute of Romance Philology. Prinzel was a fine man and a considerable scholar, whom von Igelfeld had met when they were both students, and whom he had long unconditionally admired. Prinzel was the athlete-poet; von Igelfeld the scholar &#x2014; well, scholar-scholar one would probably have to say. If von Igelfeld had been asked to stipulate a Platonic von Igelfeld, an ideal template for all von Igelfelds, then he would have chosen Prinzel for this without the slightest hesitation.<br><br>Of the three professors, von Igelfeld was undoubtedly the most distinguished. He was the author of a seminal work on Romance philology, <i>Portuguese Irregular Verbs</i>, a work of such majesty that it dwarfed all other books in the field. It was a lengthy book of almost twelve hundred pages, and was the result of years of research into the etymology and vagaries of Portuguese verbs. It had been well received &#x2014; not that there had ever been the slightest doubt about that &#x2014; and indeed one reviewer had simply written, &#x2018;There is nothing more to be said on this subject. Nothing.&#x2019; Von Igelfeld had taken this compliment in the spirit in which it had been intended, but there was in his view a great deal more to be said, largely by way of exposition of some of the more obscure or controversial points touched upon in the book, and for many years he continued to say it. This was mostly done at conferences, where von Igelfeld&#x2019;s papers on Portuguese irregular verbs were often the highlight of proceedings. Not that this eminence always bore the fruit that might be expected: unfortunately it was Prinzel, not von Igelfeld, who had received the honorary doctorate from the University of Palermo, and many people, including von Igelfeld, thought that this might be a case of mistaken identity. After all, from the viewpoint of the fairly diminutive Sicilian professors who bestowed the honour, three tall Germans might have been difficult to tell apart. These doubts, however, were never aired, as that would have been a breach of civility and a threat to the friendship. But just as the doubts were never mentioned, neither was the honorary doctorate.<br><br>At the Annual Congress of Romance Philology in Z�rich, the three professors decided to stay in a small village on the edge of the lake. There was an excellent train which took them into the city each morning for the meeting, and in the evening they could even return by the regular boat, which called at the jetty no more than five minutes from the hotel. It was altogether a much more satisfactory arrangement than staying in Z�rich itself, surrounded by banks and expensive watch shops. As von Igelfeld remarked to the others: &#x2018;Have you noticed how Z�rich ticks? <i>Klummit, klummit, ding! </i>I could never sleep in such a town.&#x2019;<br><br>The Hotel Carl-Gustav, in which the three professors stayed, was a large old-fashioned establishment, much favoured by families from Z�rich who wanted to get away, but not too far away. Anxious bankers, into whose very bones the Swiss work ethic had penetrated, stayed there for their holidays. It was highly convenient for them, as they could tell their wives they were going for a walk in the hotel grounds and then slip off to the railway station and be in their offices in Z�rich within twenty minutes. They could then return two hours later, to pretend that they had been in the woods or at the lakeside; whereas in reality they had been accepting deposits and discounting bills of exchange. In this way, certain Z�rich financiers had acquired the reputation of never going on holiday at all, which filled their rivals with feelings of dread and guilt.<br><br>Prinzel had arrived first, and taken the best room, the one with the uninterrupted view of the lake. He had felt slightly uneasy about this, as it was a room which should really have gone to von Igelfeld, who always got the best of everything on the strength of <i>Portuguese Irregular Verbs</i>. For this reason Prinzel was careful not to mention the view and contrived to keep von Igelfeld out of his room so he could not see it for himself. Unterholzer, who always got the worst of what was on offer, had a slightly gloomy room at the side of the hotel, above the dining room, and his view was that of the hotel tennis court.<br><br>&#x2018;I look out on to the tennis court,&#x2019; he announced one evening as the three gathered for a glass of mineral water on the hotel terrace.<br><br>&#x2018;Ah!&#x2019; said von Igelfeld. &#x2018;And have you seen people playing on this tennis court?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;I saw four Italian guests using it,&#x2019; said Prinzel. &#x2018;They played a very energetic game until one of them appeared to have a heart attack and they stopped.&#x2019;<br><br>The three professors contemplated this remarkable story for a few moments. Even here, in these perfect surroundings, where everything was so safe, so assured, mortality could not be kept at bay. The Swiss could guarantee everything, could co-ordinate anything &#x2014; but ultimately mortality was no respecter of timetables.<br><br>Then Prinzel had an idea. Tennis did not look too difficult; the long summer evening stretched out before them, and the court, since the sudden departure of the Italians, was empty.<br><br>&#x2018;We could, perhaps, have a game of tennis ourselves,&#x2019; he suggested.<br><br>The others looked at him.<br><br>&#x2018;I&#x2019;ve never played,&#x2019; said von Igelfeld.<br><br>&#x2018;Nor I,&#x2019; said Unterholzer. &#x2018;Chess, yes. Tennis, no.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;But that&#x2019;s no reason not to play,&#x2019; von Igelfeld added quickly. &#x2018;Tennis, like any activity, can be mastered if one knows the principles behind it. In that respect it must be like language. The understanding of simple rules produces an understanding of a language. What could be simpler?&#x2019;<br><br>Unterholzer and Prinzel agreed, and Prinzel was despatched to speak to the manager of the hotel to find out whether tennis equipment, and a book of the rules of tennis, could be borrowed. The manager was somewhat surprised at the request for the book, but in an old hotel most things can be found and he eventually came up with an ancient dog-eared handbook from the games cupboard. This was <i>The Rules of Lawn Tennis </i>by Captain Geoffrey Pembleton BA (Cantab.), tennis Blue, sometime county champion of Cambridgeshire; and published in 1923, <i>before the tie-breaker was invented</i>.<br><br>Armed with Pembleton&#x2019;s treatise, described by von Igelfeld, to the amusement of the others, as &#x2018;this great work of Cambridge scholarship&#x2019;, the three professors strode confidently on to the court. Captain Pembleton had thoughtfully included several chapters describing tennis technique, and here all the major strokes were illustrated with little dotted diagrams showing the movement of the arms and the disposition of the body.<br><br>It took no more than ten minutes for von Igelfeld and Prinzel to feel sufficiently confident to begin a game. Unterholzer sat on a chair at the end of the net, and declared himself the umpire. The first service, naturally, was taken by von Igelfeld, who raised his racquet in the air as recommended by Captain Pembleton, and hit the ball in the direction of Prinzel.<br><br>The tennis service is not a simple matter, and unfortunately von Igelfeld did not manage to get any of his serves over the net. Everything was a double fault.<br><br>&#x2018;Love 15; Love 30; Love 40; Game to Professor Dr Prinzel!&#x2019; called out Unterholzer. &#x2018;Professor Dr Prinzel to serve!&#x2019;<br><br>Prinzel, who had been waiting patiently to return von Igelfeld&#x2019;s serve, his feet positioned in exactly the way advised by Captain Pembleton, now quickly consulted the book to refresh his memory. Then, throwing the tennis ball high into the air, he brought his racquet down with convincing force and drove the ball into the net. Undeterred, he tried again, and again after that, but the score remained obstinately one-sided.<br><br>&#x2018;Love 15; Love 30; Love 40; Game to Professor Dr von Igelfeld!&#x2019; Unterholzer intoned. &#x2018;Professor Dr von Igelfeld to serve!&#x2019;<br><br>And so it continued, as the number of games mounted up. Neither player ever succeeded in winning a game other than by the default of the server. At several points the ball managed to get across the net, and on one or two occasions it was even returned; but this was never enough to result in the server&#x2019;s winning a game. Unterholzer continued to call out the score and attracted an occasional sharp glance from von Igelfeld, who eventually suggested that the <i>Rules of Lawn Tennis </i>be consulted to see who should win in such circumstances.<br><br>Unfortunately there appeared to be no answer. Captain Pembleton merely said that after six games had been won by one player this was a victory &#x2014; provided that such a player was at least two games ahead of his opponent. If he was not in such a position, then the match must continue until such a lead was established. <i>The problem with this, though, was that van Igelfeld and Prinzel, never winning a service, could never be more than one game ahead of each other</i>.<br><br>This awkward, seemingly irresoluble difficulty seemed to all of them to be a gross flaw in the theoretical structure of the game.<br><br>&#x2018;This is quite ridiculous,&#x2019; snorted von Igelfeld. &#x2018;A game must have a winner &#x2014; everybody knows that &#x2014; and yet this . . . this <i>stupid </i>book makes no provision for <i>moderate </i>players like ourselves!&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;I agree,&#x2019; said Prinzel, tossing down his racquet. &#x2018;Unterholzer, what about you?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;I&#x2019;m not interested in playing such a flawed game,&#x2019; said Unterholzer, with a dismissive gesture towards <i>The Rules of Lawn Tennis</i>. &#x2018;So much for Cambridge!&#x2019;<br><br>They trooped off the tennis court, not noticing the faces draw back rapidly from the windows. Rarely had the Hotel Carl-Gustav provided such entertainment for its guests.<br><br>&#x2018;Well,&#x2019; said Prinzel. &#x2018;I&#x2019;m rather hot after all that sport. I could do with a swim.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;A good idea,&#x2019; said von Igelfeld. &#x2018;Perhaps we should do that.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Do you swim?&#x2019; asked Unterholzer, rather surprised by the sudden burst of physical activity.<br><br>&#x2018;Not in practice,&#x2019; said von Igelfeld. &#x2018;But it has never looked difficult to me. One merely extends the arms in the appropriate motion and then retracts them, thereby propelling the body through the water.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;That&#x2019;s quite correct,&#x2019; said Prinzel. &#x2018;I&#x2019;ve seen it done many times. In fact, this morning some of the other guests were doing it from the hotel jetty. We could borrow swimming costumes from the manager.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Then let&#x2019;s all go and swim,&#x2019; said von Igelfeld, enthusiastically. &#x2018;Dinner&#x2019;s not for another hour or so, and it would refresh us all,&#x2019; adding, with a glance at Unterholzer, &#x2018;players and otherwise.&#x2019;<br><br>The waters were cool and inviting. Out on the lake, the elegant white yachts dipped their tall sails in the breeze from the mountains. From where they stood on the jetty, the three professors could, by craning their necks, see the point where Jung in his study had pondered our collective dreams. As von Igelfeld had pointed out, swimming was simple, in theory.<br><br>Inside the Hotel Carl-Gustav, the watching guests waited, breathless in their anticipation.</p><h2>The Fruit Expert</h2><p>The essential guide to growing all types of fruit.

Known in the U.S. primarily as Merton&#x2019;s best friend and in Europe as a daringly original avant-garde poet, Lax left behind a promising New York writing career to travel with a circus, live among immigrants in post-war Marseilles and settle on a series of remote Greek islands where he learned and recorded the simple wisdom of the local people. Born a Jew, he became a Catholic and found the authentic community he sought in Greek Orthodox fishermen and sponge divers.</p><p>In his early life, as he alternated working at <i>The New Yorker</i>, writing screenplays in Hollywood and editing a Paris literary journal with studying philosophy, serving the poor in Harlem and living in a sanctuary high in the French Alps, Lax pursued an approach to life he called pure act&#x2015;a way of living in the moment that was both spontaneous and practiced, God-inspired and self-chosen. By devoting himself to simplicity, poverty and prayer, he expanded his capacity for peace, joy and love while producing distinctive poetry of such stark beauty critics called him &#x201c;one of America&#x2019;s greatest experimental poets&#x201d; and &#x201c;one of the new &#x2018;saints&#x2019; of the avant-garde.&#x201d;</p><p>Written by a writer who met Lax in Greece when he was a young seeker himself and visited him regularly over fifteen years, <i>Pure Act</i> is an intimate look at an extraordinary but little-known life.

He was never seen again. Sapphire knows the legend well. Her father disappeared at sea, and now her brother, Conor, keeps vanishing by the shore, too. Sapphy also feels the inexorable lure of the ocean, a temptation that reveals the truth of the legend and opens a beautiful world beneath the waves: the enchanted, undersea realm known as Ingo. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But there&#x2019;s a dark and dangerous side to Ingo, and Sapphy must face its power or lose touch with everything&#x2015;and everyone&#x2015;she loves on land.</p></p><p><p>HELEN DUNMORE is a novelist, short story writer and poet.

Her poetry collections have won the Poetry Society&#x2019;s Alice Hunt Bartlett Prize and the Signal Poetry Award. Helen Dunmore was born in Yorkshire, England, and now lives in Bristol with her husband and children.</p>Grade 5-9&#x2013;A family living on the coast of Cornwall gets caught up in the undersea kingdom of the Mer people. After their father mysteriously disappears, Sapphy and her brother, Conor, visit Ingo and find themselves yearning to return to the ocean world. Conor resists, but Sapphy has a stronger affinity with the watery kingdom. While she struggles with its temptation, she also clashes with her mother, who seems too ready to forget the children's father. These elements come together in an exciting climax in which the siblings risk traveling to Ingo to save the life of the human diver their mother is dating. Sapphy's present-tense narration brings readers right into her world. Through her eyes, they see the beauty of Ingo, the comfort of her earthbound home, and the confusing muddle of thoughts and emotions that her experiences inspire. The undersea world seems equal parts menacing and alluring, which builds suspense and keeps everything pleasingly unpredictable. Relationships are especially well drawn. Sapphy is dedicated to Conor, despite some jealousy; she loves her mother, though she's keenly aware of how different they are; and she is not sure how to feel about Faro, the charming, sometimes angry young Mer man who serves as her undersea guide. Strong character development combines with an engaging plot and magical elements to make this a fine choice for fantasy readers, who will look forward to the next installments in this planned trilogy.<i>&#x2013;Steven Engelfried, Beaverton City Library, OR</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The eccentric, well-traveled grandmother of two young kids decamps in mid-vacation, riding a porpoise to Greenland and leaving behind a trove of strange treasures and artifacts including a collection of bird&#39;s nests and three old eggs which hatch, marvelously, into passenger pigeons. Erdrich wields her Native American ancestry and her worldiness--Grandmother owns an original Klee--to give young readers a sense of the world&#39;s wonders and the wisdom of the elders, the old wisdom of the natural cycles that we are losing. A letter from Grandmother, promising to return, winds up this fetching tale.Ages 5^-8. Children reside in the world of magic realism, and this offering by adult books author Erdrich will both tantalize them and make them feel utterly at home. An unnamed narrator and her brother delight in their grandmother, who, as it turns out, "is far more mysterious than any of us knew." She disappears on a trip to Greenland--aboard a porpoise's back. When it seems that Grandmother won't be returning, the family reluctantly decides they must clear out her room. Small and cluttered, the room holds everything from a petrified buffalo's tooth to a painting by Paul Klee. But the family is most taken by a bird's nest that holds three small eggs. And then they hatch. To the family's amazement, an ornithologist tells them that the baby pigeons are members of an extinct species that flew in flocks numbering in the millions. Once the news leaks out, the curious descend. The birds grow dull and tired, and the family decides to let them fly free, albeit with a message tied to one's leg. In perhaps the most predictable part of the story, the message is answered by Grandmother, who has finally arrived in Greenland and will be returning home after all. That's the plot, but perhaps what is more important is the book's feeling. Besides the sense of the unexpected that permeates every page is the freshness of the language. The sentence structure is elegant, and since one quality of elegance is simplicity, the writing is never over children's heads. That same spirit is found in the acrylic and colored-pencil artwork that always seems to find its focus in the faces of the children yet mixes everyday bits and pieces with the elusive air of enchantment. Like the pigeons, this is a rare bird--a book that evokes wonder, in both its meanings. <i>Ilene Cooper</i></p><h2>Time Storms</h2><p>This work explores the evidence that holes in time may occur on a regular basis as a result of a strange phenomenon - the time storm. It features reports of people who were actually transported across time and space and examines what time storms are, what causes them and what their effects are. The book also investigates time travel and time machines, evidence that suggests that alien abductions are really time storms, the links between near death experiences and time storms, and whether UFO&#39;s may in fact be time travellers from our own future.</p><p></p><h2>Stand Up Straight and Sing!</h2><p><b>One of America's most admired and decorated artists tells her amazing story, from her childhood in the South to the world's greatest stages.</b><br><br>Jessye Norman is not only one of the world's most admired and beloved singers, she is an American icon whose life story is as moving and dramatic as the great operatic roles she has performed on stage.<br><br>Born and raised in Augusta, Georgia, nurtured in a close family and tight-knit community centered around the church, she studied the piano and sang the songs of her childhood, not dreaming that this passion for music might lead to her life's profession.<br><br>In <i>Stand Up Straight and Sing!</i>, Jessye Norman recalls in rich detail the strong women who were her role models, from her ancestors to family friends, relatives, and teachers.

The author will allow the Word of God to guide the reader in the quest to grasp the enormity and significance of this man and his story. The author&#39;s dictionary defines grit as &#34;firmness of mind or spirit...unyielding courage in the face of hardship or danger.&#34; Tough, tenacious, and fiercely relentless in his determination, Paul pursued his divine mission with unflinching resolve. The man modeled grit like no other mentioned in the scriptures. But his message and his style were also marked by grace. He understood and explained grace better than any of his contemporaries.

They're a bit makeshift but very human and, finally, offer a likable portrait of an interesting, complex survivor. For those who haven't heard from Bacall since her 1979 autobiography By Myself, she's a bit lonely. She's married off her children, and they all have a pretty good relationship, even though everyone has had ups and downs. She's trying to sell her house in Amagansett, N.Y., because she's not there enough, what with trips to London and Paris. She's ``traveling solo'': no men on the horizon, though at this point she feels she could align herself with Mr. Right. But is he ever hard to find! If the truth be told, there's never been anyone to match Bogie (and this, Bacall says, is the right spelling). In fact, these days she's practically channeling him (``the core of Bogie resides in me''). It's hard to get work even for a legend, and work is what has always defined her. So she's feeling a little tender and wondering what the future holds in store and after all, no one said life was easy. She emerges, even with a mantel full of little Henry Moores and memories of an amazing list of friends (Lenny Bernstein, Spence Tracy, Larry and Vivien, etc.), like an American woman approaching 70. She's a classy Jewish mother who tries to remain nonjudgmental as her only daughter, Leslie, is married by a Tibetan priest. And Bogie's baby is a grandma (she doesn't babysit). In describing how she took Leslie to the L.A. house on Mapleton Drive that she shared with Bogart and their two young children, she tries hard to show us that they were not just celluloid myths--they were real. Bacall's reminiscences of famous people are a little too dutiful. (Where is her famous sense of humor?) But her documentation of getting older, like Hepburn's, is real and recognizable to the aging rest of us.

All rights reserved.</i>It's been 15 years since Bacall wrote By Myself, a rich, if necessarily incomplete, autobiography that contained immensely touching accounts of the life of her husband, Humphrey Bogart, and of his painful death in 1957. In her new memoir, she makes it clear that she still judges people and life by Bogart's standards-high ones. Her narrative is fragmentary, almost breathless, but full of raw personality and almost clumsy directness. Two topics weave in and out of the staccato story: motherhood and acting. Bacall's accounts of her theatrical triumphs (Cactus Flower, Applause) and failures (Franklin Street, Good-bye Charlie) are more engaging than her reports of the deep concern she has for her three children (a son and daughter from her marriage with Bogart, and the youngest, the son of Jason Robards). She tends to share details only a mother needs to know. But her dedication to acting-and she means the stage, not the screen-is engrossing: "Acting requires boldness," she tells us. "Laying your life on the line eight times a week is not for the meek and mild." Bacall is certainly not meek. She is brave enough to present her life without excuses.

While walking through his own home, a former Church of England rectory built in the 19th century, Bryson reconstructs the fascinating history of the household, room by room. With waggish humor and a knack for unearthing the extraordinary stories behind the seemingly commonplace, he examines how everyday items--things like ice, cookbooks, glass windows, and salt and pepper--transformed the way people lived, and how houses evolved around these new commodities. "Houses are really quite odd things," Bryson writes, and, luckily for us, he is a writer who thrives on oddities. He gracefully draws connections between an eclectic array of events that have affected home life, covering everything from the relationship between cholera outbreaks and modern landscaping, to toxic makeup, highly flammable hoopskirts, and other unexpected hazards of fashion. Fans of Bryson's travel writing will find plenty to love here; his keen eye for detail and delightfully wry wit emerge in the most unlikely places, making <i>At Home</i> an engrossing journey through history, without ever leaving the house. <em>--Lynette Mong</em><br> <br>BILL BRYSON's books include <b>A Walk in the Woods</b>, <b>I'm a Stranger Here Myself</b>, <b>In a Sunburned Country</b>, <b>Bryson's Dictionary of Troublesome Words</b>, <b>A Short History of Nearly Everything</b>, <b>The Life and Times of the Thunderbolt Kid</b> and <b>Bryson's Dictionary for Writers and Editors</b>.

She struggled to wake her up, pushing and pulling until she managed to tug her mother's lifeless corpse onto her own small body, crushing her beneath its dead weight. After squeezing out from under her mother, Cupcake calmly walked over to the phone and called her aunt Lori. "Lori, my momma's dead." <br><br>Here is the threshold of a hell for young Cupcake. Rather than being allowed to live with the man she believed to be her father--who turns out to have been her stepfather--she is forced into a foster home where the kids were terrorized, the refrigerator padlocked, and Cupcake sexually abused. She eventually fled the house, only to find herself wandering from misadventure to misadventure in the "system," while also developing a massive appetite for drugs and alcohol, an appetite she paid for by turning tricks. She settled down in Los Angeles and found a home in the Crips, where she was taken in and befriended by gangsters like the legendary "Monster" Kody Scott. For the first time she found a family, but when Cupcake was blasted in the back with a 12-gauge shotgun, she was once more taken in by the system. <br><br>At 16, her stepfather reeneters her life and engineers an "emancipation," in which the courts declare her an adult and free her, finally, from the child welfare system. Cup takes advantage of her new freedom to start a drug-dealing operation with her stepfather, who also manages a stable of colorful prostitutes. Soon she meets a man, falls in love, and gets married. He convinces her to get a real job and learn to speak proper English--but he also abuses her and introduces her to crack cocaine. Cupcake flits from job to job, miraculously, given that she never fails to show up without some cocktail of narcotics floating in her system. <br><br>She hits rock bottom when, in desperation, she steals crack from her drug dealer. He beats her nearly to death, rapes her, and then leaves her body behind a dumpster. Cupcake wakes up days later, not sure of how she ended up in this state and from that moment begins to turn her life around. She was adopted by a lawyer who ran the law firm where she "worked," and slowly he assisted her in kicking the habit--with the help of an eccentric group of fellow addicts who became, at last, a family to her--and catching up on her education. With the support of her new family, she eventurally goes all the way to law school (although not without a few additional misadventures along the way) and joins one of the top law firms in the country.<br><br>Cupcake's story is an inspiring, at times hilarious, often distrubing, and deeply moving account of a singular woman who took on the worst of contemporary urban life and survived it with wit and a ferocious will. It updates classic memoirs like <i>I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings</i> and <i>Makes Me Wanna Holler</i>, and gives a bold and gritty spin to contemporary memoirs like <i>Finding Fish</i>. At the center of it, Cupcake is a charming and inspiring narrator through the inferno of her life.</p><p>Cupcake Brown is an attorney at Bingham McCutcheon, one of the largest law firms in California.1 <br><br>The booming music coming from Momma&#x2019;s radio alarm clock suddenly woke me. I could hear Elton John singing about Philadelphia freedom.<br><br> I wonder why Momma didn&#x2019;t wake me? I thought to myself.<br><br> It was January 1976. Wasn&#x2019;t no school that day. But Momma still had to go to work. So, while Momma was at work, I was goin&#x2019; over to Daddy&#x2019;s house to play with Kelly, the daughter of his lady friend.<br><br> I wonder why she didn&#x2019;t wake me? I thought again to myself as I climbed out of bed.<br><br> When I passed the dresser I caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror. Boy, was I ugly.<br><br> &#x201c;Skinny, black, and ugly.&#x201d; That&#x2019;s what the kids at school called me. Or they&#x2019;d yell out, &#x201c;Vette, Vette, looks just like my pet!&#x201d;<br><br> My name was La&#x2019;Vette, but my first birth name was Cupcake. At least that&#x2019;s what my momma told me. Seems Momma craved cupcakes when she was pregnant with me. She had three cupcakes a day, every day, without fail, for nine and a half months (I was two weeks overdue). Momma said that even if she didn&#x2019;t eat anything else, she&#x2019;d have her daily dose of cupcakes.<br><br> Anyway, seems that while &#x201c;we&#x201d; were in labor, the hospital gave Momma some pain drugs. Once Momma popped me out, the nurse said:<br><br> &#x201c;Pat&#x201d;&#x2014;that was my momma&#x2019;s name&#x2014;&#x201c;you have a little girl. Do you know what you want to name her?&#x201d;<br><br> Tired and exhausted from eight hours of hard labor, Momma lifted her head, smiled sheepishly, and said, &#x201c;Cupcake,&#x201d; before she passed out.<br><br> So that&#x2019;s what they put down on my birth certificate. I mean, that is what she said. (The nurses thought it was due to the excitement of motherhood, Momma said it was the drugs). A few hours later, however, when Daddy came to the hospital he decided he didn&#x2019;t like &#x201c;Cupcake.&#x201d; Momma said Daddy wanted to name me La&#x2019;Vette. So, just to make Daddy happy, Momma said she had the hospital change my name. I didn&#x2019;t mind, really. I loved my daddy; so as far as I was concerned, he could change my name to whatever he wanted. But, Momma said that to her I would always be Cupcake. She never called me anything else, &#x2019;cept sometimes she called me &#x201c;Cup&#x201d; for short.<br><br> Anyway, the kids at school always told me that I was ugly. They teased me, saying I looked like &#x201c;Aunt Esther,&#x201d; that old lady from Sanford and Son, the one always calling Sanford a &#x201c;fish-eyed fool.&#x201d; She was the ugliest woman I&#x2019;d ever seen. So if the other kids thought I looked like her, I knew I had to be ugly. Besides, everybody knew a black girl wasn&#x2019;t considered pretty unless she was light-skinned with long straight hair. I was dark-skinned with short kinky hair. I hated my complexion. I hated my hair. I hated my skinny legs and arms.<br><br> But, my momma thought I was beautiful. She&#x2019;d say:<br><br> &#x201c;Cup, you&#x2019;re only eleven years old. You will appreciate your beauty as you grow up.&#x201d;<br><br> Shoot, I couldn&#x2019;t wait to grow up!<br><br> Momma always said things to make me feel better. I loved my momma. She was my best friend and she was beautiful: she had cocoa-colored skin and her long black hair hung way past her shoulders. And, Momma had the biggest, prettiest smile you ever saw. People always told her that she looked like Diana Ross because of her long hair and wide beautiful smile&#x2014;all teeth.<br><br> I passed the black ugly thing in the mirror and continued toward Momma&#x2019;s room. The radio alarm continued to blast. I giggled to myself. Momma was like me. She hated getting up in the morning, so she put the clock way across the room and turned it all the way up so it would scare her awake in the morning. That way, she&#x2019;d have to get out of bed and walk across the room to turn it off.<br><br> I wonder why she didn&#x2019;t turn the alarm off? I thought as I made my way through the kitchen toward the large living room that led into Momma&#x2019;s room. The floor was cold because wasn&#x2019;t no carpet in our house. Still, I loved our old house. It was Victorian style, three bedrooms and one bathroom.<br><br> We lived in San Diego in the heart of the ghetto, though I never knew it until I got older. We had our share of dilapidated houses, and run-down apartment buildings, but most of the houses and apartments in the neighborhood were in decent order. I mean, we didn&#x2019;t have any mansions, but most folks made sincere efforts to keep their houses decent-looking: they watered their tired brown lawns, trying to keep them up (as kept up as a lawn could be with kids runnin&#x2019; over it all the time), and tried to replace windows that had been broken from runaway fly balls that escaped the imaginary fields of street baseball games.<br><br> We had a great neighborhood store, Sawaya Brothers, that had everything you could need or want, including the most delicious pickled pig feet. We had a neighborhood park, Memorial Park, a boys&#x2019; club and a girls&#x2019; club.<br><br> I thought my family was rich because I was the only kid in the neighborhood who had her own bedroom, furnished with a white princess-style bedroom set complete with a canopy bed, matching nightstands, and dresser. There was a pink frilly comforter with matching frills for the canopy overhead. And, I had a closet full of clothes. Unlike other kids in my neighborhood, I never had to share clothes or wear hand-me-downs. Momma loved to sew and made most of my clothes.<br><br> The other kids thought we were rich too. Little did we know that we weren&#x2019;t rich&#x2014;it&#x2019;s just that both my mom and dad worked while the other kids only had one parent trying to raise several kids either on one income or, more commonly, on welfare, though being on welfare wasn&#x2019;t nothing to be &#x2019;shamed about. Most everybody was. In fact, I envied my friends on welfare because they got government food that you couldn&#x2019;t get from the store, like this great government cheese. You ain&#x2019;t had a grilled cheese sandwich till you&#x2019;ve had one made with government cheese.<br><br> The blasting radio brought me back to my immediate mission: finding out why Momma didn&#x2019;t wake me.<br><br> I wished she&#x2019;da woke me up, I thought as I followed the sound of the blasting radio. I was excited about going to my daddy&#x2019;s.<br><br> My momma and daddy didn&#x2019;t live together. Daddy lived around the way with my brother, Larry. I hated Larry. Larry was thin and lanky like me. And he was dark-skinned like me. Although he was two years older than me, he never acted like a big brother. He never protected me. In fact, HE was usually the one I had to be protected FROM. And, usually, it was ME jumping in a fight to protect HIM. I thought he was a wimp.<br><br> Larry hated me just as much as I hated him, but for different reasons. He was jealous of me. He&#x2019;d never admit it, but I knew he was. I was the one who always got good grades and saved my weekly allowance so I could buy something nice and big, while Larry hated school (and was always on the verge of flunking out) and spent his money faster than he got it&#x2014;and then had the nerve to get mad when he didn&#x2019;t have anything left.<br><br> Our hate for each other resulted in fierce fights: cussin&#x2019; each other out (a skill I&#x2019;d turned into an art from an early age) and throwing knives and hammers (or anything else lethal we could find) at each other. Our fights were no joke. We were trying to kill each other for real, or at least cause loss of body parts. In our house, before Larry went to live with Daddy, I could never slack up and always had to watch my back because we were always trying to sabotage each other.<br><br> Once I woke to Larry trying to smother me with a pillow. Bastard. He just woke up one day and decided he&#x2019;d try to kill me. I had to fight, kick, scratch, punch, and scream to get him off me. I got him back, though: I tried to poi- son him.<br><br> Larry was always trying to boss me around. One day, after yet another unsuccessful attempt at killing me, he&#x2019;d ordered me to get him some Kool-Aid. And I did&#x2014;with a little rat poison in it. But watching my sudden obedience, he got suspicious. Talkin&#x2019; &#x2019;bout he smelled &#x201c;somethin&#x2019; funny.&#x201d; He ordered me to take a drink first. I took a sip, but I didn&#x2019;t swallow. I just held it in my mouth, hoping he&#x2019;d now be willing to drink. He was smarter than I thought. He fucked around and fucked around twirling the Kool-Aid in the glass with a sly grin on his face till I couldn&#x2019;t hold what was in my mouth anymore without swallowing.<br><br> Oh shit!

On a freezlng day in December, another child goes missing: thirteen-year-old Alison Carter vanishes from her town, an insular community that distrusts the outside world. For the young George Bennett, a newly promoted inspector, it is the beginning of his most difficult and harrowing case: a murder with no body, an investigation with more dead ends and closed faces than he'd have found in the anonymity of the inner city, and an outcome which reverberates through the years. <br><br>Decades later he finally tells his story to journalist Catherine Heathcote, but just when the book is poised for publication, Bennett unaccountably tries to pull the plug. He has new information which he refuses to divulge, new information that threatens the very foundations of his existence. Catherine is forced to re-investigate the past, with results that turn the world upside down. <br><br>A Greek tragedy in modern England, A Place of Execution is a taut psychological thriller that explores, exposes and explodes the border between reality and illusion in a multi-layered narrative that turns expectations on their head and reminds us that what we know is what we do not know. &nbsp;<i>A Place of Execution</i> is winner of the 2000 <i>Los Angeles Times</i> Book Prize and a 2001 Edgar Award Nominee for Best Novel.</p><p><b>Penzler Pick, August 2000:</b> Val McDermid, better known in England than in the U.S., is a well respected writer of crime fiction. Her three ongoing mystery series feature red-haired PI Kate Brannigan; Lindsay Gordon, a lesbian socialist journalist, and Tony Hill and Carol Jordan, clinical psychologist and detective inspector respectively. <i>A Place of Execution</i> is McDermid's first stand-alone mystery, and with it, she redefines the term "village mystery." <p> It is 1963, the Beatles are becoming wildly popular in England, and the Swinging Sixties are about to change the post-war Western world. But in the village of Scardale in the Peaks District of Derbyshire, a desolate area beloved of hikers and climbers, nothing has changed for hundreds of years. The village has remained small and insular--most villagers are related, and the most common second names are Carter and Lomas. When Alison Carter, aged 13, disappears while walking her dog, the case is given to a young detective inspector named George Bennett. As Bennett gets to know the families in the village and their concerns, he realizes that this case is not as simple as it first seems. The villagers seem to be closing ranks, and Bennett suspects they may be protecting one of their own. Central to his investigation are Alison's mother and her husband. When Ruth Carter remarried, she chose Philip Hawkin, an outsider who is now the current squire of the village. As Alison's stepfather, he raises all kinds of red flags for Bennett. But so does Alison's close relationship with her cousin Charlie who, too conveniently, it seems, finds a vital clue.</p><p> All this is complicated by the fact that the police and the villagers cannot find Alison's body; there are also other disappearances in the area which may or may not be connected. To reveal more about this riveting mystery would be to give too much away. McDermid takes the reader through a maze of conflicting facts and theories, and when Bennett, with the help of local police, solves the case, the real story is only just beginning--especially for Bennett, who will question not only his own part in solving this case, but ultimately the profession he has chosen. <i>--Otto Penzler</i></p>Val McDermid lives in Great Britain.<br></p><h2>Art and Intimacy: How the Arts Began</h2><p>To Ellen Dissanayake, the arts are biologically evolved propensities of human nature: their fundamental features helped early humans adapt to their environment and reproduce themselves successfully over generations. In Art and Intimacy she argues for the joint evolutionary origin of art and intimacy, what we commonly call love.<p>It all begins with the human trait of birthing immature and helpless infants. To ensure that mothers find their demanding babies worth caring for, humans evolved to be lovable and to attune themselves to others from the moment of birth. The ways in which mother and infant respond to each other are rhythmically patterned vocalizations and exaggerated face and body movements that Dissanayake calls rhythms and sensory modes. </p><p>Rhythms and modes also give rise to the arts. Because humans are born predisposed to respond to and use rhythmic-modal signals, societies everywhere have elaborated them further as music, mime, dance, and display, in rituals which instill and reinforce valued cultural beliefs. Just as rhythms and modes coordinate and unify the mother-infant pair, in ceremonies they coordinate and unify members of a group. </p><p>Today we humans live in environments very different from those of our ancestors. They used ceremonies (the arts) to address matters of serious concern, such as health, prosperity, and fecundity, that affected their survival. Now we tend to dismiss the arts, to see them as superfluous, only for an elite. But if we are biologically predisposed to participate in artlike behavior, then we actually need the arts. Even -- or perhaps especially -- in our fast-paced, sophisticated modern lives, the arts encourage us to show that we care about important things.</p><p><b>Ellen Dissanayake</b> is Visiting Scholar at the University of Washington and has recently held Distinguished Visiting Professorships in the College of Fine Arts at the University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada, and at Ball State University, Muncie, Indiana.

She has lectured and taught in a variety of settings, including the New School for Social Research in New York City, the National Arts School in Papua New Guinea, and the University of Edinburgh in Scotland. She is the author of Homo Aestheticus: Where Art Comes From and What Is Art For?The latest from Dissanayake (Homo Aestheticus; What Is Art For?) pursues two grand and simultaneous goals: the first is to show that aesthetic experience in all its variety (viewing paintings, playing concerti, observing sunsets, etc.) shares basic features with experiences we call "love"--whether parental, fraternal or romantic. The second is to place these features within a theory of natural selection as it worked on primates and early hominids. For Dissanayake, love and art minister to a "hierarchy of needs" that recall the terminology of mid-century psychology. The first term of the hierarchy ("mutuality") has its prototype in the bond between parent and infant; the last ("elaborating") explains why we sometimes want art for art's sake. The superb first chapter synthesizes studies of mother-infant bonding in people, chimps and apes, and rebukes other "evolutionary psychologists" who attend to how babies get made, but not to what happens after they're born. "Elaborating" in premodern societies, Dissanayake contends, took place most often through communal ceremonies; today, we find this sort of satisfaction primarily in sex or in works of art--one reason why society, and government, ought to be "taking the arts seriously." Provocative if not always convincing, Dissanayake knows she hasn't produced a fully fledged philosophical aesthetics and avoids the strident determinisms that often afflict "evolutionary psychology." The weakest parts of her book trail off into cultural jeremiads: video games are (surprise!) bad, handicrafts good. But the strongest elements bring welcome information from the social and natural sciences to readers who think, or want to think, about art in general.

Now, with <i>The Three Golden Keys</i>, he gives us his most heartfelt and autobiographical work to date: the reworking of three classic Czechoslovakian fairy tales into a haunting illustrated fable of his lost childhood in Prague that is also a deeply felt allegory of the reclamation of a Czech cultural identity after forty-five years of Communist rule. A man returns to his home in the ancient city of his childhood. Three large rusty locks bar his entry. He knows he must somehow find the three golden keys that will let him in. Suddenly a black cat leaps off the gate; seeming to invite him to follow. Together they search through Prague's monuments and landmarks. With each key they find, a different aspect of the city comes to life and recounts for them a classic Czech fairy tale. The man runs back to his childhood home and excitedly opens the three rusty locks. Inside the front door, back turned to him, is his mother. She glances up, and as she recognizes him and comes to life, so does the city. Utterly magical on every level, <i>The Three Golden Keys</i> is destined to become a classic of children's literature. It truly is a "book for children of all ages."</p><p>Peter Sis was born in Brno, Czechoslovakia, and studied painting and filmmaking at the Academy of Applied Arts in Prague, and at the Royal College of Art in London. He has written and illustrated many award-winning books for children, including the Caldecott Honor-winning <i>Starry Messenger: Galileo Galilei </i>and <i>Tibet Through the Red Box</i>. He lives in Paris, France and New York City.<br>Grade 2-4-When a storm blows a man's hot-air balloon off-course, he lands in a city where everything recalls his childhood in Prague. He finds the family house but it is locked with three rusty padlocks. He follows the family cat through the empty streets to the library, the Emperor's garden, and the famous town-square clock. In each place, figures from the past emerge from the walls and unroll a scroll that holds a key and relates the traditional Czech legends of Prince Bruncvik and his magic sword, the Golem, and Hanus the clockmaker. With the three keys in hand, he returns home where he recollects voices, sounds, and pictures. From the foreword to his daughter to the first-person voice, Sis has created a personal journey that is multilayered with images, memories, and symbols. The art itself is layered with felines, faces, and ghostly figures imposed over backgrounds, camouflaged in streets and structures, and emerging from misty reflections. With tiny, delicate lines and meshlike textures, the artist's distinctive style is evocative. The scroll stories are handscripted in numbered sequences with a pictogram bordering the two-page spreads. The tiny handwriting is so intricate it requires close focus. Overall the book is intriguing, with visual and textual subtleties interconnecting with cultural and historical ties. Older picture book readers should appreciate the beauty of the illustrations and the symbolism.<br><i>Julie Cummins, New York Public Library</i><br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Winter Guest</h2><p><p>A stirring novel of first love in a time of war and the unbearable choices that could tear sisters apart, from the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>The Orphan's Tale</i></p><p></p><p>Life is a constant struggle for the eighteen-year-old Nowak twins as they raise their three younger siblings in rural Poland under the shadow of the Nazi occupation. The constant threat of arrest has made everyone in their village a spy, and turned neighbor against neighbor.

She had been dreaming of <em>makowiec,</em> the poppy seed rolls Mama used to make, thick and warm with a dusting of sugar. So when the noise grew louder, intruding on her dream and causing her hands to tremble, she clung tighter to the bread, drawing it hurriedly to her mouth. But before she could take a bite, a crash rattled the house and a dish in the kitchen fell and shattered.<br><br>She sat bolt upright, trying to see through the darkness. "Ruth!" Helena shook her sister. Ruth, who was curled up in a warm ball with her arms wrapped around the three slumbering children between them, had always slept more soundly. "Bombs!" Immediately awake, Ruth leaped up and grabbed one of their younger sisters under each arm. Helena followed, tugging a groggy Michal by the hand, and they raced toward the cellar as they had rehearsed dozens of times, not bothering to stop for the shoes lined up at the foot of the bed.<br><br>Helena scrambled down the ladder first, followed by Michal. Then Ruth passed five-year-old Dorie below before climbing down herself, the baby wrapped around her neck. Helena dropped to the ground and pulled Dorie onto her lap, smelling the sour milk on the child's breath. She cringed as the inevitable wetness of the muddy earth seeped through her nightclothes, then braced herself for the next explosion. She recalled the horrors she'd heard of the Warsaw bombings and hoped that the cottage could withstand it.<br><br>"Is it a storm?" Dorie asked, her voice hushed with apprehension.<br><br><em>"Nie, kochana."</em> The child's body relaxed palpably in Helena's arms. Dorie could not imagine something worse than a storm. If only it were that simple.<br><br>Beside her, Ruth trembled. <em>"Jestes pewna?" Are you certain there were bombs?</em><br><br>Helena nodded, then realized Ruth could not see her. <em>"Tak."</em> Ruth would not second-guess her. The sisters trusted each other implicitly and Ruth deferred to her where their safety was concerned. Michal leaned his tangle of curls against her shoulder and she hugged him tightly, feeling his ribs protrude beneath his skin. Twelve years old, he seemed to grow taller every day and their meager rations simply couldn't keep up.<br><br>Ten minutes passed, then twenty, without further noise. "I guess it's over," Helena said, feeling foolish. "Not bombs, then."<br><br>Helena could sense her sister's lips curling in the darkness. "No." She waited for Ruth's rebuke for having dragged them needlessly from bed. When it did not come, Helena stood and helped Dorie up the ladder. Together they all climbed back into the bed that had once belonged to their parents.<br><br>Helena thought of the noises early the next morning as she made her way up the tree-covered hill that rose before their house. The early-December air was crisp, the sky heavy with foreboding of the harsher weather that would soon come. It had not been her imagination&#x2014;she was sure of that. She had heard the drone of the airplane flying too low and the sound that followed had been an explosion. But she could see for miles from this vantage point, and when she peered back over her shoulder, the tiny town and rolling countryside were untouched, the faded rooftops and brown late-autumn brush she had known all her life showing no signs of damage.<br><br>She was halfway up the hill when a rooster crowed. Helena smiled smugly, as though she had outplayed the animal at its own game. Pausing, she turned and scanned the horizon again, gazing out at the rolling Malopolska hills. Beyond them to the south sat the High Tatras, their snowcapped peaks obscured by mist. She gazed up at the half crescent moon that lingered against the pale early-morning sky. The wind blew then and the moon seemed to duck behind some silvery gray clouds, casting light around the edges.<br><br>Helena bent to untangle the frayed hem of her skirt from the tops of her boots with annoyance. Her eyes dropped once more. Biekowice was just one of a dozen or so villages surrounding the larger town of Myslenice, spokes on a wheel fanning across the countryside. The entire region had been part of the Austrian empire not thirty years earlier and the latticed, red roof houses still gave it a slightly Germanic feel. There was one road into town, feeding into a cluster of streets, which wound claustrophobically around the market square like a noose. Another road led out just as quickly. A patchwork of farms dotted the outskirts, gray smoke wafting from their chimneys to form a halo above.<br><br>Shifting the small satchel she carried, Helena continued along the western path, a pebble-strewn route that climbed upward toward the main road. In the stream that ran alongside the path, water gurgled. Her footsteps fell into an easy rhythm. Despite her mother's admonitions, Helena had escaped to the woods frequently as a child. In the confines of their small cottage, she bounced about restlessly like a rubber ball, with nowhere for her energy to go. But this was the one place she could be by herself and truly feel free.<br><br>Pine needles crackled beneath her feet, breaking the stillness, their scent mixing with more than a hint of smoke. What brush or refuse could the farmers be burning now? Everything, even items once discarded, might have some use. Leaves and twigs could, if not fuel a fire, at least make it burn longer, stretch the logs or make them hotter when the wood in the pile was damp. She scoured the ground now as she walked, looking for dropped berries or nuts or even acorns that might be used for tea. But the earth here was picked bare by the animals, as ravenous and desperate as she.<br><br>The war had broken out more than fifteen months earlier, and for a while, despite the warnings that crackled nonstop across the radio, first in Polish and later in German, it seemed as though it might not have happened at all. Though their small village was less than twenty kilometers from Krakow, little had changed other than the occasional passing of military trucks on the high road outside town. It was the blessing, Helena reflected, of living in a place so sleepy as to be of no strategic value. But the hardships had come, if not the Germans themselves: herds of cattle and other livestock disappeared in the night, reportedly over the western border. Coal stores were requisitioned and sent to the front to help the war effort. And an unusually cruel summer drought had contributed to the misery, leaving little to be canned for winter storage.<br><br>She reached the paved road that led toward the city. It was deserted now, but exhaust hung freshly in the air, suggesting a car or wagon had passed recently. Helena's skin prickled. She could not afford to encounter anyone now. She looked longingly back toward the trees, but taking the steep, winding forest path would only slow her down.<br><br>As she started forward, Helena's thoughts turned to the previous evening. "Don't go," Ruth had begged as they readied the children for bed. They'd worked seamlessly in tandem as they'd completed the familiar grooming chores, like two appendages of the same body. "It's dangerous." She accidentally pulled Dorie's braid too hard, causing her to squeal.<br><br>Ruth's objection was familiar. She had fought Helena since she'd first proposed going to the city, continuing Tata's weekly pilgrimage after his death. It was not so much that the half-day trek was physically demanding; Helena had navigated the steep, rocky countryside with her father all her life. But the Nazis had forbidden Poles from traveling beyond the borders of their own provinces without work passes. If they noticed Helena and asked questions, she could be arrested.<br><br>"What other choice do we have?" Helena had asked practically, pulling the nightdress over Karolina's hair, savoring her freshly washed smell. They did baths twice a week, Karolina first, then the older children and Ruth and finally Helena, scrubbing as well as she could in the cool, filmy water after the rest had gone to bed. "We have to make sure Mama eats." And is not mistreated, she added silently. The care at the sanatorium was minimal, the resources scarce. She hadn't told Ruth of the times she'd turned up to find their mother missing her socks or lying in her own excrement, risking infection of the bedsores she persistently developed from not being turned.<br><br>Ruth had not answered, but continued unbraiding Dorie's hair, lips pursed in conflict. Helena knew that Ruth found the notion of Mama shut away in some city hospital alone unbearable, and that Helena checking on her each week gave her some comfort. Ruth feared the outside world, though. She had responded to everything that had happened by closing off and drawing within.<br><br>Helena, on the other hand, wanted to see the world. Her mind reeled back to an earlier trip to the city. It was a fine fall day, some leaves still orange on the trees, others giving a satisfying crunch beneath her feet. She had passed the turnoff for the city and it was a good two kilometers down the road before she realized she was on the path that would lead away from Biekowice for good. Ruth's face had flashed in her mind then and Helena had stopped, guilt-stricken. She had been distracted, she told herself, and accidentally missed the turn. But she knew it was something more&#x2014;for a moment she was actually leaving, without looking back. She had not taken that path again, but each trip she stopped and looked longingly down the road, wondering how far she could actually go.<br><br>Helena was jolted from her thoughts by a loud noise, a giant's foot crunching down on a house. Ahead, a German jeep, machine gun mounted on the front, blocked the roadway. Helena leaped back into the roadside brush, catching her hand on something jagged. She stifled a cry as a thorn cut through her worn glove and into her skin.<br><br>As blood seeped through the wool, Helena berated herself silently for her carelessness in not clinging to the cover of the trees that lined the road. She crouched low to the ground, not daring to breathe. But it was too late: the gun mounted atop the jeep turned toward her with a creak. A soldier stood behind it, his gaze seeming to focus just above her. He shielded his eyes, searching the forest. This was the closest Helena had come to the war and, despite her terror, she found herself studying the man. He was ruddy faced and ordinary; save for the uniform and gun, he might have been one of the loggers down at the mill.<br><br>The soldier's eyes narrowed, a mountain wolf hunting its prey. A hand seemed to grip Helena's throat, squeezing. Would he arrest her or shoot her here? She was suddenly desperate to be in the house that an hour ago she had so eagerly escaped.<br><br>Her heart pounded as she imagined her death. Ruth would be sad, or maybe cross. "I told you so," her twin might say if she were here now, a smug smile playing about her full lips. Ruth liked to be right more than just about anything and Helena seemed to always give her reason by spilling or breaking something. Helena pictured Michal, wise beyond his years, comforting his sisters. But the little ones were closer to Ruth, depended on her for their care. And they had been so battered by the loss of their parents that they might weather this additional blow without much grief.<br><br>Helena felt against her side the cool metal of the knife she'd taken from Tata's hunting kit and tucked in the waist of her skirt. She carried it in case she encountered a wolf, but now an image seized her of drawing it and slashing the German's throat.<br><br>A minute passed, then another. Finally, the man sat down and started the ignition. As the jeep started in the other direction, Helena slumped against a tree, trying to catch her breath.<br><br>When the sound of the engine had faded, Helena stepped out from the bushes and scanned the now-deserted road. She didn't dare continue this way now. Perhaps Ruth had been right about the danger of the trip and she should return home. But she imagined Mama alone in the hospital and knew that she had no choice. She doubled back to the path where it emerged from the woods. Steeling herself, Helena stepped into the forest and the welcome shelter of the trees that loomed overhead as she started toward the steep pass over the hills.<br><br>At the sound of the door clicking shut, Ruth snapped her eyes open and tightened her arms around the children. She strained without success to see in the darkness, instantly struck by the sense of emptiness beside her. The bed was a bit cooler and the mattress did not sink as heavily as usual. Helena was gone. She had left for the city, this time without nudging Ruth as she usually did. And she had gone earlier, though perhaps that was not so strange, given the shortening days and the need to get back more quickly before nightfall.<br><br>Ruth shifted with effort, weighing the void she always felt in Helena's absence. Michal's head was on her shoulder, Dorie holding to her ankle and Karolina flung across her chest. The children seemed to gravitate toward her instinctively, even while sleeping. They were curled around her like puppies now, sweaty fingers clinging to her arm, cold toes pressing against her side. They had slept like this since their parents had gone, not only for warmth and to comfort the little ones, but also to keep everyone near in case of bombs like the ones Helena thought she had heard the previous night, or God only knew what else. Usually she found comfort in their closeness. But now they seemed cloying and heavy, making each breath an effort.<br><br>Disentangling herself carefully, Ruth donned her housecoat and slippers. She made her way to the kitchen, savoring the easy movements of her now-free limbs. She pulled back the shutters to watch as her sister climbed the hill. Her stomach fluttered anxiously. She had never quite gotten used to Helena's absences. They had always been together, and in some hazy memory she could remember looking up from her mother's breast to see the roundness of her sister's head, eyes locking as they fed. Being without her was an appendage missing.<br><br>"Don't go," she wanted to shout as Helena grew smaller. They had sworn to Mama that they would keep the family together, and each time Helena ventured out to Krakow, risking arrest or worse, they were putting that promise in jeopardy. Her mind cascaded, as it always did, to the worst-case scenario: without Helena, Ruth would not be able to sustain the family and the children would have to be placed in an orphanage, where they would surely remain because no one was taking on extra mouths to feed these days.<br><br>As Helena disappeared, seemingly swallowed by the thick pine trees, Ruth was struck by an unexpected touch of envy. What was it like to just walk away, escape the house and the children and their needs for a few hours? Generally Ruth liked the comfort of their home with all of its memories and had no interest in venturing beyond the front gate. But now she imagined striding through the brisk morning air, arms free and footsteps light. Did Helena ever want to keep going and not come back?<br><br></p><h2>Sir Gawain and the Green Knight: A New Verse Translation</h2><p>A splendid new translation of the classic Arthurian tale of enchantment, adventure, and romance, presented alongside the original Middle English text.<br><br>It is the height of Christmas and New Year&#x2019;s revelry when an enormous knight with brilliant green clothes and skin descends upon King Arthur&#x2019;s court. He presents a sinister challenge: he will endure a blow of the axe to his neck without offering any resistance, but whoever gives the blow must promise to take the same in exactly a year and a day&#x2019;s time. The young Sir Gawain quickly rises to the challenge, and the poem tells of the adventures he finds&#x2014;an almost irresistible seduction, shockingly brutal hunts, and terrifyingly powerful villains&#x2014;as he endeavors to fulfill his promise.<br><br>Capturing the pace, impact, and richly alliterative language of the original text, W. S. Merwin has imparted a new immediacy to a spellbinding narrative, written centuries ago by a poet whose name is now unknown, lost to time. Of the Green Knight, Merwin notes in his foreword: &#x201c;We seem to recognize him&#x2014;his splendor, the awe that surrounds him, his menace and his grace&#x2014;without being able to place him . . . We will never know who the Green Knight is except in our own response to him.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Wonderfully readable...Merwin&#x2019;s decades of experience as a translator and his poetic intuition give him an advantage here. His <i>Gawain</i> is a graceful read and, at the same time, remains as true as possible to the sense and style of the original...These are the kind of nuances that word-worshippers will linger over&#x2013;but not before rushing through the story first to get to the good parts.&#x201d;<br>&#x2013;Sheila Farr, <i>The Seattle Times<br></i><br>&#x201c;Readers who enjoy a well-told story, not lacking in sex and violence but also endowed with a sense of moral purpose, will find a wonderful one here...Merwin&#x2019;s translation has a directness and simplicity that can be quite powerful...<i>Sir Gawain and the Green Knight</i> endures&#x2013;charming, strange, tantalizingly mysterious&#x2013;and Merwin&#x2019;s translation catches at least some of the gleam of its vanished world.&#x201d;<br>&#x2013;Merle Rubin, <i>Los Angeles Times<b><br></b></i><br>"<i>Gawain</i> remains, centuries after it was written, a poem of uncanny power. It has the tapestried richness of legend, but also an astonishing psychological complexity. Its lines are elegantly wrought, but they propel us through an adventure filled with erotic entanglements, dire challenges, and mysterious landscapes. Here is that rare poem with both the epic dimensions of ageless myth and the eerie intimacy of last night's dream. The clarity, ingenuity, and force of W. S. Merwin's translation will enable a new generation of readers to discover a remarkable masterpiece."<br>&#x2013;J. D. McClatchyW. S. Merwin was born in New York City in 1927 and grew up in Union<br>City, New Jersey, and in Scranton, Pennsylvania. From 1949 to 1951 he<br>worked as a tutor in France, Portugal, and Majorca. He has since lived in<br>many parts of the world, most recently on Maui in the Hawaiian Islands.<br>His many books of poems, prose, and translations are listed at the<br>beginning of this volume. He has been the recipient of many awards and<br>prizes, including the Fellowship of the Academy of American Poets (of<br>which he is now a Chancellor), the Pulitzer Prize in Poetry, and the<br>Bollingen Prize in Poetry; most recently he has received the Governor's<br>Award for Literature of the state of Hawaii, the Tanning Prize for mastery in<br>the art of poetry, a Lila Wallace-Reader's Digest Writers' Award, and the<br>Ruth Lilly Poetry Prize.</p><h2>Give Us a King!: Samuel, Saul, and David</h2><p>Everett Fox's translation of the biblical books from Genesis through Deuteronomy has been widely acclaimed as a scholarly, religious, and literary masterpiece. Praising its unique and authoritative approach, the <i>New York Times Book Review</i> said, "It makes it possible for us to take up the Scripture as if we had never seen it before." <br><br>In <b>Give Us a King!</b> Fox turns to the two books of Samuel, which contain some of the Bible's most famous stories and most unforgettable personalities: the barren Hannah, who will be mother to the prophet Samuel; the tragic King Saul; Bathsheba, the object of King David's illicit desire and the future mother of King Solomon; and King David himself, the romantic hero who becomes a legendary but morally compromised monarch. <br><br>Accompanied by illuminating commentary and notes, Fox's masterful translation re-creates the echoes, allusions, alliterations, and wordplays of the Hebrew original, so that the reader is finally able to experience in English the full power of the ancient saga of the original once and future king.</p><p><i>Give Us a King! Samuel, Saul, and David</i> is Everett Fox's new translation of Saul I and II. Fox, whose translation of <i>The Five Books of Moses</i> is by far the best contemporary rendering of Hebrew Scripture, has performed another literary miracle with <i>Give Us a King!</i>. His style presumes that "the reader of the Bible should ideally recite the text aloud, allowing himself or herself to be led by its sound rather than presupposing what is to be found there," as Fox explains in this book's introduction. Consequently, Fox's translation (which appears on the page in the form of free verse, not as prose) preserves the strangeness of the Hebrew text, rather than smoothing it over with English euphemisms and elegant transitions. The style of Fox's translation, one hopes, will bring new readers to consider the perennially urgent matters described by Samuel I and II. According to Fox, the central themes of these stories are personal responsibility and leadership--"a people's struggle with what it means to ask for leadership, how the leaders measure up to the task, and how the ideals of a culture fare in that process." This book might be most productively read along with Robert Alter's very different but equally impressive translation of the same texts, <i>The David Story</i>. <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i><b>The Five Books of Moses</b><br>translated by Everett Fox<br><br>"A binding religious text, a historical document of the first importance, and a work of great literary imagination." <br>-- Edward Hirsch, <i>New York Times Book Review</i><br><br>"Startling. . . . Those who have been looking for an English translation of the Hebrew Bible that will, at last, let them glimpse the vitality of the Hebrew text will treasure this new translation and will wait expectantly for more translations from Everett Fox." &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>-- Edward Mark, <i>Boston Globe</i><br><br>"Fox's translation has the rare virtue of making constantly visible in English the Hebraic quality of the original, challenging preconceptions of what the Bible is really like. It is a bracing protest against the bland modernity of all the recent English versions of the Bible."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>-- Robert Alter, professor of comparative literature, University of California, Berkeley<br><br>"No serious Bible reader--whether Jewish, Christian, or secular--can afford to ignore this volume." -- Jon D.

As in the superb first volume (1986)--which took Keynes (1883-1946) through the immediate aftermath of WW I--Skidelsky (International Studies/University of Warwick) offers a perceptive portrait, one that here reveals a worldly-wise philosopher at the peak of his considerable powers. Focusing on Keynes the innovative, albeit pragmatic, thinker who abandoned any notion that classical economics was a body of knowledge rather than a method of analysis, the author provides accessible perspectives on how the economist involved himself in Whitehall's disastrous decision to return England to the gold standard in 1925; in the mass misery of the Depression; and in other great issues. Stressing his subject's constant efforts to devise an economic system that would tame capitalism's more savage features without unleashing socialism, Skidelsky shows how Keynes achieved international stature sufficient to affect FDR's New Deal and then went on to write a masterwork with remarkable staying power, The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money. In tracing the metamorphosis of Keynes from clever young man to authoritative adult, moreover, the author doesn't scant the public man's private life. Among other insights, he provides a moving account of how Keynes, long a homosexual, astounded Bloomsbury friends by falling in love with and marrying Lydia Lopokova, a Russian ballerina. Covered as well are the ways in which Keynes (who moved easily among venues as varied as academe, the arts, finance, government, and high society) used his market savvy to make himself a wealthy man. (One cavil: Skidelsky devotes too much attention to trivial details--e.g., furniture purchases for the Keynes country home and the given names of a servant's children.) A comprehensive and commanding profile that's bidding fair to become the standard reference. (Sixteen pages of b&amp;w illustrations) -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

As if this weren t enough to deal with, an incredibly cheap, longlasting, and highly addictive drug has rolled into town.</p> <p>Over a period of four years, journalist Nick Reding brings us into the heart of Oelwein through a cast of intimately drawn characters, including: Clay Hallburg, the town doctor, who fights meth even as he struggles with his own alcoholism; Nathan Lein, the town prosecutor, whose caseload is filled almost exclusively with meth-related crime; and Jeff Rohrick, a meth addict, still trying to kick the habit after twenty years. Tracing the connections between the lives touched by the drug and the global forces that set the stage for the epidemic, <i>Methland</i> offers a vital and unique perspective on a pressing contemporary tragedy.</p></p><p>Nick Reding is the author of <i>The Last Cowboys at the End of the World</i>, and his writing has appeared in <i>Outside</i>, <i>Food and Wine</i>, and <i>Harper's</i>. Born in St. Louis, he decided to move back to his hometown in the course of reporting this book.During the 2008 presidential campaign, Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin created a small scandal when she told a North Carolina crowd, "We believe that the best of America is in these small towns that we get to visit, and in these wonderful little pockets of what I call the real America." Apart from whatever political hay the left made of rhetoric elevating small-town Americans over their more urban counterparts, Palin's comments tapped into a central myth of our national culture -- that there is something fundamentally undiluted and authentic about small towns that is implicitly absent from larger cities. Small-town residents, the story goes, are honest, hard-working, religiously observant and somehow just more American than the rest of America. <p>In his persuasive new book, <i>Methland</i>, journalist Nick Reding reveals the fallacies of this myth by showing how, over the past three decades, small-town America has been blighted by methamphetamine, which has taken root in--and taken hold of--its soul. Over four years, Reding studied meth production and addiction in Oelwein, Iowa, a rural community about 300 miles from Chicago. With a population of just over 6,000, Oelwein serves as a case study of the problems many small towns face today. Once a vibrant farming community where union work and small businesses were plentiful, Oelwein is now struggling through a transition to agribusiness and low-wage employment or, alternatively, unemployment. These conditions, Reding shows, have made the town susceptible to methamphetamine.</p> <p>There is no more horrifying example of the drug's ravages than Roland Jarvis, who began using meth as a way to keep up his energy through double shifts at a local meat-processing plant. Apparently doing so was nothing unusual, and until the early 1980's, an Oelwein physician would routinely prescribe methamphetamines for fatigued workers. When the plant where Jarvis worked was de-unionized and his wages slashed by two-thirds, Jarvis went from an occasional meth user to a habitual user and then a manufacturer. One night, in a fit of drug-induced paranoia, he attempted, disastrously, to dispose of his cooking chemicals. In the ensuing fire, he was so horribly burned that paramedics could only watch while the flesh literally melted from his body and Jarvis begged the police to kill him. Reding's description of Jarvis now, using his fingerless hands to lift a meth pipe to his noseless face, is among the most haunting images in the book.</p> <p>Reding tracks the decline--and, ultimately, the limited resurgence--of Oelwein, while also examining the larger forces that have contributed to its problems. He links meth to the gathering power of unregulated capitalism beginning in the 1980's. It was then, he argues, that one-time union employees earning good wages and protected by solid benefits, like Roland Jarvis, began to see their earnings cut and their benefits disappear. Undocumented migrants began taking jobs at extraordinarily low wages, thereby depressing the cost of labor. Meth, with its opportunity for quick profit and its power to make the most abject and despondent person feel suddenly alive and vibrant, found fertile ground. Meanwhile, in Washington, pharmaceutical lobbyists were working hard to keep DEA agents from attempting to limit access to the raw ingredients; ephedrine and pseudoephedrine, meth's core precursors, were simply too vital to the lucrative allergy-remedy market. Though he avoids making the argument in such stark terms, Reding positions the meth epidemic as the triumph of profits over the safety and prosperity of America's small-town inhabitants.</p> <p>But meth hasn't always been seen as a menace. In fact, Reding explains, "methamphetamine was once heralded as the drug that would end the need for all others." First developed by a Japanese chemist at the end of the 19th century, meth was, by the middle of the 20th century, embraced by many in government and industry as a wonder drug perfect for, among other things, keeping up soldier morale. Several governments, including the United States, used it on their troops in World War II, despite studies showing that it produced "psychotic" and "anti-social" behaviors including "increased libido, sexual aggression, violence, hallucinations, dementia, bodily shaking, hyperthermia, sadomasochism, inability to orgasm, Satanic thoughts, general immorality, and chronic insomnia." Nonetheless (and overlooking the vexing question of how it's possible to measure satanic thoughts), meth continued to gain popularity, largely because of its ability to make people "feel good"--and industrious. "It's one thing for a drug to be associated with sloth, like heroin," Reding writes, "but it's wholly another when a formerly legal and accepted narcotic exists in a one-to-one ratio with the defining ideal of American culture."</p> <p>Among the biggest culprits in the spread of the meth epidemic, Reding argues, are the media, which, he says, have gone from obliviousness to obsession to a premature declaration of the end of the meth problem, and finally the pronouncement that there never was a meth problem in the first place. "Meth just wasn't as interesting to report on once it could no longer be cast as a fundamentally American morality play," Reding argues. "In many cases, the postmortem became a witch hunt, as bloggers and newspaper columnists called into question whether the meth epidemic had ever existed in the first place." <i>Methland</i> makes the case that small-town America is perhaps not the moral and hard-working place of the public imagination, but it also argues that big-city ignorance --fueled by the media--toward small-town decay is both dangerous and appalling.

McManus (BA, University of North Carolina; MDiv, Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary) serves as lead pastor and cultural architect of Mosaic, a diverse, multi-ethnic church based in Los Angeles, California. As founder of Awaken, an entrepreneurial community, Erwin collaborates with a team of dreamers and innovators who specialize in the field of developing and unleashing personal and organizational creativity. A national and international consultant on culture, change, leadership, and creativity, he partners with Bethel Theological Seminary as a futurist and distinguished lecturer. He is the author of the ECPA Silver Medallion Award-winning book, An Unstoppable Force, and Seizing Your Divine Moment, Uprising: A Revolution of the Soul, and The Barbarian Way.</p>McManus's collection of essays reads like a series of lively late-night college bull sessions about the meaning of life, with enough transitions and common threads to pull reader-participants along. "We are all on the same quest," he writes. "And our soul craving is to find something we can believe in." McManus wants readers to come to know themselves and meet God on the journey. "This thing that haunts you, that never seems satisfied, the cravings in your soul that you are unable to satiate through all the success that the world can bring&#x2014;this is your soul screaming for God." He spends many pages on love and its implications and emphasizes grace while eschewing legalism and shaming. McManus also muses on ambition, the power of hope, the uniqueness of each person, the search for meaning and purpose, the need for trust, and death and the problem of evil. McManus (<i>The Barbarian Way</i>), the lead pastor of the Mosaic community in Los Angeles, has an unusually un-self-conscious voice. Throughout, he seamlessly incorporates personal anecdotes, music lyrics and movie snippets. Although the content isn't particularly new and the book might have benefited from some tightening, McManus's fresh presentation will do much to woo spiritual seekers and disenchanted Christians to a more authentic Christianity. <i>(Nov. 14)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

There certainly were some things he liked less than others. For example, he wasn&#x2019;t terribly fond of waiting for his latest brew to ferment and mature to the point where he could sample it. That wasn&#x2019;t because he was anxious to know how it tasted. He had that figured out already&#x2014;it would be fantastic. What he liked less about waiting was that it gave him all sorts of time to think of new brews, with new ingredients, and he wanted to dive right in and work on them.<br> <br>But brewing took time and care. With the equipment at the brewery fully involved in the last batch, waiting to develop a new batch was his only option. That meant he had to find something to do by way of distraction, otherwise waiting and planning and brewing things up in his mind would drive him crazy.<br> <br>Out in the world, in the lands of Azeroth, finding distraction had been easy. There was always someone who didn&#x2019;t like you, or a hungry creature that wanted to eat you&#x2014;and discouraging both did wonders to occupy an idle mind. And then there were places that had once been, or were becoming, something else that might be again what they were. On his travels he&#x2019;d seen many of those places and more, and had even helped make some into something.<br> <br>Chen sighed and looked toward the center of the sleepy fishing village. There his niece, Li Li, was entertaining a dozen of Binan Village&#x2019;s cubs&#x2014;most of them residents, some of them refugees. Chen was pretty sure she had intended to tell them stories of her travels on Shen-zin Su, the Great Turtle, but this plan had gone awry. Or maybe she was still telling a story but had enlisted their aid in acting out a scene. Clearly the story of a fight, and one that apparently involved her being swarmed over by a pack of young pandaren.<br> <br>&#x201c;Is everything going well, Li Li?&#x201d;<br> <br>The slender girl somehow surfaced from amid a boiling sea of black and white fur. &#x201c;Perfectly well, Uncle Chen!&#x201d; The frustration in her eyes belied her words. She reached down, plucked one scrawny boy from the pack, and tossed him aside, then disappeared beneath a wave of shrieking cubs.<br> <br>Chen thought to step in but hesitated. Li Li was in no real danger and she was a strong-willed girl. If she needed help, she&#x2019;d ask for it eventually. To intervene before that would make her think he doubted she could take care of herself. She&#x2019;d sulk for a bit, and he just hated when she did that. She&#x2019;d also be outraged and then would go do something to prove she could take care of herself, and that might land her in even greater trouble.<br> <br>Though that was his primary line of reasoning, the whispers and tutting from the two Chiang sisters gave him further cause to hold back. The two of them were old enough to remember when Liu Lang had first departed Pandaria&#x2014;or so they said. Though their fur ran much more to white than black, save where they darkened it around their eyes, Chen assumed they weren&#x2019;t quite that old. They&#x2019;d spent all their lives in Pandaria, and very little of them in the company of those who had lived on the Wandering Isle. They&#x2019;d developed opinions of those who &#x201c;chased the turtle,&#x201d; and Chen had taken a delight in confounding them by acting against type.<br> <br>Li Li, in their eyes, was purely one of the turtle&#x2019;s wild dogs. Impulsive and practical, quick to action and a bit prone to overestimation of her own abilities, Li Li was a fine example of a pandaren accepting the philosophy of Huojin. It was people of such an adventurous spirit who had departed on the turtle or adventured in Outland. Such conduct, in the minds of the Chiang sisters, simply was not to be condoned or given any credit.<br> <br>Nor were those who did such things.<br> <br>Chen, were he of a nature to dislike things, certainly would dislike the Chiang sisters. He&#x2019;d actually taken a liking to them. In addition to fixing up the Stormstout Brewery and concocting fantastic beverages, he&#x2019;d wandered Pandaria to learn more about the place he&#x2019;d determined would be his home. He&#x2019;d seen them, two maiden sisters, struggling with a small garden patch that had gone untended during the yaungol siege, and had offered to help.<br> <br>They&#x2019;d not so much as replied to him, but he&#x2019;d pitched in anyway. He repaired fences and weeded. He laid down new stones for the path to their door. He entertained their great-grandcubs by breathing fire. He swept, hauled water, and piled up firewood. He did that under their disapproving stares and only because, beneath it all, he read disbelief in their eyes.<br> <br>He&#x2019;d worked long and hard without their speaking a word to him before he first heard their voices. They didn&#x2019;t speak to him or with him or even really at him. They spoke toward him while speaking to each other. The elder had said, &#x201c;It is the sort of day that tiger gourami would be nice.&#x201d; The younger merely nodded.<br> <br>Chen knew it was a command, and he complied. He did so carefully. He fished three gourami out of the ocean. The first fish he threw back. The last one he kept for the sisters, and the largest he gave to a refugee fishwife and her five cubs because her husband was still one of the missing.<br> <br>He&#x2019;d known that giving the sisters the first fish would have been seen as a sign of his being hasty. To give them all three would show he was prone to proud displays of excess. To give them the biggest, which was more than they could eat, would show a lack of discretion and calculation. But in doing what he did, he demonstrated reason, consideration, and charity.<br> <br>Chen did understand that his exercise of dealing with the sisters wasn&#x2019;t likely to win him friends or patronage. Many others he&#x2019;d known in his travels would have considered them ungrateful and ignored them. For Chen, however, they were a means through which he could learn about Pandaria and the people who would become his neighbors.<br> <br>Maybe even my family.<br> <br>If Li Li was an exemplar of the Huojin philosophy, then the Chiang sisters represented believers in the Tushui. They were given to far more contemplation. They measured acts against the ideals of justice and morality&#x2014;though both could easily be a narrow, parochial, small-village version of those grander notions. In fact, grand notions of justice and morality might seem far too ostentatious for the likes of the Chiang sisters.<br> <br>Chen liked to think of himself as being firmly in the middle. He mixed and matched both Huojin and Tushui, or so he told himself. More realistically, he tended toward Huojin when adventuring in the wider world. Here, in Pandaria, with the verdant valleys and tall mountains, with most people enjoying a simple lifestyle, Tushui seemed just the thing.<br> <br>Deep down, that was what Chen needed distraction from. It wasn&#x2019;t about new brewing projects but the knowledge that someday, at some point, he would have to choose one philosophy or the other. If he did make Pandaria his home, if he found a wife and started a family, the days of adventuring would vanish. He&#x2019;d just become a roly-poly brewmaster, armored with an apron, haggling with farmers over the price of grain and with customers over the price of a mug.<br> <br>That wouldn&#x2019;t be a bad life. Not bad at all. Chen neatly stacked firewood for the sisters. But would it be enough?<br> <br>Cub shrieks again attracted his attention. Li Li was down and wasn&#x2019;t getting up. Something sparked inside him&#x2014;that ancient call to battle. He had so many stories of great conflicts. He&#x2019;d fought alongside Rexxar and Vol&#x2019;jin and Thrall. Rescuing his niece would be nothing compared to those battles (and recounting those tales would make his brewery very popular), but taking action fed something within him.<br> <br>Something that defied Tushui.<br> <br>Chen jogged over and waded into the roiling pile of bodies. He grabbed cubs by the scruff of their necks and tossed them to one side and the other. Being mostly muscle and fur, they bounced and rolled and twisted around. A few bumped against one another, with parts pointing up that should have pointed down. They untangled themselves and scrambled to their feet, ready to dive back in.<br> <br>Chen growled with just that right mix of gentle warning and true menace.<br> <br>The cubs froze.<br> <br>The elder pandaren straightened up, and by instinct, so did most of the cubs. &#x201c;What exactly was going on here?&#x201d;<br> <br>One of the bolder cubs, Keng-na, pointed toward a recumbent Li Li. &#x201c;Mistress Li Li was teaching us to fight.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What I witnessed wasn&#x2019;t fighting. It was brawling!&#x201d; Chen shook his head, exaggerating the action. &#x201c;That will not do, not at all, not if the yaungol return. You are to have proper training. Now, look smart!&#x201d; Chen snapped to attention as he gave the command, and the cubs mimicked him perfectly.<br> <br>Chen fought to hide a smile as he dispatched the cubs, singly and in groups, to fetch more wood, to haul water, and to get sand for the sisters&#x2019; pathway and brooms to smooth it down. He clapped his paws sharply, and they sprung to their tasks like arrows loosed from taut bows. He waited until they&#x2019;d all disappeared before he offered Li Li a paw.<br> <br>She looked at it, her nose wrinkled with disgust. &#x201c;I would have won.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Of course, but that wasn&#x2019;t the point, was it?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It wasn&#x2019;t?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No, you were teaching them a sense of camaraderie. They&#x2019;re a little squad now.&#x201d; Chen smiled. &#x201c;A bit of discipline, some division of labor, and they might be useful.&#x201d;<br> <br>He added volume to the last phrase for the sisters, since they&#x2019;d seen that initial benefit.<br> <br>Li Li looked at his paw suspiciously, then took it and used it to steady herself as she stood. She tugged her robe into place and reknotted the sash. &#x201c;Worse than swarming kobolds.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Of course. They are pandaren.&#x201d; This, too, he said loudly so the Chiang sisters could take it in. He lowered his voice again. &#x201c;I admire your restraint.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You aren&#x2019;t kidding.&#x201d; She rubbed her left forearm. &#x201c;Someone was biting in there.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;As well you know, someone is always biting in a fight.&#x201d;<br> <br>Li Li thought for a moment, then smiled. &#x201c;No escaping that. And thank you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;For?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Unburying me.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, that was me being selfish. I was done hauling for the day. No grummle here to help, so that&#x2019;s a detail for your little army.&#x201d;<br> <br>Li Li cocked an eyebrow. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not fooling me.&#x201d;<br> <br>Chen pulled his head high and looked down at her. &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t imagine that I might think a niece of mine, who is a well-trained martial artist in her own right, would need my help with cubs. I mean, if I thought that, I&#x2019;d simply not help you. You&#x2019;d be no niece of mine.&#x201d;<br> <br>She paused, her face scrunching up. Chen could see in the quick movement of her eyes the way she was working through that logic. &#x201c;Okay, yes, Uncle Chen. Thank you.&#x201d;<br> <br>Chen laughed and draped an arm over her shoulder. &#x201c;It is tiring work, dealing with cubs.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;True.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;In my case, of course, I had only one to deal with, but she was a pawful.&#x201d;<br> <br>Li Li dug an elbow into his ribs. &#x201c;Still am.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And I could not be prouder.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I think you could.&#x201d; She spun from beneath his arm. &#x201c;Are you disappointed that I haven&#x2019;t asked if I can work with you at the brewery?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Whatever would have given you that idea?&#x201d;<br> <br>She shrugged uneasily and glanced off toward the Valley of the Four Winds, where the Stormstout Brewery was. &#x201c;When you&#x2019;re there, you are happy. I see that. You love it so.&#x201d;<br> <br>Chen smiled wryly. &#x201c;I do. And do you want to know why I haven&#x2019;t asked you to cease wandering and join me there?&#x201d;<br> <br>Her face brightened. &#x201c;Yes, I want to know.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It is because, my dearest niece, I need a partner who will still adventure. If I need Durotarian mosses from deep inside caves, who will fetch them? And at a good price? The brewery means I have responsibilities. I can&#x2019;t be gone for months or years at a time. So I need someone I can trust, and someone who, someday, can come back and take over for me.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But I&#x2019;m not cut out to be that sort of brewmaster.&#x201d;<br> <br>Chen waved away that objection. &#x201c;Sedentary brewmasters I can hire. Only a Stormstout can run the brewery. Maybe I will hire a cute brewmaster, though, and you can marry him and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;and my cubs will inherit?&#x201d; Li Li shook her head. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll have a brood of cubs next time I see you, I&#x2019;m sure.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But I&#x2019;ll always be happy to see you, Li Li. Always.&#x201d;<br> <br>Chen suspected Li Li would have given him a hug, and he&#x2019;d have gladly returned it, save for two things. First, the sisters were watching, and displays of emotion would make them uncomfortable. More important, however, was that Keng-na came dashing through their vegetable garden, howling, eyes wide.<br> <br>&#x201c;Master Chen, Master Chen, there&#x2019;s a monster in the river! A big monster! He&#x2019;s blue and has red hair and he&#x2019;s awful cut up. He&#x2019;s clinging to the bank. He has claws!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Li Li, gather the cubs. Keep them away from the water. Don&#x2019;t follow me.&#x201d;<br> <br>She stared at him. &#x201c;But what if&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;If I need your help, I&#x2019;ll shout. Go, quickly.&#x201d; He glanced at the sisters. &#x201c;It looks as if it might storm. You might consider going inside. And locking the door.&#x201d;<br> <br>They stared defiantly at him for a moment but uttered not a word. He sprinted off, cutting around the garden, and oriented himself on the wooden bucket Keng-na had abandoned. Tracing the boy&#x2019;s path through flattened weeds to the riverbank wasn&#x2019;t hard, and Chen was halfway down the embankment when he saw the monster.<br> <br>And recognized it immediately. A troll!<br> <br>Keng-na had been right. The troll had been hacked badly. His clothing hung in tatters, and the flesh beneath was not in much better shape. The troll had half-pulled himself out of the river; clawed hands and a tusk thrust into the clay bank were the only things that anchored him.<br> <br>Chen dropped to a knee and turned the troll onto his back.<br> <br>&#x201c;Vol&#x2019;jin!&#x201d;<br> <br>Chen stared at him and the ruin of his throat. If not for the rasp of breath through the hole in his neck, and the bloody red seepage from the wounds, the pandaren would have imagined his old friend to be dead. And he might still die.<br> <br>Chen grabbed Vol&#x2019;jin&#x2019;s arms and pulled him from the river. It wasn&#x2019;t easy. Scrabbling came from higher up the bank, and then Li Li was at Vol&#x2019;jin&#x2019;s left shoulder, helping her uncle.<br> <br>The pandaren&#x2019;s eyes met. &#x201c;I thought I heard you yell.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Maybe I did.&#x201d; Chen bent low to the ground, then lifted the troll in his arms. &#x201c;My friend Vol&#x2019;jin is badly hurt. Maybe poisoned. I don&#x2019;t know what he&#x2019;s doing here. I don&#x2019;t know if he will live.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s Vol&#x2019;jin, from all your stories.&#x201d; Li Li stared wide-eyed at the mangled creature. &#x201c;What are you going to do?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll do what we can for him here.&#x201d; Chen looked up toward Kun-Lai Summit and the Shado-pan Monastery built high upon it. &#x201c;Then I guess I&#x2019;ll take him there and see if the monks have room for another of my foundlings.&#x201d;</p><h2>A Passion for Baking: Bake to celebrate, Bake to nourish, Bake for fun</h2><p>A fun-filled, lavishly illustrated introduction to modern baking techniques presents more than two hundred original recipes that combine high-quality ingredients with new interpretations of traditional baking methods to create delectable breads, muffins, cookies, and more, along with step-by-step photographs that demonstrate a variety of baking techniques and tricks.</p><p><p>HI, aside from my cookbooks, you can visit me at my website, Betterbaking, an online baking and lifestyle magazine I launched in 1997.

Her friends are sure it's someone's idea of a joke, but when Megan is murdered in a vicious attack, NYPD Detective Ellie Hatcher is convinced that the online threats are more than just empty words.</p><p>With smooth, straight-talking partner J. J. Rogan at her side, Ellie tries to identify Megan's enemies, but she begins to wonder if the coed's murder was more than just the culmination of a cyber obsession. Phone records reveal a link between Megan and a murdered real estate agent who was living a dangerous double life. The detectives also learn that the dead real estate agent shared a secret connection to a celebrity mogul whose bodyguard was mysteriously killed a few months earlier. And when Megan's roommate suddenly disappears, they know they have to find her before another young woman dies.</p><p>Exposing the darkness that lurks beneath the glamorous surface of New York City, <em>212</em> delivers yet another "knuckle-biting journey that'll keep you turning pages until the very end" (Faye Kellerman).</p><p>Alafair Burke is a <em>New York Times </em>bestselling author&nbsp;whose novels include the standalone thrillers <em>The Ex, Long Gone </em>and <em>If You Were Here</em>, and the Ellie Hatcher series: <em>All Day and a Night</em>, <em>Never Tell</em>, <em>212</em>, <em>Angel&#x2019;s Tip</em>, and <em>Dead Connection</em>.

Cracking open the door to his daughter&#x2019;s bedroom, he saw that she hadn&#x2019;t come home from her night out with friends. Her bed was still made and arranged with the stuffed teddy bears she loved and collected.<br><br>The fifty-eight-year-old remembered his youth when kids still had curfews. These days, the parties continued well past dawn. He only had a few ground rules with Stephany but checking in was one of them. She hadn&#x2019;t even left a message about her whereabouts. She was going to get an earful when she did report in.<br><br>The last time Ricardo had spoken to his daughter was the previous evening. He&#x2019;d reached her on her cell just before 10 P.M. to invite her to an impromptu family dinner at a grill not far from the Floreses&#x2019; home in Santiago de Surco. Stephany told her father she was hanging out with friends in Larcomar, a three-level mall of boutiques, eateries, and movie theaters carved into the cliff at the edge of Miraflores, overlooking the Pacific Ocean.<br><br>By day, Miraflores was a bustling place full of foreigners eager to see the sights. A half-hour drive from Jorge Ch�vez International Airport, Miraflores catered to both well-heeled travelers residing in four-star hotels on the cliffs overlooking the Pacific Ocean and backpackers flopping in cheap hostels. Special tourist police and English-friendly information booths sought to give the place a feeling of calm and safety amid the polluted chaos that was greater metropolitan Lima.<br><br>In the district&#x2019;s central square, Parque Kennedy, olive-skinned women in colorful Indian garb sold traditional indigenous paintings, tapestries, and other knickknacks. &#x201c;Hey Mee-stir&#x201d; or &#x201c;Hey Lay-dee,&#x201d; they would call out, employing the little English they knew. Camera-toting travelers from all points of the globe would stand in line, tickets in hand, for seats on the red double-decker Mirabuses to explore a myriad of museums, pre-Incan ruins, and even catacombs buried deep beneath an ancient Spanish monastery farther downtown. At lunchtime, barkers with broad friendly smiles would stand on the sidewalks corralling hungry foreigners into relatively inexpensive caf�s to feast on enormous plates of ceviche, <i>pinchos,</i> and Chifa, a wild fusion of traditional Peruvian and Chinese cuisine. Restaurants were equipped with special hooks on the underside of tables to keep purses, knapsacks, and cameras away from street thieves.<br><br>The intoxicating smells of lunchtime, the biggest meal of the day, almost masked the thick odor of exhaust that hovered over the city; trapped between the cool winds of the Pacific and the foothills of the Andes on the other side of town, the sickening, damp, polluted air had no place to go. To say the air quality was poor was an understatement. From June through December, a thick, gray fog, known as &#x201c;<i>la gar�a,</i>&#x201d; hung over the city, obscuring what would otherwise be spectacular views of the Pacific coastline.<br><br>By night, Miraflores was another place entirely. Cars would race by at breakneck speeds, making the simple act of crossing the street a dangerous endeavor. Neon signs advertised McDonald&#x2019;s, Burger King, and Starbucks and might seem out of place, but the American fast-food establishments were always packed with budget travelers and locals. The action started late and typically began with a round of pisco sours, Peru&#x2019;s national cocktail made from brandy, lemon juice, and sugar, topped with frothy egg whites and a drop of Angostura bitters. The drink, surprisingly strong, tasted a bit like margaritas and fueled the laughter, loud conversations, and occasional bar fights. Nightclubs and casinos sprang to life when the sun went down.<br><br>After dusk, the district of Miraflores was party central and the revelry often spilled into the streets as bleary-eyed packs of tourists stumbled from bar to bar. Patrols of heavily armed police officers in black flak jackets kept a careful watch over the foreigners, wobbly from the excesses of the evening and vulnerable to petty crime.<br><br>Ricardo was aware of Miraflores&#x2019;s wild nightlife, and although he worried about his daughter&#x2019;s absence that morning, he also realized she was twenty-one and an adult.<br><br>Annoyed that she hadn&#x2019;t touched base with the family, Ricardo dialed her cell phone. It rang a few times and then went to voice mail. Clearly the phone was on, but she wasn&#x2019;t answering.<br>Ricardo had always been a little overprotective of Stephany. The father of five children, he only had one daughter, his baby girl. As Stephany was growing up, he was rarely seen without his little <i>nenita</i> in tow.<br><br>When Stephany was two years old, the family owned a circus. It was a good, old-fashioned tent circus, complete with trapeze acts and a menagerie of exotic animals. Stephany loved to be around the elephants, bears, and tigers. Because her mother, Mariaelena, was the manager, she was able to spend her days hanging out with carnival workers who shared their strange and curious world with the tiny brown-eyed brunette. The performers loved Stephany and saw her as a kindred spirit. Like them, she was a bit mischievous and utterly fearless.<br><br>One day, Ricardo received a call from his wife asking him to head over to the main tent. When he arrived, there was a rehearsal in progress. He nearly passed out when he saw his two-year-old dressed in a frilly, pink tutu seated atop an elephant making its way into the arena. It was an unforgettable moment. Ricardo felt pride tinged with horror as he admired his tiny daughter&#x2019;s courage. She was all smiles balanced atop the giant pachyderm. It turned out she&#x2019;d been practicing for weeks without his knowledge under the direction of the circus&#x2019;s veteran animal trainer. And his wife was a co-conspirator.<br><br>Years later, Stephany would be involved in another daredevil stunt, this time with her father. The two of them decided to keep Mariaelena in the dark. Ricardo was a well-known race-car driver, a good-looking older man with thick jet-black hair, deeply tanned skin, and a cleft chin, and his televised skills on the rally racing circuit had earned him near-celebrity status in Peru. His team&#x2019;s name was Riflo, a contraction of his first and last names. The team had won the internationally famous Caminos del Inca Peru Rally in 1991, a 2,700-kilometer (1,680-mile) circuit divided into five grueling stages. The race placed tremendous pressure on both the car and driver. The Andean leg took drivers and their vehicles to altitudes of 15,000 feet, about 4,500 meters, and required that participants carry oxygen on board. Speeding up and down steep mountain roads, past high cliff walls lacking any safety rails, an unlucky driver could easily slide off a crumbling embankment into the abyss. Certain death lay below. The danger, the speed, the steely grins of the racers who had survived the sometimes deadly course generated female groupies. These men were superstars in their own right.<br><br>In the years following his victory, Riflo enjoyed this celebrity status. He also served two terms as president of the Peruvian Automobile Club. Off the track he wore tailor-made suits that hung gracefully from his lean, well-toned body. His look was classy and successful but he had a gangster&#x2019;s edge and carried himself with a confidence that would serve him well from the racetrack to the boardroom.<br><br>Rally drivers were always accompanied by a navigator whose job was to shout out the unseen course in front of them. The navigator had to know the route and read from written notes as he simultaneously watched for the dips and turns in the road ahead. He had to know every curve and elevation change. It was a position with no margin for error. The slightest miscalculation could send a driver over the edge of a high cliff wall before he even realized he&#x2019;d reached it. The driver and navigator had to be in sync and must have complete faith and trust in one another. On and off the racecourse, Ricardo Flores loved being behind the wheel and insisted on being in the driver&#x2019;s seat. Even when he was out with his family he did all the driving. He selected a navigator with great care.<br><br>Stephany was in her teens when she first expressed an interest in racing, and she and her father hatched a plan to get her into the navigator&#x2019;s seat for a real race. Normally, Team Riflo wore red fireproof racing suits, red being the team color. But Ricardo had two blue uniforms custom-made for him and Stephany. They would also register using pseudonyms.<br><br>In a sport dominated by men, it would be unheard of for a driver to use his sixteen-year-old daughter as a navigator. And he was sure his wife would object. The plan went awry when Mariaelena caught the two sneaking the suits out of the house. Admitting everything, Ricardo pleaded with his wife to let him take Stephany. He promised to keep his daughter safe.<br><br>Ultimately, Mariaelena acquiesced. She trusted her husband. When Stephany was a baby, the family had nicknamed him <i>&#x201c;Pap� Gallana,&#x201d;</i> or Father Hen, because of the way he guarded over her. She accepted that he would not recklessly endanger their daughter&#x2019;s life. Their shared passion for racing trumped the risk.<br><br>Now, standing in the hallway outside of Stephany&#x2019;s bedroom, Ricardo felt his daughter slipping away. There was more to his concern than her failure to check in that evening. She had been spending a lot of nights out on the town. He&#x2019;d recently discovered she was frequenting the casinos of Miraflores, and had gotten herself in over her head. He&#x2019;d even bailed her out earlier in the year, buying her a new car after he learned that she&#x2019;d sold her Mitsubushi in an online auction for the equivalent of U.S.$12,000 to cover her gambling debts. Ricardo was upset when he found out what she had done, and he settled the obligation, warning his daughter that owing money was both reckless and dangerous. He didn&#x2019;t know for sure, but he suspected his daughter was still gambling.<br><br>Gambling in the Flores household was something of a family pastime. It was done for recreation, just like Americans might bet on the Superbowl or basketball&#x2019;s March Madness with friends. Sometimes the buy-in was U.S.$100, which might seem steep, even obscene, in a country as poor as Peru, but in the Floreses&#x2019; minds dinner out and a night on the town would be just as expensive.<br><br>The senior Flores had been a gambler, and knew it had a darker side. Ricardo&#x2019;s game had been baccarat. But at home the family played poker. And Stephany was good. She even told friends and family that she dreamed of becoming a professional poker player. She excelled at everything she did, and hated to lose. While she shared her mother&#x2019;s light complexion and soft facial features, she had definitely inherited her thick, dark hair and competitive nature from her father.<br>Ricardo had hoped his daughter had learned her lesson after hocking her car, but just a few days earlier she&#x2019;d hit him up for the equivalent of U.S.$1,000, claiming she needed a new laptop for school. As far as he knew, she hadn&#x2019;t yet purchased one. He hoped she wasn&#x2019;t gambling again.<br><br>Stephany&#x2019;s mother, Mariaelena, a striking blonde who was stylish and chic, was equally concerned when she learned their daughter had not contacted them. She and her husband had both checked their cell phones; neither had a message. When she dialed Stephany&#x2019;s number, the Nextel phone she carried appeared to be on, but it just rang several times before going to voice mail. This was odd.<br>When Stephany had stayed out all night in the past, she was good about letting her parents know her whereabouts. In fact, she was usually the one keeping tabs on her father, who, like Stephany, was a free spirit.<br><br>The Floreses&#x2019; home was in the quiet neighborhood of Chacarilla, an affluent oasis within the district of Surco, fifteen minutes from Miraflores. Surco itself ran the gamut of economic conditions, from rich to poor. Chacarilla was a work of gentrification in progress. The blocks of beautiful, expensive homes and classy shopping malls that made up its core deteriorated rapidly at the periphery. Almost from one block to another, the upscale areas changed to cinderblock storefronts and half-built dwellings that formed the backdrop of an impoverished district. Street children juggled plastic balls at stoplights for coins and women sold fruit from pushcarts as groups of men stood in small clusters drinking beer on the corners. Where rich and poor collided, the affluent tended to be on edge.<br>Armed paramilitary patrols would attempt to keep these affluent transplants safe as they relocated to the neighborhood, attracted by low real estate prices and the illusion of finding safety in numbers. Many of the homes on Ricardo&#x2019;s block were new and a few were still under construction.<br><br>Ricardo had been able to keep his family protected within the sanctuary of their new home. To prevent would-be home invaders from gaining easy access, he had built a twelve-foot concrete wall surrounding his house. Many of the city&#x2019;s residents installed an additional layer of razor wire or electrified fencing to fend off the home invaders and burglars that plagued Lima. But Ricardo had forgone this additional precaution. The private security booth, manned twenty-four hours a day, was next door.<br><br>With all these safety measures, he was only able to provide protection for his wife and the couple&#x2019;s three children&#x2014;Stephany, a second son he also named Ricardo, and Bobby&#x2014;when they were at home. Outside one needed street smarts and luck. Stephany had neither.<br><br>Ricardo was a relatively lenient disciplinarian. He gave his children a certain amount of freedom and believed that kids learned best by making their own mistakes. Still, it wasn&#x2019;t like Stephany to be out of touch for more than a few hours.<br><br>Ricardo&#x2019;s mind cycled through the possibilities. Repeated calls to Stephany&#x2019;s cell phone went unanswered. By late morning, he and his wife were frantically calling anyone who may have seen her, including her two older brothers, Ricardo Jr. and Enrique. The two were Ricardo&#x2019;s adult sons from his first marriage, but they were very close to their half sister.<br><br>Ricardo Jr., nicknamed Richie, was fourteen when Stephany was born. He had been the one to choose her name and its unusual spelling. Now thirty-five and a single dad, he cut a larger-than-life figure in the bars and restaurants of Miraflores. He stood well over six feet tall with thick curly hair, long sideburns, and a broad and expressive smile, which made him one of the most eligible bachelors in the neighborhood. As a younger man working for a catering company in northern California, he&#x2019;d developed a taste for good food and was both fond and proud of Lima&#x2019;s nouveau cuisine. He was treated like a VIP by the chefs and ma�tre d&#x2019;s and was always the one to suggest the hot new restaurant when meeting his father and the rest of the family for impromptu get-togethers.<br><br>The day before, Saturday, he had invited the family to lunch to celebrate his son, Sebastian&#x2019;s, first birthday and was disappointed that his kid sister hadn&#x2019;t been able to join them. Stephany had told the family she had to sit for an exam and wouldn&#x2019;t be finished in time. Richie had recently gone back to school himself, studying for a Master&#x2019;s in business administration, and understood the pressures of academic life. He had just settled in on the couch and was watching cartoons with Sebastian when his phone rang.<br><br>&#x201c;We can&#x2019;t find Stephany. She never came home last night. Have you heard from her?&#x201d; His father sounded nervous and worried.<br>&#x201c;No, Dad, I have no idea where she is.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve been calling her cell phone and she&#x2019;s not picking up.

Turns out America&#39;s &#39;cooking sweetheart&#39; is a bossy, bad-tempered, and downright domineering. Things finally boil over when Hannah arrives at The Cookie Jar to find the Winter Carnival cake burnt to a crisp - and Connie Mac lying dead in her pantry, struck down while eating one of Hannah&#39;s famous blueberry muffins.Next thing Hannah knows, the police have declared The Cookie Jar&#39;s kitchen crime scene off-limits.

Like Hannah Swensen, Joanne Fluke was born and raised in a small town in rural Minnesota, but now lives in Southern California. Please visit her online at www.JoanneFluke.comIn her third top-of-the-line culinary cozy (after 2001's Strawberry Shortcake Murder), the delightful amateur sleuth Hannah Swensen once again faces murder and mayhem with good cheer. To fight the late February doldrums, Lake Eden, Minn., is about to celebrate its first winter carnival with ice sports on the lake, activities for children and Hannah's delicious cookies from her shop, the Cookie Jar. The whole town is involved, and even Hannah's mother, who usually spends her time trying to get Hannah married, has found a new interest in recreating the home of one of Lake Eden's founding fathers. Connie MacIntyre, bestselling cook book author and star of a popular cable TV cooking show, has agreed to make the cake for the carnival banquet. But when Hannah discovers Connie's dead body in the pantry of the Cookie Jar, Hannah and her sister Andrea join forces to track down the killer, despite warnings by one of her boyfriends, policeman Mike Kensington, to stay out of the investigation. Since everyone who had contact with the abusive Connie disliked her, the sisters have plenty of suspects. Delicious food descriptions and recipes, warm and familiar characters who grow into real people (Hannah's increasing respect for Andrea is a highlight), a vivid picture of the small lake town and a well-crafted mystery provide the ingredients for yet another tempting feast that should satisfy all fans, old and new.

The rugged geography of the region allowed Native American societies, especially the Cherokee, to flourish. Early white settlers tended to favor a self-sufficient approach to farming, contrary to the land grabbing and plantation building going on elsewhere in the South. </p><p>The growth of a market economy and competition from other agricultural areas of the country sparked an economic decline of the region&#x2019;s rural population at least as early as 1830. The Civil War and the sometimes hostile legislation of Reconstruction made life even more difficult for rural Appalachians. </p><p>Recent history of the region is marked by the corporate exploitation of fossil fuel resources. Regional oil, gas, and coal had attracted some industry even before the Civil War, but the postwar years saw an immense expansion of American industry, nearly all of which relied heavily on Appalachian fossil fuels, particularly coal. What was initially a boon to the region eventually brought financial disaster to many mountain people as unsafe working conditions and strip mining ravaged the land and its inhabitants. </p><p>A History of Appalachia also examines pockets of urbanization in Appalachia. Chemical, textile, and other industries have encouraged the development of urban areas. At the same time, radio, television, and the internet provide residents direct links to cultures from all over the world. The author looks at the process of urbanization as it belies commonly held notions about the region&#x2019;s rural character. </p><p>For more than twenty years historians have expressed the critical need for a single-volume history of Appalachia. Richard Drake has skillfully woven together the various strands of the Appalachian experience into a sweeping whole. Touching upon folk traditions, health care, the environment, higher education, the role of blacks and women, and much more, Drake offers a compelling social history of a unique American region.</p></p><p>Richard B.

He joined the British Navy at&nbsp;age 15 and retired from the Royal Navy Reserve with the rank of Lieutenant Commander. He is the author of The Kydd Sea Adventures series.<p><b>Chapter 1</b> </p><p> Thomas Kydd stood awkwardly on the deck of the frigate with his few possessions at his feet. A bare hour ago he had been an ordinary seaman in the old line-of-battle ship <i>Duke William.</i> Now, somewhere off the enemy coast of Revolutionary France, he was gazing back at her from a crack frigate as an able seaman, a replacement for prize crew. </p><p> A hand lifted in farewell in the boat pulling back to the big ship-of-the-line. It was Whaley, and with a lump in his throat Kydd realized that he would probably never see his broad smile again or share a grog with his other old shipmates. It had started hard -- as a young perruquier from Guildford, Kydd had been seized by the press-gang six months before, but despite all he had suffered, he had come to admire the skill and courage of the seamen. And now, as a sailor himself, he was parting from the ship that had been his home for so long. </p><p> He waved in return and forced his attention back inboard. </p><p> Men were waiting on deck -- a weatherbeaten older man in plain black and a much worn tricorne, a hard-looking lieutenant in serviceable seagoing blues, a childlike midshipman without a hat, and the man at the wheel, stolidly chewing tobacco. Next to Kydd, Renzi gave a conspiratorial grimace. They had been through much together, he and his friend. The others in the little party looked equally bemused: Stirk, the tough gun captain; Doud, the devil-may-care topman; Doggo, a ferally ugly able seaman; Pinto, a neat and deadly Iberian; and Wong, the inscrutable circus strongman. But there would be no complaint; service in a fast frigate ranging the oceans for prey and prize money was infinitely preferable to the boredom of a big ship on blockade duty. </p><p> "Brace around that foresail -- run away with it, you damn sluggards!" The hard bellow from behind startled Kydd. "Away aloft, you dawdling old women -- lay out and loose!" The officer was dressed in austere sea rig, only faded lace indicating that here was the most powerful man aboard, a post captain in the Royal Navy and commander of the frigate. </p><p> The men leaped to obey. Kydd saw that they moved with enthusiasm and speed, quite unlike the heavy, deliberate movements he'd been used to in the battleship. Some made a race of it, sprinting along the top of the swaying yard before dropping to the footrope in a daring display of skill. </p><p> <i>Artemis</i> responded immediately, the chuckle of water under her forefoot feathering rapidly, the creaking of cordage and sheaves as more sails were sheeted home soon rewarded with an eager swoop across the broad Atlantic swell. Kydd felt the lively response with a lifting of the heart. To windward, in the <i>Duke William,</i> the ponderous spars were still coming around, but the frigate was already stretching over the sparkling sea, impatient to be away. </p><p> Turning to them, the Captain roared, "Lay aft, you men!" He stood abaft the wheel: with no poop in a frigate the spar deck swept unbroken from the beakhead forward in a sweet curve right aft to the taffrail. </p><p> Kydd and the others moved quickly. This was Black Jack Powlett, the famous frigate captain who already had five prizes to his name safe in English ports. There was no mistaking the quality of the man, the hard, penetrating stare and pugnacious forward lean of his body. </p><p> He looked at them speculatively, hands clasped behind his back. "So you're all able seamen?" His eyes flicked over to the fast receding bulk of the three-decker astern. "Goddamn it -- I'll not believe Caldwell has only prime hands to spare." His voice was cool, but there was a restlessness in his manner, a coiled energy that seemed to radiate out to those around him. His hand stroked his close-shaven blue-black jaw as he tried to make sense of the gift. "You, sir!" he snapped at Doud. "Pray be so good as to touch the sheave of the flying jibboom." </p><p> Doud gaped, then turned and darted forward. He was being asked to touch the very tip of the bowsprit eighty feet out over the sea. </p><p> Powlett drew out a silver watch. "And you, sir," he rounded on Renzi, "both stuns'l boom irons of the fore t'gallant yard." </p><p> The restless eyes settled on Kydd, who tensed. "To touch the main truck, if you please." The main truck -- the very highest point in the vessel. Kydd knew that his standing as seaman rested on his actions of the next few minutes. </p><p> He swung nimbly into the main shrouds, heaving himself up the ratlines and around the futtock shrouds. On and up the main topmast shrouds he swarmed, conserving his strength for the last lap. At the main topmast top the ratlines stopped. He stepped out onto the cross trees and looked down. Already at a height of one hundred and thirty feet, he was as far aloft as he had ever been before. But still above was the royal yard -- and beyond that the truck. </p><p> He grasped the single-rope topgallant mast shrouds firmly. At this height the pitch and roll were fierce and he was jerked through a vertiginous seventy-foot arc. His feet pinioning the tarred rope, and hands pulling upward, he made his way to the light royal yard and past that to the seizings of the main royal backstay. The truck was only a matter of a few feet farther, a round cap at the very tip of the mast -- but now there was nothing but the bare mast. </p><p> The motion was alarming, a soaring through the airy firmament before a whipping stop and surge the other way. The pole mast was only a few inches thick and he locked his legs around it securely before transferring his grip and hauling himself upward. Not daring to look down he watched the truck come closer -- nearer, and then it was within his reach. Something rattled on the far side of the mast. He followed it up and saw that it was a stout chain clamped to the round of the truck. A newfangled lightning conductor. On a crazy impulse he transferred his hands to the chain and drew himself up to the truck itself. A strong copper rod continued in the thin air beyond the truck. </p><p> It was the work of moments to heave himself up and past the cap -- and then he was standing erect on the bird-slimed truck, trembling with fatigue and exhilaration and holding the lightning rod in a death grip. He flung up an arm to indicate his position, but before starting his descent he snatched a look at the panorama. Every part of the vessel was now at a level below him, decks, masts, sails. Not a single thing intruded to spoil the totality of his three-hundred-and-sixty-degree view. </p><p> Carefully lowering himself back down the mast, he slid the few feet to the royal backstay. Transferring his grip from mast to stay he soared hand over hand down the backstay to the deck again. </p><p> "I do confess I am at a stand. It's no parcel of lubberly landmen we have here, Mr. Spershott," Powlett said to the lean officer next to him. </p><p><br> It took a moment or two for Kydd to realize why the mess deck was so different. There were the same mess tables and ship's side racks for cutlery and mess traps, but here there were no massive cannon regularly spaced along the sides. Aboard the battleship Kydd was used to having his living space between a pair of massive thirty-two-pounder long guns, sharing his domestics with the smoke and blast of broadsides, but here there was only a single function. </p><p> It was noon and the berth deck was alive with gossip and laughter after the issue of grog. A ship's boy had shown them to their new mess, half the party to a starboard mess, the other to larboard. They stood awkwardly. </p><p> "Hear tell they's promising ter send us some real man-o'-war hands," said a thin-looking older man at the ship's side. Kydd knew enough about unwritten mess etiquette to realize that this was the senior hand of the mess. Like the others, he deliberately chose not to notice the newcomers. </p><p> A handsome, well-groomed sailor replied, "As long as they're not ship-of-the-line jacks is all I asks. Them big-ship ways -- no room fer marching up an' down in this little barky." </p><p> The older man snorted. "Nor all that there flags an' buntin' all th' time. An' yer've gotta be slow in th' wits to be big ships, else yer intellects rot, waitin' while the ship wants ter tack about." </p><p> "Has t' be a big ship," came back the other, "all them pressed men -- why, they has to batten 'em down when they makes port, else they'll think to ramble off home, like." </p><p> The older man started, as though seeing the arrivals for the first time. "Well, look who it ain't. A parcel o' <i>Royal Billy</i>s! Sit yerselves down then -- grog's up." </p><p> Self-consciously Kydd edged over and sat next to a neat, slightly built sailor who held out his hand with a pleasant smile. "Guess we have t' take ye aboard, we being grievous shorthanded 'n' all!" he said. "Adam -- Nathan Adam." </p><p> "Kydd, Tom Kydd." He flushed with pleasure, quite unconscious of the striking figure of a seaman he now made. His dark, strong features were well set off by the short blue jacket, white duck trousers, and a red kerchief knotted carelessly over a blue-striped waistcoat. His ebony hair gleamed in a tight clubbed pigtail, his tanned, open face bore a broad white smile. </p><p> Sliding in easily next to Kydd, Renzi sat opposite. Curious looks met his from around the table, for he was most definitely at variance with the usual man-o'-war's man with his careful, intelligent dark eyes and a face with incised lines of character suggesting dangerous mystery. Renzi's black hair, short to the point of monasticism, also hinted at an inner discipline quite unlike the carefree sailor's. </p><p> He was next to a well-muscled black man, who turned to greet him. "Never bin in a ship-o'-the-line, meself," he said. "Guess there's plenty more room in them big ships." </p><p> "Know where I'd rather be," Kydd said. </p><p> The senior hand interrupted. "Got yer traps?" Kydd fished around in his ditty bag and drew out his tankard, an old brass-strapped wooden one that had once belonged to a close shipmate, now dead. </p><p> "Me apologies about the blackstrap," the man said, upending a bottle into the tankard. "Cap'n thinks to give us this'n instead o' the right sort." He shrugged. "Took a thousan' off a Frenchy last week." </p><p> Renzi's eyes widened. He picked up the bottle eagerly and stared at the label. "My God!" he said. "Haut Brion, <i>premier cru,</i> the seventy-nine no less!" His beautifully modulated patrician tones took them aback quite as much as his words, but in the age-old custom of the sea, no obvious notice was taken of a character quirk. </p><p> "Hey, now, yer mate likes our grog, then," the black man said happily. </p><p> The senior hand banged on the table with his grog can, a little of the rich dark wine spilling. Mature and lined, with an oddly soft voice, he announced, "We has new chums, mates." The others paid attention. "Name's Petit, Elias Petit, 'n' yer already knows Nathan. Yon hulkin' blackamoor -- we call 'im Quashee, 'n' if yer wants ter raise a right decent sea-pie, he's yer man." </p><p> Kydd nodded. "Tom Kydd, an' Nicholas Renzi," he said, gesturing toward Renzi. He noticed the curiosity that Renzi's manner had evoked, but continued, "and Pinto, er -- " </p><p> "Fernando da Mesouta Pinto, at your service," the wall-faced Iberian added smoothly. </p><p> "Pinto is a Portugee," Kydd said, "and Nicholas is my particular friend," he concluded firmly. </p><p> A thatch-haired lad brought up two kids of food and thumped them on the table. </p><p> "Thank 'ee, Luke," Petit said. The lad upended a wooden tub to sit on and looked at the newcomers with the frankness of youth. Petit lifted the lid of one wooden container. "'Tis poor stuff only," he announced defensively, and began doling out the food. </p><p> Kydd could hardly believe his eyes. Real china plates instead of squares of dark wood, a pewter spoon and even a fork. And the food! The oatmeal was not only seasoned with herbs but the meat was pig's trotters with collops of real meat -- this was a feast. </p><p> Petit looked at Kydd curiously. "So yer likes our scran too," he said. </p><p> Kydd thought of the single galley in the ship-of-the-line serving eight hundred men. You could have anything so long as it could be boiled in the vast coppers. "Yessir!" he answered. "We has a saying in Royal Billy which we hear before we begins our salt beef." He assumed an air of reverence. </p><p> <i>Old horse, old horse, what brought you here? </i></p><p><i> You've carried me gear for many a year! </i></p><p><i> An' now wore out with sore abuse </i></p><p><i> They salt you down for sailor's use! </i></p><p><i> They gaze on you with sad surprise </i></p><p><i> They roll ye over and bugger y'r eyes </i></p><p><i> They eat y'r meat and pick your bones </i></p><p><i> And send the rest t' Davey Jones!</i> </p><p> Laughing, they fell upon the food. Kydd glanced across the width of the deck to the mess opposite. Doggo, Wong and the others were clearly enjoying their change of fortune also, and a slow wink broke Stirk's oaken face. </p><p> "Hear tell as how y'r Black Jack is a tartar," mumbled Kydd, his mouth full. </p><p> "Not as who would say," Petit replied. "The cat ain't seen th' daylight this five weeks or more -- Cap'n, he knows it's us what fights the ship for 'im, 'n' so he treats us a-right, does he." </p><p> "What about the first luff?" Kydd asked, absentmindedly tapping a piece of hardtack on the table. To his surprise no black-headed weevils squirmed out. </p><p> "Spershott? Don't say much. Keeps station on the Cap'n always, he does," said Petit dismissively. "It's Parry yer wants ter watch. Second luff. Thinks he's goin' to make his mark b' comin' down on Rowley, the third -- it's Devil-bait agin Harry Flashers all bloody day long." </p><p> "An' Neville," prompted Quashee. </p><p> "An' Neville," agreed Petit. "Kinda fourth luff, but supernumer'y -- wished on us b' the Admiral who wants to put him in the way of a mort o' prize money, my guess." He grunted and added, "But a square sort, I'll grant yer." </p><p> Kydd took another pull at his tankard. The wine was rich and smooth. Adam seemed not to relish it. "Not to y'r taste, Nathan?" Kydd asked amiably. </p><p> The courteous expression did not change. "Christ abstained." </p><p> "Blue light sailor," said Petit, wiping his mouth. "But he dursn't top it the preacher wi' us." </p><p> Kydd nodded, and looking at Adam continued with a smile, "Aye, but Christ made damn sure the wedding wasn't dry, though, didn't he!" </p><p> Adam looked at him steadily and sipped his drink. </p><p> "Where are we headed, do you believe?" Renzi asked. </p><p> "Where there's a Frenchy what swims." Quashee chuckled. He aped a prize agent reluctantly doling out the guineas -- so ludicrous was the sight of his bulk going through the motions that the mess fell about helpless. </p><p> Petit clapped him on the back. "True enough, yer black bastard. That is ter say that we're raidin' commerce, which is ter say that ev'rything what is under sail has ter loose tops'ls to us, 'n' we has first pickin's." </p><p> At the fore-hatchway the squeal of a boatswain's calls cut through the sociability. Reluctantly the sailors rose. </p><p><br> Evening quarters was exercised every day at sea in <i>Artemis</i>. At four bells in the last dog-watch, the entire ship's company closed up for action to the stirring sound ...</p></p><h2>Elegance - A Guide to Quality in Menswear</h2><p>What should you look for when you buy a suit? Where can you find the best boots in Texas, or the perfect English umbrella? Is a custom-made shirt really more expensive than one off the shelf? Would you look better in the shaped tailoring of European designers - or simply foolish? The answers to these and may other questions both practical and aesthetic are found in Bruce Boyer&#39;s wonderfully readable book on menswear. The author draws on over a decade of experience as an international fashion commentator to examine the evolution of the male wardrobe garment by garment, uncloud the confusion, and help you decide what is right for you. In addition to the wealth of practical advice on styles, shopping, maintenance, and packing, the author brings a lively sense of history and personality to the writing of this book. The result is a book that is at once practical, delightful, and historical, a guide and source book, illustrated with over 60 drawings, to help you find your way through the expanding and often confusing world of menswear.</p><p>Elegance consists of 32 essays on men's clothing, some of which appeared previously in Town &amp; Country or in Diversion. Boyer emphasizes quality, natural fabrics, and classic styling. Although he includes practical suggestions for buying and caring for apparel, he also devotes considerable attention to the historical development of men's attire. Numerous anecdotes and Kokinos's striking illustrations round out the book. Donald Dolce's The Consumer's Guide to Menswear ( LJ 9/1/83) also focuses on quality in men's clothing. Of the two books, Dolce's is the more practical, Boyer's the more literary and historical. Suitable for fashion history and consumer collections. Wendy Allex, Central Arkansas Lib.

She lived in Lebanon for many years and now resides in Bloomington, Indiana, with her husband.Grade 5-8&#x2013;An enjoyable and often surprising collection of stories about Arab teenagers living in modern-day Egypt, Lebanon, Syria, Palestine, and Iraq. Like Marston's nonfiction title <i>Women in the Middle East: Tradition and Change</i> (Scholastic, 1996), these stories dispel many stereotypes about this part of the world. The young people are facing some specifically Middle Eastern issues such as the U.S. embargo on Iraq and the hardships of life in a Palestinian refugee camp, but they also have concerns that will be familiar to American readers: loyalty to friends, dreams of a future career, and feelings of being torn between divorced parents. The characters are complex and interesting, and the Middle Eastern settings are described in rich detail. Each selection is followed by a note in which the author explains social issues specific to the story that may be unfamiliar to readers. This collection will appeal to those who enjoyed Naomi Shihab Nye's <i>Habibi</i> (S &amp; S, 1997) and would also be a good choice for classes discussing this part of the world or multicultural issues in general.<i>&#x2013;Kathleen E.

He was crouched with his back against a rough brick wall and a man called Colum Allen was beside him. Colum was sometimes called Hallion or Hallinan or the Welsh Saint, the last of these nicknames persisting despite his energetic claims to have no Welsh in him at all. He was tall and thin with a great vein forking up the left side of his neck. Even in the dim you could see it flickering. It moved whenever he spoke, which was always. His leg jerked up and down. Punching his palm was a frequent hobby too. Nodding his head. Biting his fingernails. Humming. Singing. Some of the many daily ways Colum relieved the pressure of being Colum. </p><p>&#x201c;Predetermined is what it is.&#x201d; Colum&#x2019;s voice was a quick whisper. &#x201c;Last time was unlucky, isn&#x2019;t it? Whole season unlucky. Fuckers this season are on the ropes. Inevitable. Fuckers home in an ambulance. Been lucky. Got a destiny that&#x2019;s not what they think, to be sure.&#x201d;</p><p>Chance and fate, Dan had started to see, were a great pre-occupation of guys engaged in reckless deeds. He didn&#x2019;t trust Colum to do a good job. Didn&#x2019;t trust him to keep his mouth shut after. It was exhausting to think of all the ways he didn&#x2019;t trust him and why had they been paired together? Dawson kept telling Dan he&#x2019;d be able to work soon with Patrick. Kept telling him Patrick was too well known to the authorities now&#x2014;couldn&#x2019;t be the face of operations, only the brains, needed help. Dawson kept saying Dan and Patrick would make a great team one day, but here he was, teamed with Colum Allen, talking football.</p><p>&#x201c;Agree with sacking Steiny? How could a man. How could. But a man gets no silverwear for the Celtic, his history is history, isn&#x2019;t it? Fuckers got short memories is what they&#x2019;ve got. Anyway&#x2014;&#x201d; he coughed&#x2014;&#x201c;this your debut, is it?&#x201d;</p><p>Dan stood for a moment to grant some relief to his legs, then went back to crouching and squinting. Occasional shapes animated the gloom at the end of the alley. Occasional voices too. There was advance word of RUC raids happening here tonight. The idea was for Dan and Colum to disrupt the raids as much as possible. They had gear on the ground in two zipped bags.</p><p>Nerves. When Dan was nervous he didn&#x2019;t gibber or fiddle with his hands like Colum. Instead, basic questions surfaced. Such as: What am I doing here? Or: Will I end up with a bullet in my brain? Another cool wind was picking up grit. They waited.</p><p>&#x201c;Paddy&#x2019;s your man, is he?&#x201d;</p><p>Dan was silent. Disconcerting to think a guy as simple as Colum could have a read on your thoughts.</p><p>&#x201c;Internment, was he?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; Dan said. &#x201c;I think so.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Whole year?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No idea.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Two?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Dunno.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Fuckers keep their secrets.&#x201d;</p><p>He knew exactly how long Patrick had been interned by the Brits without trial. But he&#x2019;d also learned that it was unwise to give your facts away for free. Sharing less&#x2014;sometimes less than was decent&#x2014;made the other person uncomfortable. In an uncomfortable silence, people gave you more of themselves. The RUC had apparently come at dawn to pick Patrick up. The whine of the Saracens, bulky six-wheeled monsters, being slipped into a low gear. A dimmed stage, dark vehicles, blackened faces, not unlike the expected scene tonight; the occasional white blotch from a Catholic paint bomb. The whole of your life in Belfast was organised around light and dark, visibility and invisibility, silence and sound, information and secrecy, the private rubbing up against the public and making you feel tired. None of this Dan said to Colum.</p><p>&#x201c;Heard about your initiation,&#x201d; Colum said. &#x201c;Aye. The dogs. That one&#x2019;s getting nice and famous. Though I expect he was only preparing Your Majesty for obstacles others might raise.&#x201d;</p><p>Don&#x2019;t give in, Dan thought. But he gave in. &#x201c;What did you hear?&#x201d;</p><p>Colum grinned and scratched his neck, staring at the ground as if it were the future. &#x201c;Other option, course, is he just wanted to give you nightmares. Dawson McCartland&#x2019;s nice like that. Fuckers love a good nightmare.&#x201d; He clicked his fingers. &#x201c;My first time? They gave me a gun and an address and that was that.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I won&#x2019;t be doing any of that stuff.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;House calls.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Ha,&#x201d; Colum said, and allowed himself an unusual pause. &#x201c;Demoralises the police, stiffing them at home. Shows all the other police there&#x2019;s no place that&#x2019;s their own to relax, they said. Hadn&#x2019;t even occurred. I was even younger than you, probably. I was seventeen. So I&#x2019;m realising quick I&#x2019;m going to have to get a ride into an Orangies&#x2019; area. And I&#x2019;m realising a certain amount of planning needs to be done for the runback, though I&#x2019;ve got only a day to do it. So the day comes and I&#x2019;m wearing a Rangers badge, right? Though it kills me, so it does. And I&#x2019;m wearing a pair of Beatle boots I got hold of from a fat lad. And all the while they&#x2019;re not telling me much about this guy I&#x2019;m going to stiff or any real advice, tips if you will, but I&#x2019;m used to that, aren&#x2019;t I? Grandfather used to be an Ulster fiddler, a virtuoso in Donegal&#x2014;really. Took an awful reddener when he forgot his music one day. None of those fiddler men would let you in on their performance practices, no way; that&#x2019;s what I&#x2019;m sayin&#x2019;. It&#x2019;s a similar thing. So anyway, I go and stiff the guy and his wife comes screaming into the hall, looking at the pool of blood. Cool as anything I was. Just did the thing and left.&#x201d;</p><p>Dan nodded. &#x201c;Sure.&#x201d; People were always heroes in their own telling.</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; Colum said. &#x201c;It was only once I got back to my district and had my first pint that the whole thing went right up on me. Shaking all over I was. Been shaking mostly ever since.&#x201d;</p><p>He had Dan&#x2019;s attention now. Night clouds moved across the moon. In a brief breeze an empty can rolled towards them and Colum&#x2019;s shoulders did a jump. They laughed.</p><p>A whining sound. A few thin flickers of light. Colum got up. &#x201c;Here we go,&#x201d; he said, newly hard in the face, oddly impressive-looking. He picked up the bags. They ran to the end of the alley.</p><p>&#x201c;Wait.&#x201d;</p><p>Dan did as he was told. The black Saracens were creeping along the Falls, slow and certain. The walls flanking this section of the road were painted black, a mass redaction of the murals of Bobby Sands and other heroes. The sound of heavy boots. Foot patrols moving behind and alongside the Saracens. Even if Colum had brought his gun with him, there was no way you could see the men well enough to snipe them. All of the officers were wearing black. Anything else would have spoiled the decor.</p><p>They watched as two RUC men broke down the first door to a Catholic home. The groan of the wood giving in. Dan&#x2019;s heart going hard. In the first open bag a dozen plastic bottles. Each of them was three-quarters full with white paint and water. &#x201c;Quick now,&#x201d; Colum said. They scrambled to unscrew five or six lids. In another bag they had waterproof sheeting tied around chunks of dry ice. They started squeaking fragments of dry ice into the open bottles of paint, screwing the lids back on. Colum slapped Dan&#x2019;s face. &#x201c;Quick, I said.&#x201d; Running.</p><p>Out into the open road. They got alongside the Saracens, a taste of smoke in the air, a soulful adrenalin building. A woman dragged out onto the street was saying &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you touch the inside of my house!&#x201d; Men from the foot patrol were running into her home and another man, lank and stooped in the dim of the moon, had his hand around the woman&#x2019;s mouth. Colum hurled the first bottle. The lazy grace of it in the air and the little crackle and pop as it hit bodywork and exploded. Better than when they&#x2019;d rehearsed. Perfect. White paint sprawling out on the Saracen, white paint dripping and pooling. Dan hurled two bottles. His blood was swaying. Hurt to breathe. Neither exploded. He needed to throw them harder, higher. Colum was shouting &#x201c;Pots and pans! Pots and pans!&#x201d; without a single tremor in his voice.</p><p>Dan went to ground, grit in his elbows, and pressed more fragments of dry ice into bottles. He sprinted, the bags banging on his shoulders, and threw a bottle at an RUC man&#x2014;missed&#x2014;but then one of Colum&#x2019;s bottles looped and the man&#x2019;s uniform was half white and the man yelled, fell. Another Saracen backing up to the front door of the next Catholic home to be searched and torn apart. Another throw. Dan was screaming &#x201c;Pots! Pots! Pots!&#x201d; and like magic windows were opening all down the street. Colum must have lobbed another bottle high&#x2014;Dan could see it coming down almost at a vertical&#x2014;and paint exploded over the roof of a Saracen. A precision hit. He&#x2019;d got Colum all wrong. Loved the man in this moment. Loved him. Catholic women were leaning out of windows banging pots and pans. The whole street waking up and making noise, ensuring others rose and joined. Don&#x2019;t let these men rip our floorboards up. Don&#x2019;t let them call our freedom fighters terrorists. Some of the women were throwing glass bottles stuffed with burning hankies towards the blotches of white, tiny bursts of fire near the targets, three and then six and then more. Other women were in the street in nighties. They were standing in the way of the Saracens and banging their pots and pans above their heads, shouting &#x201c;Put the fires out if you like! Go on then!&#x201d; Shouting &#x201c;What&#x2019;s a taste of water then? Give us a shower!&#x201d; All this as Dan ran into another dark alley, the last of his bottles used up, changing into clean clothes and beginning the long jog home.</p><p>In training he tried to show that he was hungry for knowledge. There seemed to be an infinite supply. There was more artistry to violence than he&#x2019;d ever expected, more technique and philosophy. Months rolled by with only paint-bomb operations. Less a war than an apprenticeship&#x2014;someone finally taking him under their wing. They told him they thought his future was bright.</p><p>In a warehouse space that smelt of raw meat they taught him how to open and split a shotgun cartridge. They taught him that candle wax in the tip made it hold together on impact. Mercury in the cartridge made it more deadly. Garlic pur�e in the cartridge put poison in the blood. They taught him to smear axle grease on a bullet to make it fly through reinforced doors. They taught him to pack cartridges with rice to slow them down. They showed him all the things you could do with the looped brake cable of a pushbike. A knife in a body needs to be twisted upward. Bulletproof glass has a blue-green glint. If a friend&#x2019;s car is stolen, call Sinn Fein on this number. If a friend&#x2019;s family is persecuted, call Sinn Fein on that number. Golf courses are for golf and the storage of weapons. Some people relax by emptying magazine after magazine into oil drums, tree stumps, the tyres of abandoned cars; others prefer the cold sophistication of invention, electrics, tricks with cassette-recorder parts.

She lives in Princeton, New Jersey."It was between the ages of thirteen and seventeen that I belonged to FOXFIRE and FOXFIRE made sacred those years." Madeleine Faith Wirtz narrates Oates's 22nd novel in first-person promiscuous, chronicling intimately the violent comings and goings of a communard and her female teenaged outfit: Foxfire, a gang set up in smalltown, upstate Hammond, N.Y., during the 1950s. Maddy and her four cohorts find strength in numbers. Together they assault and kill, their main victims being adult men who have have exploited them. The novel is written years afterward from the vantage point of skeptical adulthood when Maddy has gone respectable and looks over the notebooks she had kept during her Foxfire days. In the course of reminiscing, Maddy recovers the group's ardor, the sense of oppression and reckless abandon, and then tempers it. The novel is true to Oates and her oeuvre, revisiting some of the themes of her earliest work--female delinquency and survival--while seeking to expand the canvas into a group portrait. The author grittily evokes the hectic, heated power surges of self-taught feminist anarchists; in her prose she walks a delicate line between the raw and the literary, the wildly ignorant and the wisely knowing.

People like Mark Cuban, John Paul DeJoria, Sara Blakely, and T. Boone Pickens all built businesses&#x2014;in some cases, multiple businesses&#x2014;that are among today&#x2019;s most iconic brands. This fact raises two profound questions: Why couldn&#x2019;t their former employers hang on to to these extraordinarily talented people? And why are most big companies unable to create as much new value as the world&#x2019;s roughly 800 self-made billionaires?</p><p>John Sviokla and Mitch Cohen decided to look more closely at self-made billionaires because creating $1 billion or more in value is an incredible feat. Drawing on extensive research and interviews, the authors concluded that many of the myths perpetuated about billionaires are simply not true. These billionaires aren&#x2019;t necessarily smarter, harder working, or luckier than their peers. They aren&#x2019;t all prodigies, crossing the billionaire finish line in their twenties. Nor, most of the time, do they create something brand-new: More than 80 percent of the billionaires in the research sample earned their billions in highly competitive industries.</p><p>The key difference is what the authors call the &#x201c;Producer&#x201d; mind-set, in contrast with the far more pervasive &#x201c;Performer&#x201d; mind-set. Performers strive to excel in well-defined areas, and are important. But Producers are critical to any company looking to create massive value because they redefine what&#x2019;s possible, rather than simply meeting preexisting goals and standards. Combining sound judgment with imaginative vision, Producers think up entirely new products, services, strategies, and business models.</p><p>Big companies tend to reward Performers and discourage the unconventional ways of Producers. But it&#x2019;s the latter who integrate multiple ideas, perspectives, and actions, and who trust their insights enough to make game-changing bets.<br><br> This book breaks down the five critical habits of mind of massive value-creators, so you can learn how to identify, encourage, and retain such individuals&#x2014;and maybe even become one yourself. <i>The Self-made Billionaire Effect</i> will forever change the way you think about talent and business value.</p></p><p><b>JOHN SVIOKLA</b>&nbsp;is head of Global Thought Leadership at PwC (PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP).

What might Steve Case have done for PepsiCo if he had decided to stay rather than join the gaming start-up that would eventually become AOL? Would Redken have been the first hair care brand to explode the market for salon-quality hair products if John Paul Mitchell Systems cofounder John Paul DeJoria had not been fired for his unconventional sales leadership style? Would Miles Laboratories have succeeded if it had pursued the idea posed by Michael Jaharis, then a young lawyer in its ranks, to proactively brand and market acetaminophen years before Tylenol became a household name? What if Salomon Brothers had kept Michael Bloomberg, or Bear Stearns had exploited the inventive ideas of Stephen Ross?</p><p>Jobs, Case, DeJoria, Jaharis, Bloomberg, and Ross, as well as Broadcast.com founder Mark Cuban, Celtel founder Mo Ibrahim, oil-and-gas magnate T. Boone Pickens, and scores of other extreme entrepreneurs all worked for established corporations before they struck out on their own. Some fled corporate constraints. Others were pushed out. Each one became a self-made billionaire. They all built businesses&#x2014;in some cases multiple businesses&#x2014;that are among the most iconic brands today. The influence of these and the roughly eight hundred other living self-made billionaires is so widespread that few people anywhere in the world can go a day without using, seeing, or in some way encountering the products and services they have created.</p><p>But what might their former employers have become if these exceptional value creators had decided to pursue and produce their ideas inside the organizations? Put a different way, why aren&#x2019;t existing corporations able to create massive value the way these self-made billionaires have? In so many cases, large corporations had the literal talent necessary do so&#x2014;the self-made billionaires worked for them.</p><p>That latter question is top of mind for today&#x2019;s business leaders&#x2014;smart, experienced, successful managers who are seeing their organizations pushed to the limits by rapid change. In today&#x2019;s environment all the base assumptions of how to build and sustain value are constantly in flux: What makes for efficient scale? Who are our competitors? Who are our customers? What do they want? Who owns what? Where is the risk? In a recent CEO survey conducted by PwC, more than half of the respondents predicted they would need to change their strategy either incrementally or wholesale in the coming years. Nearly 70 percent of those same respondents said they were concerned about talent issues, and 25 percent did not pursue a clear opportunity in the past year because they <i>believed</i> they didn&#x2019;t have the talent to take advantage of it.1 The fact that so many self-made billionaires held managerial positions in midsize to large firms before striking out on their own suggests that the survey respondents just might be wrong about this issue. They have the talent but haven&#x2019;t taken the time to identify or nurture it.</p><p>Taken together, these responses make clear that business leaders are uncertain about how to tackle the particular challenge of continually creating value in today&#x2019;s environment. Throughout their careers these leaders have taken care to cultivate and promote managers with sound judgment&#x2014;that celebrated ability to see the world as it is and to make smart, strategic decisions based on reality. Judgment works best when the rules of the game are well established, when the variables are known. But what do you do in a changing world where the variables keep shifting?</p><p>To answer that question we decided to look more closely at the leaders and the businesses that have thrived in our era of constant change. Despite the challenges of the day, despite the apparent mismatch between available skills and huge opportunities, there is a group of people creating value at an explosive pace and scale&#x2014;<i>self-made</i><b> </b>billionaires. We defined self-made billionaires as those individuals who create wealth of more than $1 billion through entrepreneurial activity; even those who inherited some financial resources or an existing business can qualify as self-made if they expand the value of that resource on the order of 100X or more.</p><p>In 2012, there were more than eight hundred self-made billionaires worldwide; they made up more than two thirds of the total billionaire population.2 Overall, billionaire wealth has grown faster than the world economy, more than tripling from 2 percent to 7 percent of GDP between 1987 and 2012.</p><p>Why did we focus on self-made billionaires? Because creating a billion dollars or more in value is an incredible feat. If you have discipline and you work hard, you can become a top-notch accountant or a lawyer. Years of dedication and a little luck might propel you to partner status at PwC or a law firm, or perhaps into the C-suite at a Fortune 500 firm. Do that and you will likely achieve multimillionaire status, but your chances of becoming a billionaire along that path are almost zero. There are clear paths to wealth, but there is no tried-and-true road to megawealth. Billionaires have to do something extraordinary to make it as far as they do. Good luck plays a role, but luck will only allow a million-dollar idea to bring in a million dollars&#x2019; worth of value. Becoming a billionaire requires luck <i>and</i> a great deal more.</p><p>Self-made billionaires thrive in an environment of shifting variables. Take Dietrich Mateschitz, the founder of Red Bull, who has generated cultish devotion for a drink that even devoted fans agree tastes like cough syrup. Or Sara Blakely, a fax saleswoman/stand-up comic, who had the all-too-common problem of visible panty lines under her white pants. Spanx, the hosiery company she created to make the product she wanted, earned accolades from self-made billionaire tastemaker Oprah Winfrey and generated explosive growth in an era when hosiery stalwarts were seeing their revenues plummet. Or Joe Mansueto, the soft-spoken founder of Morningstar, who at the age of twenty-three was forced to sift through dozens of mutual fund prospectuses in order to manage his fledgling personal investment portfolio. Surrounded by piles of paper, he thought, &#x201c;Gee, this could be a business.&#x201d; Mateschitz, Blakely, Mansueto, and hundreds of others&#x2014;these are the people creating hugely profitable businesses in today&#x2019;s world.</p><p>When we looked more closely at self-made billionaires, we found that sound judgment was not in short supply. These are people who have dealt with the world as it is, made excruciating choices, and placed bets based on hard realities. But what truly makes them stand out is that their judgment is balanced by extraordinary imaginative vision.</p><p>Cultivating a balance of judgment and vision is a challenging task. Findings from neuroscience suggest that for most people, judgment and imagination sit on opposite ends of a mental spectrum. The more skilled one is at seeing things as they are (judgment) the harder it is to see things as they might be (imagination).3 But somehow, the population of self-made billionaires manages to defeat the binary mental spectrum that places judgment and imagination in opposition to each other.</p><p>The tactics and habits we identified that allow self-made billionaires to achieve that balance are the core of this book. They suggest practices that companies and individuals can adopt to enhance their value-creation capabilities.</p><p>So what is the source of the self-made billionaire effect? What allows them to create such massive value? How do they rise above the apparent trade-off between judgment and imagination? What other skills, habits, life experiences, or talents distinguish them from the pack? And most important, what can these insights teach us about the talent we as executives need to find and cultivate in order to thrive in challenging times?</p><p>We begin to answer these questions in Chapter 1, where we present our foundational findings on what makes self-made billionaires different from the average corporate executive. The findings not only surprised us, they also changed the way we think about executive talent and what we need to look for in the talent we bring into business and nurture.</p><p></p><p></p><p>1</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>EXPLODING MYTHS OF EXTREME ENTREPRENEURSHIP</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function.</p><p>&#x2014;F. SCOTT FITZGERALD</p><p>In 1984, Dietrich Mateschitz was a bored, forty-year-old marketing executive at the German cosmetics company Blendax. He spent his days peddling toothpaste and cosmetics to retailers around the world. &#x201c;All I could see was the same grey airplanes, the same grey suits, the same grey faces. All the hotel bars looked the same, and so did the women in them. I asked myself whether I wanted to spend the next decade as I&#x2019;d spent the previous one.&#x201d; 1 Then on a routine trip to Thailand&#x2014;like dozens of others he had taken&#x2014;Mateschitz had an insight that would change his career.</p><p>While reading the newspaper one morning at his hotel, Mateschitz learned that the Japanese manufacturer of a line of supersweet &#x201c;health&#x201d; drinks popular in Asia was the biggest taxpayer in Japan. Mateschitz knew the drinks and had taken them for the energy boost they gave as an antidote to jet lag. There was nothing like them in the West. That they were a huge moneymaker had never occurred to Mateschitz, and he decided right then to quit his job and start a company to manufacture and market the drinks in Europe.</p><p>Within a few years, Red Bull, the business Mateschitz founded with Thai business associate Chaleo Yoovidhya&#x2014;a toothpaste manufacturer who also had a sideline in beverages&#x2014;had launched its signature carbonated beverage in Mateschitz&#x2019;s native Austria and in Slovenia. Within a decade Red Bull was in the UK, Germany, and eventually in the enormous beverage market in the United States. In all of the markets it entered, Red Bull became an almost overnight sensation. Red Bull was the first in what became, during the 1990s and 2000s, a burgeoning market of &#x201c;energy&#x201d; drinks, a beverage category that is neither a sports drink like Gatorade nor an amped-up soda like Mountain Dew. Red Bull charged through as a supersweet, caffeine-infused carbonated beverage that merged the appeal of sweet sodas and extreme sports into something entirely new: a drink that &#x201c;gives you wings.&#x201d; Mateschitz redesigned the beverage to be a carbonated, less concentrated version of the syrupy shots he was inspired by, and he redesigned the traditional soda can as an eight-ounce bullet shape that signaled to the buyer that this was not just another cola.</p><p>Today, Red Bull is far more than the drink that carries its name. It is a media company; a Formula 1 franchise; a Nascar franchise; a sponsor of mountain climbers and skiers and other extreme sportsmen; a &#x201c;philosophy,&#x201d; as its founder has said, of life lived in a heightened state of adrenaline-fused activity&#x2014;all bred from the modest foundations of a good idea.2</p><p>HOW ARE BILLIONAIRES DIFFERENT?</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The story of how Dietrich Mateschitz built his brand empire reads on the surface like many examples of extreme entrepreneurial success&#x2014;there is the serendipitous moment of revelation, the useful connections to the right people, the willingness to risk his career on an uncertain venture. Yet not every insight, every business connection, every risk taken results in a billion dollars of value. That success is not evenly distributed across the range of good ideas made us ask the question that lies at the root of this book: namely, what enables self-made billionaires to create such massive value?</p><p>There are plenty of available truisms that get touted by thought leaders in response to that question. Extreme entrepreneurs take bigger risks, for example, or they focus on new markets. We didn&#x2019;t know at the outset whether any of these ideas were true, but on their own they didn&#x2019;t seem to explain the scale of success that these people achieve. Many people take risks, but very few reap high returns. Many entrepreneurs launch into new growth markets, but few emerge with a blockbuster hit.</p><p>The answer, we decided, was more complex. To find it, we first decided to dig deeper into the business literature to find what business scholars have to say from studying self-made billionaires. We expected to find a strong base of academic research focused on identifying the behaviors, characteristics, and secrets of success of self-made billionaires. What we found surprised us&#x2014;in fact, no one had done a systematic study of self-made billionaires. We found plenty of isolated stories and first-person narratives culled from magazine profiles and autobiographies. But there have been only a few attempts at systematic evaluation of entrepreneurial success at any scale, and those evaluations often come to contradictory conclusions.3</p><p>Quickly it became clear that if we wanted answers, we would need to look for them ourselves. Ultimately, that was a good thing&#x2014;we didn&#x2019;t have to contend with prior research making strong conclusions that might influence our thinking.</p><p>We set up a research team in early 2012 at PwC, where Mitch is a vice chairman and John is the leader of Global Thought Leadership. To identify our research subjects, we took the 2012 <i>Forbes</i> list &#x201c;The World&#x2019;s Billionaires&#x201d; and eliminated people who had inherited their wealth from a parent, a spouse, or other family member. We also removed billionaires operating in markets that lack the regulatory transparency to ensure fair play&#x2014;all billionaires take advantage of economic conditions, but we chose to focus on those operating in environments where reasonably transparent and competitive markets predominate.4</p><p>Left with roughly 600 people, we randomly selected 120, adjusted to mirror the geographic and industry distribution of the larger sample, and set out to learn as much as we could about them. We collected everything we could find that had been written about our subjects and captured biographical details (place of origin, age, marital status, family makeup) and the trajectory of their careers (When did they start their first business?

I was to meet Ron Alexenburg, the head of Aegis Records, and my manager, Carol Ross, at Newark Airport to catch a flight to Chicago. The band had already gone ahead, and we were all pretty excited about starting the nineties off with a new project. A host of radio stations and press were going to be there. Because Chicago had launched so many of our past successes, it seemed the perfect city to begin our tour. As my wife, Lynda, and I were about to leave, the phone suddenly rang. I was in a rush and kind of annoyed when I answered. It was my accountant, Howard Comart. In a very subdued voice he said, &#x201c;Morris is asking for you. If you want to see him you&#x2019;d better get up here right away.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh my God, Howard, I&#x2019;m dashing out the door to do a show in Chicago. I&#x2019;ll be back first thing tomorrow morning and I&#x2019;ll come right up.&#x201d; There was a pause. Howard said, &#x201c;Well, okay.&#x201d; But there was a tremor in his voice. I gave him my hotel number in Chicago and told him to keep me posted.<br> <br>When I got to the airport, I told Ron and Carol the situation, and it cast a shadow over our otherwise joyful morning. The Godfather of the music business, Morris Levy, was dying of cancer. We all had a feeling of disbelief because none of us had ever thought of Morris as anything but invincible. In his sixty-two years, he had created and controlled one of the biggest independent music publishing companies; managed and was partners with the most famous rock and roll disc jockey, Alan Freed; owned the most famous jazz club in history, Birdland; and owned one of the most successful independent record labels of the fifties and sixties, Roulette Records, which also was my record label for eight years.<br> <br>Morris and I had been exchanging messages through Howard, our mutual accountant, for several weeks, almost like two kids passing notes back and forth in school. I knew he understood how saddened I was by the whole thing and that despite everything, I genuinely cared about him.<br> <br>When we got off the plane at O&#x2019;Hare, I was suddenly filled with the old excitement; a sold-out show, in Chicago, to promote a new record. It felt good to feel this again twenty-four years after first signing with Morris and Roulette. Our road manager met us at baggage claim, a limo was waiting outside, and we loaded up and headed for the hotel. The rest of the day went pretty smoothly, the sound check and all the backstage stuff. But all I kept thinking about was Morris. Lynda kept checking our messages at the hotel hourly.<br> <br>The show went great; the audience went crazy, dancing in the aisles, standing on their seats screaming for more. We played a combination of the hits and the new stuff, but even on stage I was preoccupied. We ended the show with &#x201c;Mony Mony,&#x201d; like we had done ten thousand times, and did the usual encore. Like always I was hot, sweaty, and out of breath when I came off stage. Carol and Ron met me by the stage door and we all walked back to the dressing room. I had an interview to do with a young radio guy from a local pop station. There was a lot of whooping and hollering around me as I sat down to catch my breath in front of the dressing room mirror. The DJ started asking me questions and I could see the cassette player rolling. The interview had begun. I started off with how great it was to be back in Chicago, then Lynda suddenly came into the room holding a piece of paper. She said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry to interrupt, Tommy, but Morris Levy died.&#x201d;<br> <br>There was just silence. All day long I had been thinking about what I was going to say to him, and now I&#x2019;d never get the chance. I&#x2019;d heard stories of how emaciated he had become and had imagined what I would feel seeing him like that, but it didn&#x2019;t matter now because I would never see him again.<br> <br>At that point my interviewer said, &#x201c;Excuse me, Tommy, can I ask you a question?&#x201d; I nodded and he said, &#x201c;Who is Morris Levy?&#x201d;<br> <br>Wow, who is Morris Levy? I looked at him in astonishment and realized this kid couldn&#x2019;t be more than twenty-one or twenty-two years old.<br> <br>&#x201c;How much time do we have?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;As much time as you want. I came for an in-depth interview.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, you&#x2019;re going to get one. Is that tape recorder still running?&#x201d;<br> <br>� 2010 Tommy James</p><h2>The Secret Founding of America: The Real Story of Freemasons, Puritans, &amp; the Battle for The New World</h2><p>Ask most Americans where the country&#x2019;s origins lie and they&#x2019;ll point to the Mayflower and its settlers whom we often think of as the earliest arrivals to our shores. But something existed even before that: Jamestown. Its founders had thoroughly different values than the Puritans, and their Masonic beliefs indelibly shaped America&#x2019;s future. This authoritative, accessible, and absorbing history takes a fresh look at the past to reveal the truth about why the United States is now run by Freemasons who are Christians, too. Drawing on original findings, and exhibiting a rich, in-depth understanding of the political and philosophical realities of the time, acclaimed author Nicholas Hagger argues that the new nation, conceived in liberty, was the Freemasons&#x2019; first step towards a new world order. He charts the connections between secret societies and libertarian ideals, explains how the influence of German Illuminati worked on the framers of the new republic, and shows the hand of Freemasonry at work at every turning point in America&#x2019;s history from the Civil War to the Cold War to today&#x2019;s global struggles for democracy. It&#x2019;s a fascinating subject, and one that will also be at the center of Dan Brown&#x2019;s next book so interest is sure to be high and the tie-in potential immense.</p><p>Nicholas Hagger has lectured at universities in Baghdad, Tokyo, and Tripoli (Libya); written for the London Times; and written more than 20 books of history, literature and philosophy, including a study of the founding, rise and fall of civilizations. He has appeared frequently on television and radio and in newspapers, speaking on the founding of America.

It is an atmosphere ripe for scandal&#x2014;but even Jane is unprepared for the shocking drama that unfolds. A flamboyant French beauty, known for her brazen behavior, is found gruesomely strangled in a shabby chaise. While many urge the arrest of a known scoundrel with eyes for the victim, Jane looks further afield and finds a number of acquaintances behaving oddly.<br><br>As rumors spread like wildfire that Napoleon's fleet is bound for Kent, Jane suspects that the murder was an act of war rather than a crime of passion. Suddenly the peaceful fields of Kent are a very dangerous place...and Jane's thirst for justice may exact the steepest price of all&#x2014;her life.</p><p>Serious scholars might disagree, but it seems to at least one amateur Austenite that Stephanie Barron has captured Jane Austen's voice perfectly in her scrupulously researched and scrumptuously written mysteries starring the celebrated English novelist. "There are not many uses for a baronet's daughter, but the steady management of a gentleman's household may safely be described as one of them," Barron writes in the fourth book in this remarkable series, a line that could have been plucked from anywhere in the actual canon. Jane is talking about her sister-in-law Elizabeth, who runs her brother Edward's Godmersham estate in Kent. It's here that Jane comes for a visit in the summer of 1805--and gets caught up not only in a murder mystery but the planned invasion of England by Napoleon, which ended in the Battle of Trafalgar.<p> Austen, of course, had all the qualities of a good detective: the superb attention to detail, fervid imagination, and salty disdain for pretension. Barron makes excellent use of these attributes, plopping Jane Poirot-like into the middle of a crime at the Canterbury Races, then surrounding her with mysterious and possibly sinister figures involved in aiding or thwarting Napoleon's plans.</p><p> The writing, as stylized as it is ("There is nothing like the country for the rapid communication of what is dreadful"), never gets in the way of Barron's carefully plotted story, and in the end most readers will find they've managed to satisfy their appetites both for Austen and for mystery. First-timers will be delighted to hear that the three earlier books in Barron's series (<i>Jane and the Unpleasantness at Scargrave Manor</i>, <i>Jane and the Man of the Cloth</i>, and <i>Jane and the Wandering Eye</i>) are available in paperback. <i>--Dick Adler</i></p>FOR EVERYONE WHO LOVES JANE AUSTEN...

Pyramid-shaped mounds of rock and talus were piled under them, and rotten wooden boards lay half drowned in this debris.</p><p>I looked closer and saw that the caves were square, and one appeared to be propped with beams. These weren&#x2019;t caves at all. They were mine entrances.</p><p>It now made sense. The valley floor had that ragged and hard-used look common to many other pieces of wilderness in the American West that had been rich in gold or silver in the nineteenth century. A braiding of trails was etched into the dirt, and the slabs of an abandoned stone cabin and shattered lengths of metal pipe were down there, too, now almost obscured in the dusk. The place had been devoured quickly and then spat out, with a midden of antique garbage left behind.</p><p>What kind of ore had been carted away from here? Curiosity got the better of me, and I wandered over to a spot down the trail where three other people had also set up camp. They were recent college graduates from Salt Lake City on a spring camping trip. After offering me a beer from their cooler, they told me the holes on the cliff were of much more recent origin than I had thought. Uranium mines had been drilled in southern Utah after World War II, and the mineral had gone into nuclear weapons. This was common knowledge around southern Utah.</p><p><i>Uranium.</i> The name seemed magical, and vaguely unsettling. I remembered the boxy periodic table of the elements, where uranium was signified by the letter <i>U.</i> It was fairly high up the scale, meaning there were a lot of small particles called protons clustered in its nucleus. So it was heavy. It was also used to generate nuclear power. I remembered that much from high school science. But it had never quite registered with me that a mineral lying in the crust of the earth&#x2014;just a special kind of dirt, really&#x2014;was the home of one of the most violent forces under human control. A paradox there: <i>from dust to dust</i>. The earth came seeded with the means of its own destruction, a geologic original sin.</p><p>There was something personal here, too. I had grown up in the 1980s in Tucson, Arizona, a city ringed with Titan II missiles. One of those warheads was lodged in a concrete silo and surrounded by a square of barbed wire in the desert about twenty miles north of my high school. It was nearly five hundred times as powerful as the bomb that leveled Hiroshima. Our city was supposed to have been number seven on the Soviet target list, behind Washington, D.C.; the Strategic Air Command headquarters in Omaha, Nebraska; and several other missile fields in the Great Plains. I lived through my adolescence with the understanding that an irreconcilable crisis with Moscow would mean my family and I would be vaporized in white light, and there might be less than ten minutes&#x2019; warning to say good-bye (the brief window of foreknowledge seemed more terrible than the vaporizing). Like most every other American of that day, I subsumed this possibility and went about my business. There could be no other choice; to dwell on the idea for very long was like looking at the sun.</p><p>And now, here I was in a spot that had given up the mineral that had haunted the world for more than half a century. The mouths in the canyon walls at Temple Mountain looked as prosaic as they would have at any other mining operation. They also happened to be in the midst of some of the most gorgeous American landscape I know: the dry and crenulated Colorado Plateau, which spreads across portions of four states in a pinkish-red maze of canyons, sagebrush plains, and crumbling pinnacles that, in places, looks like a Martian vista. This, too, was an intriguing paradox: radioactive treasure in a phantasm landscape. The desert had birthed an awful power.</p><p>After my trip, I plunged into the library and wrote an article for a history magazine about the uranium rush of the 1950s, when the government paid out bonuses to ordinary prospectors to comb the deserts for the basic fuel of the nuclear arms race. But my fascination with uranium did not end, even years after that night I slept under the cliff ruins. In the present decade, as the United States has gone to war in Iraq on the premise of keeping uranium out of the wrong hands&#x2014;and as tensions mount in Iran over that nation&#x2019;s plan to enrich the fatal ore&#x2014;I realized that I still knew almost nothing about this one entry in the periodic table that had so drastically reordered the global hierarchy after World War II and continued to amplify some of the darker pulls of humanity: greed, vanity, xenophobia, arrogance, and a certain suicidal glee.</p><p>I had to relearn some basic matters of science, long forgotten since college. I knew that the nuclear trick comes from the &#x201c;splitting&#x201d; of an atom and the consequent release of energy. But why not copper or oxygen or coffee grounds or orange peels or anything else? Why does this feat require a rare version of uranium, known as U-235, that must be distilled, or &#x201c;enriched,&#x201d; from raw uranium?</p><p>I started reading again about the infinitesimally small particles called neutrons and protons packed at the center, or nucleus, of atoms, and the negatively charged particles called electrons that whiz around the nucleus like bees around a hive. Puncture that nucleus, and the electrical energy that bound it together would flash outward in a killing wave. U-235 is uniquely vulnerable to this kind of injury, and I understood this in concept but could not really visualize it until I came across a line written by the physicist Otto Frisch. He described this particular nucleus as a &#x201c;wobbling, unstable drop ready to divide itself at the slightest provocation.&#x201d; That image finally brought it home: the basic principle of the atomic bomb.</p><p>A uranium atom is simply built too large. It is the heaviest element that occurs in nature, with ninety-two protons jammed into its nucleus. This approaches a boundary of physical tolerance. The heart of uranium, its nucleus, is an aching knot held together with electrical coils that are as fragile as sewing thread&#x2014;more fragile than in any other atom that occurs in nature. Just the pinprick of an invading neutron can rip the whole package apart with hideous force. The subatomic innards of U-235 spray outward like the shards of a grenade; these fragments burst the skins of neighboring uranium nuclei, and the effect blossoms exponentially, shattering a trillion trillion atoms within the space of one orgiastic second. A single atom of uranium is strong enough to twitch a grain of sand. A sphere of it the size of a grapefruit can eliminate a city.</p><p>There are other dangers. A uranium atom is so overloaded that it has begun to cast off pieces of itself, as a deluded man might tear off his clothes. In a frenzy to achieve a state of rest, it slings off a missile of two protons and two neutrons at a velocity fast enough to whip around the circumference of the earth in roughly two seconds. This is the simplest form of radioactivity, deadly in high doses. These bullets can tear through living tissue and poke holes in healthy cell tissue, making the tissue vulnerable to genetic errors and cancer.</p><p>Losing its center piece by piece, uranium changes shape as it loses its protons&#x2014;it becomes radium and then radon and then polonium&#x2014;a lycanthropic cascade that involves thirteen heavy metals before the stuff finally comes to permanent rest as lead. More than 4.5 billion years must pass before half of any given sample decays. Seething anger is locked inside uranium, but the ore is stable and can be picked up and carried around safely as long as its dust is not inhaled. &#x201c;Hell, I&#x2019;d shovel some of it into my pillow and sleep on it at night&#x201d; is a common saying among miners.</p><p>Only when the ore has been concentrated to more than 20 percent U-235&#x2014;which is, thankfully, a job of massive industrial proportions&#x2014;is there the danger of a spontaneous chain reaction. But after that point, it becomes frighteningly simple. Two lumps of enriched uranium slammed together with great force: This is the crude simplicity of the atomic bomb. (A similar effect can be achieved through the compression of plutonium, a by-product of uranium fission that is covered only briefly in this book.)</p><p>Though uranium&#x2019;s lethal powers have been known for less than seventy years, man has been tinkering with it at least since the time of Christ. Traces of it have been found as tinting inside stained-glass mosaics of the Roman Empire. Indians in the American Southwest used the colorful yellow soil as an additive in body paint and religious art. Bohemian peasants found a vein of it in the lower levels of a silver mine at the end of the Dark Ages. They considered it a nuisance and nicknamed it &#x201c;bad-luck rock,&#x201d; throwing it aside. The waste piles lay there in the forest until the beginning of the twentieth century, when chemists in France and Britain started buying uranium at a deep discount for the first experiments on radioactivity. A West Virginia company briefly used the stuff as a red dye for a line of dishes known as Fiesta Ware. But it was not until the late 1930s when an ominous realization began to dawn among a handful of scientists in European and American universities: that the overburdened nucleus of U-235 was just on the edge of cracking asunder and might be broken with a single neutron.</p><p>This was the insight behind America&#x2019;s Manhattan Project, which brought a startling ending to World War II and initiated a new global order in which the hegemony of a nation would be determined, in no small part, by its access to what had been a coloring dye for plates. As it happened, a Japanese company had been among the outfits searching for ceramic glaze at the Temple Mountain site in the years immediately before Pearl Harbor. They left several of their packing crates abandoned in the Utah desert, sun-weathered kanji characters visible on the wood. Had the government in Tokyo understood what really lay there at Temple Mountain, the war might have ended differently.</p><p>Uranium did not just reshape the political world. Its first detonation at Hiroshima also tapped deep into the religious part of the human consciousness and gave even those who didn&#x2019;t believe in God a scientific reason to believe that civilization would end with a giant apocalyptic burning, much as the ancient texts had predicted. A nonsupernatural method of self-extinction had finally been discovered.</p><p>This unstable element has played many more roles in its brief arc through history, controlling us, to a degree, even as we thought we were in control. It was a searchlight into the inner space of the atom, an inspiration to novelists, a heroic war ender, a prophet of a utopia that never arrived, a polluter, a slow killer, a waster of money, an enabler of failed states, a friend to terrorists, the possible bringer of Armageddon, an excuse for war with Iraq, an incitement for possible war in Iran, and now, too, a possible savior against global warming. Its trajectory has been nothing short of spectacular, luciferous, a Greek drama of the rational age.

Well, it&#x2019;s really a war. Your enemies are your own genes, backed by millions of years of evolution, and the only way to win is to outsmart them.<br><br>Dr. Steven Gundry explains what your body is &#x201c;thinking&#x201d; and tells you why, surprisingly, your genes actually &#x201c;want&#x201d; you to be fat&#x2013;even sick. Eating many so-called healthy foods gives your body the wrong messages and may activate what Dr. Gundry calls &#x201c;killer genes,&#x201d; whose purpose is to get rid of you. Now, with his revolutionary ideas, which enabled him to easily lose 70 pounds, you can reprogram your body for the health, life, looks, and longevity you desire!

GUNDRY, M.D., F.A.C.S., F.A.C.C., is the inventor of some of the most widely used heart-surgery devices and is renowned as an infant heart-transplant surgeon. Now, through his Center for Restorative Medicine, he helps patients avoid cardiac and other surgical procedures by using nutrition to reverse heart disease, diabetes, and arthritis. By bridging the gap between Dr. Atkins and Dr. Ornish and combining the best of the raw-foods and sugar-free plans, Dr. Gundry brings us to the next stage of diet evolution.Chapter 1<br><br>YOUR GENES ARE <br><br>RUNNING THE SHOW<br><br>If you're anything like me, I know you're champing at the bit to get going on Diet Evolution, but hold your horses. I've found that most of us can stick to a program only if we understand how and why we got to our present state of affairs. The next four chapters will do just that.<br><br>You can thank Mom and Dad for your beautiful baby blues, as well as your hair color, height, and build. All these traits were encoded in copies of their genes--half of them her's, the other half his--that now reside in your body. Any children you have will in turn have copies of half of your genes and half of your partner's, and so on through generations to come. Determining our appearance and myriad other characteristics is just one way in which our genes rule our lives. As you'll soon learn, they also play a more clandestine role.<br><br>The answer to why almost all attempts to lose weight fail resides in your genes and the lies they've been feeding you. Once you understand how genes behave, and how their behavior controls your behavior, you'll be rewarded with an understanding of how you can lose those extra pounds, regain your health and vitality, and set the stage for a long, vigorous life. I'm sure you have heard that if you feed your genes right, all your health problems will disappear. But here you are stuck in the same old rut. I'm going to prove to you that you're in poor health and overweight because you're feeding your genes exactly what they want. Let me assure you, your genes are using you for their health and longevity, not yours. In fact, your longevity stands in their way. So sit back, open your mind, and be willing to suspend everything you've ever known about yourself. But first let's get down to basics.<br><br>GENES AS MICROCOMPUTERS<br><br>I've found that it helps to think of genes as tiny computer programs. On your computer, the letter A, for example, is "coded" as 1000001. Whenever I strike A on the keyboard, this code of 0's and 1's tells my computer to make an A appear on the screen. Think of your body as a computer and your genes as its operating system. Genes are pieces of information composed of hundreds or even thousands of sugars and proteins arranged in sequences that "spell out" the process the gene wants a cell to perform. They contain all the information needed to tell each cell what to do, but in this case, the keys that turn genes on or off are circulating hormones, neurotransmitters, and numerous other information carriers, particularly compounds in food. To continue the computer metaphor, these codes work much as typing an Internet address into your Web browser "tells" it what information you want.<br><br>Your genes are totally dependent on your body to protect them and house them until a new computer, in the form of your offspring, can take on these tasks. We need our genes as much as they need us: your body only works when its operating system--your genes--tells it what to do. Over millions of years, the communication between our genes and the human body has undergone continuous improvements and upgrades, all to ensure perpetuation of the genes. Despite myriad improvements--much like Vista replacing Windows, or Panther replacing Tiger--the basic operating system of your genetic program remains the same.<br><br>Okay, you head-shakers, if all this just seems too fantastic to believe, let me ask you why you have no trouble accepting the fact that you can watch Oprah on your cellphone, thanks to invisible electrical impulses from outer space that communicate with cell towers to activate tiny computer programs in your handheld appliance. An invisible but equally powerful, comparable process also happens in our bodies. Why do you think that after two months female dorm mates find their menstrual periods have synchronized? Their hormones sent messages through thin air--rather like text messaging--for them to ovulate at the same time. Hormones or plant chemicals stimulate genes to either switch on or off, determining what's going to happen in each cell, each part of the body, and each person.<br><br>YOUR GENETIC AUTOPILOT<br><br>Indeed, whether you realize it or not, your fate is being controlled by a hidden system that runs most of your cellular, hormonal, nervous system, and aging processes without your conscious input. It does this, so that the "thinking you" doesn't screw up the process of moving genetic material forward in time. If you've seen Stanley Kubrick's classic 2001: A Space Odyssey, in which intergalactic astronauts travel in a spaceship autopiloted by a computer they nickname "Hal," you can envision what's going on in your body. Hal takes care of running all the spacecraft's functions with minimal human input, but when the astronauts try to take over the vehicle, they realize that Hal is in total control and they're just along for the ride. When they attempt to thwart Hal, he tries to destroy them! Your autopilot is usually invisible, but I'm convinced that we constantly receive warning messages from it when processes head in the wrong direction.<br><br>For example, right now you're breathing without thinking about it, but the moment you do, you become conscious of your inhalations and exhalations. Now, let's do a quick test. Stop reading and time yourself as you hold your breath as long as you can. Were you able to go for two minutes? Up to three minutes? Or were you gasping for air at thirty seconds? You mean you were forced to take a breath? How can that be? Aren't you in charge of your body? I ask you to perform a simple task such as holding your breath, and now you're telling me that it was not under your control. Congratulations, you've just met your autopilot, your second self. This mechanism is there for a very important reason: to keep your genetic code from being wasted, in case you get the crazy notion to stop breathing when you're asleep or unconscious, among other things. That's just one of many examples of how Hal's mission is more important than yours!<br><br>We now realize that this operational program is far more than a second nervous system over which we have little or no control. Rather, it's a highly sophisticated system of specialized cells and the genes within them, including those that produce and sense hormones, govern your immune system, line your gut--all in constant communication with each other without your conscious input. If you're still having trouble with this concept, consider the autopilot program on an airplane. Once the human pilot inputs data about the destination into a computer, the autopilot controls direction, speed, thrust, flaps, pitch, and yaw. The autopilot doesn't "see" where the plane is going, doesn't "feel" how fast it is flying, but based on information sent from sensors in the plane or bouncing off satellites, it pretty much "knows" where it is in space and time, allowing it to "fly" the plane and land safely. But input the wrong information and the autopilot will dutifully fly you directly into a mountain, because that's where you told it to go. You'll understand more what I mean by this in the next chapter, when I'll explain how your current way of eating is giving your autopilot the wrong information, programming you for disaster.<br><br>PROGRAMMED FOR SURVIVAL<br><br>At the most basic level, our genes program us to do three things, all with the same purpose: to reproduce. That's right, your genetic code wants nothing more than to keep living. Notice that I didn't say it wants to keep you alive. Your genes are only using you as a host. When they're done with you, they throw the switch, activating the self-destruct "killer genes," and your days are numbered. Bummer! Now let's look at the three directives for which we are genetically hardwired.<br><br>Find and Conserve Energy This one sounds like a no-brainer, but for almost all animals (and plants, too), obtaining adequate nutrition has traditionally been an iffy proposition. Starvation not only kills directly, but also weakens an animal, leaving it more vulnerable to a predator. If you're dead, you can't pass on your genes to the next generation. So obtaining adequate calories with the least expenditure of effort is a primary driving force for all living things. If an animal is consistently in overdrive, burning up mucho calories in pursuit of food, its genes get the message that this combination of genetic material isn't a very good design and therefore should be weeded out. What this means for you is that your genes are programmed to send messages to your body to keep your metabolism low and to eat high-calorie foods.<br><br>Our genes are not only willing participants in this almost irresistible force to eat high-calorie foods, they also drive you to this behavior. Just as you can't suppress the eventual need to take a breath, the drive to conserve energy and obtain the most energy in the form of calories for the least effort is overpowering. Just think about that next time you get in the drive-through line at a fast-food joint. Then consider this: studies of overweight people show that if hunger strikes when there is no food in the house, they often won't make the effort to go out and get it.<br><br>Your computer program also initiates a self-destruct process when it senses that you're overconsuming fuel that will be needed by the next generation to continue the genetic mission. Remember, in any ecosystem, there is only so much food; if you appear to be taking more than your fair share, you're weeded out as a threat!<br><br>Avoid Injury and Pain With the possible exception of teenagers wanting to get their bodies pierced in places you didn't know could be pierced, animals have an innate desire to avoid pain; that's because in most circumstances, pain equates with the potential for injury. If an animal is wounded, it becomes predator bait and its genes die with it. Our hard-wired impulse to avoid pain helps protect us from injury, without the conscious brain having to waste valuable split seconds "thinking" about a response.

When do you hold on? When do you let go? As Kim discovers in this provocative story, we need to be better students of change rather than the instruments of change. Born in Idaho's Bitterroot Mountains and raised in Spokane, Kim moves to Alaska as a young park ranger and discovers a land and sea newly reborn from beneath a retreating glacier. "People are reborn here too," he writes. "This place is that powerful. In Glacier Bay you don't inherit, you create. You practice resurrection because the land and sea show you that anything is possible. Moose swim across fiords. Bears traverse glaciers. Flowers emerge from granite boulders. Inlets fill with glacial silt. Shorelines shift and nautical charts become obsolete as the land - the actual crust of the Earth - rebounds after the immense weight of glacial ice (of just a few hundred years ago) has been lifted."<br>In this tale of friendship, risk, and hope, we find a story of coming home and learning to live gracefully among the deep blue glaciers of Alaska, a place Kim calls "the Africa of America."

Homesick&#x2014;why? She was standing right in her own kitchen. She felt homesick, she realized, with love for home itself. &#x201c;Of all the elements of a happy life,&#x201d; she thought, &#x201c;my home is the most important.&#x201d; In a flash, she decided to undertake a new happiness project, and this time, to focus on home.<br><br>And what did she want from her home?

My self is not confined to my body. It extends into all the things I have made and all the things around me. Without these things, I would not be myself.<br><br>&#x2014;Carl Jung, C. G. Jung Speaking<br><br>Once the season of the harvest, now the season of la rentr�e, September has always been a milestone month for me, and this September had particular significance: After the first week of school, Eliza walked to school alone. Although she has a safe walk of just nine blocks, we both were nervous the first time she left by herself, but after that morning, she was thrilled with her new independence. The change was bittersweet for me, because I would miss our time together.<br><br>Oh well, I comforted myself, Eleanor was just starting kindergarten; I still had many years of morning walks ahead of me. Last May, at the end of nursery school, Eleanor had seemed so big, but in her new school, she was little all over again. As I led her into her classroom on that first morning, I loved seeing the construction-paper decorations, the block area and the dress-up clothes, the rows of carefully labeled cubbies. Already, I felt deeply sentimental.<br><br>When I considered how to be happier at home, I thought first of Eliza, Eleanor, and Jamie. The contents of my home and its architecture mattered much less than its occupants. But while home was the people in it, it was also the physical space and the objects that surrounded me there. I decided to start my happiness project with the theme of &#x201c;Possessions,&#x201d; not because I thought possessions were the most important aspect of my home&#x2014;they weren&#x2019;t&#x2014;but because I knew that in many cases, my possessions blocked my view and weighed me down. Before I wrestled with deeper challenges that struck closer to my heart&#x2014;in the months devoted to &#x201c;Marriage,&#x201d; &#x201c;Parenthood,&#x201d; and &#x201c;Family&#x201d;&#x2014;I wanted to feel more in control of stuff.<br><br>My theme of &#x201c;Possessions,&#x201d; however, wouldn&#x2019;t extend to furniture, wallpaper, bathroom tile, or any permanent aspect of the apartment. Although I knew that many people might be eager to address the home-decor aspect of home, I&#x2019;d never been interested in interior design&#x2014;window treatments, kitchen countertops, or anything else&#x2014;that is, until I read the haunting, evocative book A Pattern Language. In it, visionary architect Christopher Alexander and his team identify 253 &#x201c;patterns&#x201d; that repeat through the architecture that people find most pleasing. As I read about these patterns, I began to fantasize for the first time about living in a dream house, one that incorporated patterns such as &#x201c;Sleeping to the East,&#x201d; &#x201c;Staircase as a Stage,&#x201d; &#x201c;Garden Growing Wild,&#x201d; &#x201c;The Fire,&#x201d; and &#x201c;Private Terrace on the Street.&#x201d; I wanted them all. But although Alexander&#x2019;s grand system of archetypes enthralled me, our current apartment either had elements such as &#x201c;Window Place&#x201d; or &#x201c;Sunny Counter,&#x201d; or, in most cases, it didn&#x2019;t. For this month of Possessions, I would limit myself to the movable objects inside our apartment.<br><br>Within the larger subject of happiness, the proper relationship of possessions to happiness is hotly debated. People often argue that possessions don&#x2019;t&#x2014;or shouldn&#x2019;t&#x2014;matter much to happiness, but I think they do.<br><br>Some research suggests that spending money on an experience brings more happiness than buying a possession, but the line between possessions and experiences isn&#x2019;t always simple to draw. The latest pair of skis is tied to the fun of skiing, and a fashionable dress adds to the fun of meeting friends. A camera is a possession that helps keep happy memories vivid&#x2014;a big happiness booster. A dog is a possession, an experience, a relationship. Also, many wonderful experiences require, or are enhanced by, possessions. Camping is easier with a great tent. Throwing a Halloween party is more fun with wonderful decorations. Choosing postcards enhances the pleasures of traveling. Part of the fun of fly-fishing is picking out the equipment. Also, for many people, shopping itself is an enjoyable experience; acquisition of possessions is part of the fun, but not all of the fun.<br><br>People&#x2019;s desire for possessions can change over time. A friend told me, &#x201c;For years, I loved the feeling that I could pack up my apartment in an afternoon, load it into my car, and drive away.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Like that character in the movie Sex, Lies, and Videotape, who said, &#x2018;I just like having the one key,&#x2019; &#x201d; I said.<br><br>&#x201c;Exactly! I felt so free. I could do anything, go anywhere.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Do you still feel that way?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Over time, I&#x2019;ve started to want to have more things. I&#x2019;m still single, so I can live any way I want, but now I want to be settled someplace, with my things around me.&#x201d;<br><br>We often deny the importance of possessions, or feel embarrassed by our enthusiasm for them, but the desire to possess has roots very deep in human nature. &#x201c;Although there are a few societies in which notions of ownership are absent or downplayed,&#x201d; observe researchers Gail Steketee and Randy Frost in Stuff, &#x201c;in most cultures the interaction between people and their things is a central aspect of life.&#x201d;<br><br>Of course, the practice of denying the importance of possessions is also ancient, and many cultures extol the principle of nonattachment and the relinquishment of worldly goods. It&#x2019;s certainly true that possessions, or the desire for possessions, can undermine happiness, and that some people are happier when they own very little. I once had a long conversation with a twenty-three-year-old guy who tried to convince me how happy I&#x2019;d be if only I would downsize to one backpack of stuff. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t tell you how much more serene I feel, now that I&#x2019;ve gotten rid of practically everything,&#x201d; he said earnestly. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s the answer.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;For you,&#x201d; I said, with a laugh. &#x201c;But it&#x2019;s not the answer for everyone.&#x201d;<br><br>For me, I knew, possessions had a role to play. In fact, one of my goals for the month was to glean more happiness from my possessions.<br><br>The fact is, attachment brings happiness, and attachment brings unhappiness. Love&#x2014;for people, for possessions, for a place, for an animal, for a house, for anything&#x2014;exposes us to the pain of loss. It&#x2019;s inescapable. We can mitigate that pain by moderating or even eliminating attachment, but while something is gained, something is also relinquished. I wanted to love my possessions, and yet not be mastered by them.<br><br>In the persistent debate over the proper role of possessions and spending, I often heard the argument &#x201c;It&#x2019;s awful; people are so materialistic. They think that money and buying things can make them happy, but they can&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br><br>This statement contains more than one idea. The first idea is that &#x201c;Money can&#x2019;t buy happiness.&#x201d; True, money can&#x2019;t buy happiness, but spent wisely, it can buy things that contribute mightily to a happy life. People&#x2019;s most pressing worries include financial anxiety, health concerns, job insecurity, and having to do tiring and boring chores, and money can help to relieve these problems. Money can help us stay close to other people, which is perhaps the key to happiness. It can help us support causes we believe in. It can help us pursue activities that bring us happiness, whether raising children, planting a flower garden, or planning a vacation.<br><br>The second idea is that people (not us or our friends, of course, but other people) are too &#x201c;materialistic,&#x201d; that is, they place too much importance on owning things and showing them off. True, people who are materialistic tend to have unrealistically high expectations of the power of material things, and they seek to define themselves, or raise their status, or make themselves happier through possessions. Studies show that highly materialistic people are less happy, though which is the cause and which is the consequence isn&#x2019;t clear.<br><br>However, in some situations, behavior that might outwardly seem &#x201c;materialistic&#x201d; has a nonmaterialistic cause. Conspicuous consumption doesn&#x2019;t explain every flashy purchase. For instance, I have a friend who&#x2019;s always the first to buy the latest gizmo&#x2014;not to show that he can afford it, but to feed his fascination with technology. Clothes are a puzzle. Some people appreciate beautiful clothes for their own sake; it&#x2019;s not all about making a display for other people, though that&#x2019;s part of it, too. Virginia Woolf noted in her diary: &#x201c;But I must remember to write about my clothes next time I have an impulse to write. My love of clothes interests me profoundly; only it is not love; and what it is I must discover.&#x201d; Is this love purely &#x201c;materialistic&#x201d;?<br><br>For better or worse, buying things (or photographing them, cataloging them, or writing reviews about them) is a way to engage with the world. When we&#x2019;re interested in something, we often express that interest by researching, shopping, buying, and collecting. People who love art go to museums, but when they can afford it, they usually want to buy art, too. People who love to cook enjoy buying kitchen tools and exotic ingredients. The latest sports equipment probably isn&#x2019;t much different from what&#x2019;s already in the closet. We crave to buy and possess the things we love, even when it&#x2019;s not necessary. I&#x2019;m interested in reading The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin only every so often, and my neighborhood library has two copies, yet I want my own copy. When we possess things, we often want to show and share them with other people. Is that necessarily &#x201c;materialistic&#x201d; behavior?<br><br>Many of the most precious possessions are valuable not because of their cost or prestige, but because of the meanings they contain; modest trinkets, homemade objects, worn books, old photographs, whimsical collections. (After someone&#x2019;s death, how strange to see the value drain away from his or her possessions; useful household objects such as clothes, or dish towels, or personal papers become little more than trash.)<br><br>Because we often want to deny the importance of possessions, and because we don&#x2019;t want to seem materialistic, we often don&#x2019;t spend enough time and attention thinking about how possessions could boost happiness&#x2014;or at least I didn&#x2019;t. My possessions had a powerful influence over the atmosphere of my home, and they contributed to, and reflected, my sense of identity.<br><br>Was it possible to be happy with very few possessions? Yes. Were some people happier when they owned almost nothing? Yes. But for most people, including me, possessions, wisely chosen, could be a boon to happiness.<br><br>Possessions have a role to play in happiness, yet it seemed as though every time I visited a bookstore, turned on the TV, or picked up a newspaper or magazine, I heard the message &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll be happier with less!&#x201d; Whenever I fell into conversation with people about the subject of happiness at home, I often heard the response, &#x201c;Oh, I need to simplify.&#x201d;<br><br>Some of the great minds in history urge us toward simplicity. Thoreau admonished, &#x201c;Our life is frittered away by detail. . . . Simplicity, simplicity, simplicity!&#x201d; This longing for simplicity is so powerful and complex that it needs its own term, much like nostalgie de la boue (yearning for the mud) or wabi sabi (the beauty of the imperfect and impermanent). When I asked on my blog if anyone knew a term to capture this idea, one reader coined the wonderful word &#x201c;Waldenlust.&#x201d; This longing takes several forms: fantasies of the freedom that dispossession would bring; nostalgia for earlier, supposedly simpler times; and reverence for the primitive, which is assumed to be more authentic and closer to nature.<br><br>I&#x2019;ve often felt a yearning to escape from the ties of ownership. I&#x2019;ve wanted to dump the entire contents of a chest of drawers into the trash rather than endure the headache of sorting the good from the bad. I often choose not to buy something useful or beautiful, because I don&#x2019;t want the responsibility of another possession. Years ago, walking through a convenience store parking lot in some small, nameless California town, I had a sudden vision of abandoning everything, my possessions, relationships, ambition, to disappear, unencumbered. What care I for my goose-feather bed?&#x2014;I&#x2019;m away with the raggle-taggle gypsies-o. Sometimes, too, in an eerie, dark reversal, I love something so much that I feel the urge to destroy it, to be free from that attachment and the fear of loss. (I was so puzzled by this impulse that I wrote a book about it, Profane Waste.)<br><br>One friend had a particularly acute case of Waldenlust. He was headed to his parents&#x2019; house to go through the twenty boxes he&#x2019;d stored there. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s terrible to say, but I really wish there&#x2019;d be a fire or a flood,&#x201d; he said ruefully. &#x201c;Then I&#x2019;d be done. I hate the thought of dealing with all that stuff.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why are you doing it?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;My parents are really annoyed. I promised I&#x2019;d leave the boxes there just temporarily, but they&#x2019;ve been there a year now.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;If you haven&#x2019;t needed anything for a year, maybe nothing&#x2019;s important,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;If you wish everything would get destroyed in a fire, maybe you could throw the boxes away, without going through them.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, I couldn&#x2019;t do that,&#x201d; he shook his head. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t just throw it all away, even if I don&#x2019;t want it.&#x201d;<br><br>I nodded. I understood the demands of those dusty cardboard boxes. Even though they sat neglected and unwanted, somehow they held pieces of&#x2014;himself? the past?&#x2014;that couldn&#x2019;t be discarded recklessly.<br><br>In the past few years, I&#x2019;d made great headway in conquering my own clutter, but I still wasn&#x2019;t free from it. The press of superfluous possessions made me feel unsettled and harried, and the demands required by acquisition, use, maintenance, storage, and even relinquishment ate up my energy and time.<br><br>However, although I wanted to simplify, I also feared that I was too inclined to simplify. Of course, the virtues of simplicity lay far deeper than mere elimination, yet I saw a danger in my craving; I didn&#x2019;t want to be tempted to cut away too much.<br><br>The first principle of my happiness project was to &#x201c;Be Gretchen.&#x201d; One important way to &#x201c;Be Gretchen&#x201d; was not to assume that virtues that others strive to cultivate are the ones that I should strive for. Others strive to save; I push myself to spend out. Others try to work more; I try to play more. Others strive for simplicity; I fight the simplifying impulse, because if anything, I cultivate too much simplicity&#x2014;not a disciplined, thoughtful simplicity, but one created by indifference and neglect.<br><br>There&#x2019;s a lassitude deep in my soul; I always have to fight my urge to do nothing. If I didn&#x2019;t have to consider Jamie and my daughters, if I didn&#x2019;t have my mother to coach me along, I&#x2019;d be living in a studio with bare walls, crooked blinds, and a futon on the floor, forever. For some, that simplicity would seem attractive and perhaps even admirable, but not to me. In my case, it would be the simplicity of evasion and apathy, not the simplicity of beautiful emptiness or voluntary poverty.<br><br>I&#x2019;ve always been this way. After I graduated from college, I lived in a house in Washington, D.C., with three friends. After the first year, one of my housemates said kindly, &#x201c;The thing about living with you, Gretchen, is that you don&#x2019;t subtract, and you don&#x2019;t add. You never leave a mess, and you never bring home a dessert or call the cable guy.&#x201d; Which was so obviously true that it didn&#x2019;t even hurt my feelings.</p><h2>Make It So: Leadership Lessons from Star Trek the Next Generation</h2><p>A management guide bases its principles on the practices of the Star Trek: The Next Generation crew and the leadership of Captain Picard, which focus on shared goals, effective communication, teamwork, and honor.</p><p>T he fast-changing business world of today is far different from just a few years ago.

So he sent a special thank-you--a tiny image of a single pale spear of the prized vegetable. These and other lushly painted still lifes of flowers, fruits, and other foodstuffs, isolated or in groups, form one of the most beguiling aspects of Manet's output from the 1860s through the early '80s. <i>Manet: The Still-Life Paintings</i>, the catalog for the exhibition at the Walters Art Gallery in Baltimore, Maryland, through April 22, 2001, serves as a pleasant introduction to the intimate late work of the great 19th-century realist. With 106 color reproductions, including close-up details of brushwork, the modestly scaled volume makes for a satisfying browse. The most deliciously unexpected treats are the luminous watercolors of fruit, nuts, or flowers that Manet interwove with his personal correspondence.<p> Earlier in Manet's career, still-life images played a supporting role in figure paintings. Author George Mauner, professor emeritus of art history at Pennsylvania State University, guides the reader to observe such details as the cherry falling in midair in <i>Young Man w ith Cherries</i>. This fascination with instantaneous effects would culminate 11 years later in the smoking rifles of the Mexican troops in <i>The Execution of Emperor Maximilian</i>. Manet, of course, was well aware of the tradition of still life as an invocation of the senses and as a reminder of the fleeting nature of sensual pleasure (and life itself). Mauner explains how this art-historical knowledge offers clues to some of the artist's more enigmatic paintings. The quote-heavy, name-dropping style of fellow essayist Henri Loyrette seems less attuned to a general reader's interests. But the book's most grievous sin is one of omission: the failure to include even the briefest biographical outline of Manet's life and work. <i>--Cathy Curtis</i></p>GEORGE MAUNER is Distinguished Professor Emeritus of Art History at Pennsylvania State University and is an authority on 19th-century art.

Each of his books is vastly different in its content, design, and illustrations but one aspect remains constant throughout his work: his passion about his subjects. Rumford, a resident of Hawaii, has studied more than a dozen languages and worked in the Peace Corps, where he traveled to Africa, Asia, and Afghanistan. He draws from these experiences and the history of his subject when he is working on a book. His book Sequoyah: The Cherokee Man Who Gave His People Writing was a 2005 Sibert Honor winner.Grade 2-5-This picture-book biography tells the intriguing story of the man who deciphered Egyptian hieroglyphs. As a child, Jean-Fran?ois Champollion learned that no one could read Egyptian writing and determined that he would be the one to do so. By age 16, he had learned all the known ancient languages and was eager to work with scholars who were attempting to translate the hieroglyphs with the help of the Rosetta Stone. Though they turned him down, he doggedly pursued his passion on his own and at age 30, had a sudden breakthrough. While studying the name of a Pharaoh copied from a temple wall, he discovered that the characters were not just related to meaning, but also to sounds. Though the key to unlocking the secret may not be completely clear to children, Champollion's fascination with hieroglyphs and the realization of his dream will capture their interest and perhaps whet their curiosity for further study. Framed watercolor paintings done in soft blues, purples, and sunlit pinks evoke a sense of mystery compatible with the suspense of the scholar's discovery process. Small hieroglyphs are embedded in the text. Those with less-obvious meanings seem distracting at first reading. More effective are the larger, captioned ones in the margins that make the picture-meaning connection clear ("There is a long-necked, far-seeing giraffe in 'predict'"). Overall, an engaging introduction to a timeless topic.<br><i>Adele Greenlee, Bethel College, St. Paul, MN </i><br>Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Fabric of America: How Our Borders and Boundaries Shaped the Country and Forged Our National Identity</h2><p><p>With the same mix of compelling narrative history and captivating historical argument that made his previous book, <i>Measuring America</i>, such a success, Andro Linklater relates in fascinating detail how, the borders and boundaries that formed states and a nation inspired the sense of identity that has have ever since been central to the American experiment.</p><p>Linklater opens with America's greatest surveyor, Andrew Ellicott, measuring the contentious boundary between Pennsylvania and Virginia in the summer of 1784; and he ends standing at the yellow line dividing the United States and Mexico at Tijuana. In between, he chronicles the evolving shape of the nation, physically and psychologically. As Americans pushed westward in the course of the nineteenth century, the borders and boundaries established by surveyors like Ellicott created property, uniting people in a desire for the government and laws that would protect it. Challenging Frederick Jackson Turner's famed frontier thesis, Linklater argues that we are , thus, defined not by open spaces but by boundaries. "What Americanized the immigrants was not the frontier experience" Linklater writes, "but the fact that it took place inside the United States frontier." Those same borders had the ability to divide as well as unite, as the great battle over internal boundaries during the Civil War would show. By century's end, however, we were spreading U.S. power beyond our borders, an act that, seen through Linklater's eyes, offers an intriguing perspective on our role in the world today.</p><p>Linklater's great achievement is to weave these provocative arguments into a dramatic storyline, wherein the actions of Ellicott, Thomas Jefferson, the treasonous general James Wilkinson, Abraham Lincoln and Stephen Douglas, and numerous hitherto invisible settlers, all illuminate the shaping of the nation. This brilliant book will alter forever readers' perception of America and what it means to be an American.</p></p><p><p><b>Andro Linklater</b> is the author of <i>Measuring America: How an Untamed Wilderness Shaped the United States and Fulfilled the Promise of Democracy</i> as well as <i>The Code of Love</i> and several other books. He lives in England.</p><p>&#x201c;A history of America that looks at land from a slightly different angle - that of real estate...Mr. Linklater's history is one of increasing federal power. A territory had to meet federal standards before it could be admitted as a state, and so the interior became more loyal to federal power than the original 13 colonies. The most exciting episode in this book concerns a plot to break Kentucky and Tennessee off from the union, in collusion with the Spanish government at Natchez. Only the good offices of Andrew Ellicott, Mr. Linklater's favorite surveyor and perennial hero, prevented the conspiracy, by proving in 1797 that Natchez actually lay within American territory, in modern day Mississippi - as opposed to Spanish Florida. After Ellicott promised the local white landowners that their property - including slaves - would be preserved, the assumption of American jurisdiction was assured.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Benjamin Lytal, New York Sun</i></p><p>&#x201c;Linklater gives us a different perspective than we usually get when reading about how the U.S. developed. The frontier experience took place not only in wide open spaces, but within the borders of the United States. How that happened is an important story and Linklater tells it splendidly.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Roger Bishop, BOOKPAGE</i></p><p>&#x201c;Scottish-born Linklater (<i>Measuring America</i>) delivers a readable story of how borders helped shape America. He refutes Frederick Jackson Turner's famous thesis that the frontier gave us a dislike for direct control and government dependence. Instead, he effectively argues that without literal boundaries, our history would be much more treacherous....This book, addressing little-known history, will appeal to general readers, while students can use it to research the other side of Turner's thesis. Highly recommended for both public and college libraries.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Library Journal (starred review)</i></p><p>&#x201c;Contradicting historian Frederick Jackson Turner's famous "frontier thesis," Linklater (<i>Measuring America</i>, 2002, etc.) claims it was America's borders that shaped our national character...An ingenious premise delivered in lively, accessible prose backed by impressive research.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i></p></p><h2>Looking for Jake and Other Stories</h2><p>Step into a London ravaged by unearthly creatures at once utterly alien and chillingly familiar. In China Mieville&#39;s award-winning novella &#39;The Tain&#39;, we learn the reason for the invaders&#39; terrible revenge. One survivor must trek through the ruins of the city with a desperate plan to stand against their assault. In addition to &#39;The Tain&#39;, this superb collection contains thirteen short stories, of visionary cityscapes and urban paranoia, ghosts, monsters and impossible diseases. Several of the stories are published here for the first time: these include one set in New Crobuzon, the location of the award-winning series of novels that began with Perdido Street Station; and one in comic-strip form, illustrated by top graphic artist Liam Sharp. This collection displays the sheer imaginative scope of China Mieville&#39;s work.</p><p>China Mieville lives and works in London. He is three-time winner of the prestigious Arthur C. Clarke Award (Perdido Street Station, Iron Council and The City &amp; The City) and has also won the British Fantasy Award twice (Perdido Street Station and The Scar).

His most recent novel, Kraken, was published in 2010.I don&#x2019;t know how I lost you. I remember there was that long time of searching for you, frantic and sick-making . . . I was almost ecstatic with anxiety. And then I found you, so that was alright. Only I lost you again. And I can&#x2019;t make out how it happened.<br><br> I&#x2019;m sitting out here on the flat roof you must remember, looking out over this dangerous city. There is, you remember, a dull view from my roof. There are no parks to break up the urban monotony, no towers worth a damn. Just an endless, featureless cross-hatching of brick and concrete, a drab chaos of interlacing backstreets stretching out interminably behind my house. I was disappointed when I first moved here; I didn&#x2019;t see what I had in that view. Not until Bonfire Night.<br><br> I just caught a buffet of cold air and the sound of wet cloth in the wind. I saw nothing, of course, but I know that an early riser flew right past me. I can see dusk welling up behind the gas towers.<br><br> That night, November the fifth, I climbed up and watched the cheap fireworks roar up all around me. They burst at the level of my eyes, and I traced their routes in reverse to mark all the tiny gardens and balconies from which they flew. There was no way I could keep track; there were just too many. So I sat up there in the midst of all that red and gold and gawped in awe. That washed-out grey city I had ignored for days spewed out all that power, that sheer beautiful energy.<br><br> I was seduced then. I never forgot that display, I was never again fooled by the quiescence of the backstreets I saw from my bedroom window. They were dangerous. They remain dangerous.<br><br> But of course it&#x2019;s a different kind of dangerous now. Everything&#x2019;s changed. I floundered, I found you, I lost you again, and I&#x2019;m stuck above these pavements with no one to help me.<br><br> I can hear hissing and gentle gibbering on the wind. They&#x2019;re roosting close by, and with the creeping dark they&#x2019;re stirring, and waking.<br><br> You never came round enough. There was I with my new flat above the betting shops and cheap hardware stores and grocers of Kilburn High Road. It was cheap and lively. I was a pig in shit. I was happy as Larry. I ate at the local Indian and went to work and self-consciously patronised the poky little independent bookshop, despite its pathetic stock. And we spoke on the phone and you even came by, a few times. Which was always excellent.<br><br> I know I never came to you. You lived in fucking Barnet. I&#x2019;m only human.<br><br> What were you up to, anyway? How could I be so close to someone, love someone so much, and know so little about their life? You wafted into northwest London with your plastic bags, vague about where you&#x2019;d been, vague about where you were going, who you were seeing, what you were up to. I still don&#x2019;t know how you had the money to indulge your tastes for books and music. I still don&#x2019;t understand what happened with you and that woman you had that fucked-up affair with.<br><br> I always liked how little our love-lives impacted on our relationship. We would spend the day playing arcade games and shooting the shit about x or y film, or comic, or album, or book, and only as an afterthought as you gathered yourself to go, we&#x2019;d mention the heartache we were suffering, or the blissed-out perfection of our new lovers.<br><br> But I had you on tap. We might not speak for weeks, but one phone call was all it would ever need.<br><br> That won&#x2019;t work now. I don&#x2019;t dare touch my phone anymore. For a long time there was no dialling tone, only irregular bursts of static, as if my phone were scanning for signals. Or as if it were jamming them.<br><br> The last time I picked up the receiver something whispered to me down the wires, asked me a question in a reverential tone, in a language I did not understand, all sibilants and dentals. I put the phone down carefully and have not lifted it since.<br><br> So I learnt to see the view from my roof in the garish glow of fireworks, to hold it in the awe it deserved. That view is gone now. It&#x2019;s changed. It has the same topography, it&#x2019;s point for point the same as it ever was, but it&#x2019;s been hollowed out and filled with something new. Those dark thoroughfares are no less beautiful, but everything has changed.<br><br> The angle of my window, the height of my roof, hid the tarmac and paving stones from me: I saw the tops of houses and walls and rubble and skips, but I couldn&#x2019;t see ground level, I never saw a single human being walk those streets. And that lifeless panorama I saw brimmed with potential energy. The roads might be thronging, there might be a street party or a traffic accident or a riot just out of my sight. It was a very full emptiness I learnt to see, on Bonfire Night, a very charged desolation.<br><br> That charge has changed polarity. The desolation remains. Now I can see no one because no one is there. The roads are not thronging, and there are no street parties out there at all, nor could there ever be again.<br><br> Sometimes, of course, those streets must snap into sharp focus as a figure strides down them, determined and nervous, as I myself stride down Kilburn High Road when I leave the house. And usually the figure will be lucky, and reach the deserted supermarket without incident, and find food and leave and get home again, as I have been lucky.<br><br> Sometimes, though, they will fall through a faultline in the pavement and disappear with a despairing wail, and the street will be empty. Sometimes they will smell something enticing from a cosy-looking house, trip eager into the open front door, and be gone. Sometimes they will pass through glimmering filaments that dangle from the dirty trees, and they will be reeled in.<br><br> I imagine some of these things. I don&#x2019;t know how people are disappeared, in these strange days, but hundreds of thousands, millions of souls have gone. London&#x2019;s main streets, like the high road I can see from the front of my house, contain only a few anxious figures&#x2014;a drunk, maybe, a lost-looking policeman listening to the gibberish from his radio, someone sitting nude in a doorway&#x2014;everyone avoiding everyone else&#x2019;s eyes.<br><br> The backstreets are almost deserted.<br><br> What&#x2019;s it like where you are, Jake? Are you still out there in Barnet? Is it full? Has there been a rush to the suburbs?<br><br> I doubt it&#x2019;s as dangerous as Kilburn.<br><br> Nowhere&#x2019;s as dangerous as Kilburn.<br><br> I&#x2019;ve found myself living in the Badlands.<br><br> This is where it&#x2019;s all at, this is the centre. Only a few stupid shits like me live here now, and we are disappearing one by one. I have not seen the corduroy man for days, and the glowering youth who camped down in the bakery is no longer there.<br><br> We shouldn&#x2019;t stay here. We have, after all, been warned.<br><br> Kill. Burn.<br><br> Why do I stay? I could make my way in reasonable safety southwards, towards the centre. I&#x2019;ve done it before; I know what to do. Travel at midday, clutch my A&#x2013;Z like a talisman. I swear it protects me. It&#x2019;s become my grimoire. It would take an hour or so to walk to Marble Arch, and it&#x2019;s a main road all the way. Those are reasonable odds.<br><br> I&#x2019;ve done it before, walked down Maida Vale, over the canal, full these days of obscure detritus. Past the tower on the Edgware Road with the exoskeleton of red girders that jut into the sky twenty feet above the flat roof. I have heard something padding and snorting in the confines of that high prison, caught a glimpse of glistening muscle and slick fur shaking the metal in agitation.<br><br> I think the things that flap drop food into the cage from above.<br><br> But get past that and I&#x2019;m home free, onto Oxford Street, where most of London now lives. I was last there a month ago, and they&#x2019;d done a decent job of it. Several shops are operating, accepting the absurd hand-scrawled notes that pass for currency, selling what items they can salvage, or make, or find delivered to them inexplicably in the morning.<br><br> They can&#x2019;t escape it, of course, what&#x2019;s happening to the city. Signs of it abound.<br><br> With so many people gone the city is generating its own rubbish. In the cracks of buildings and the dark spaces under abandoned cars little knots of matter are self-organising into grease-<br><br> stained chip wrappers, broken toys, cigarette packets, before snapping the tiny umbilicus that anchors them to the ground and drifting out across the streets. Even on Oxford Street every morning sees a fresh crop of litter, each filthy newborn piece marked with a minuscule puckered navel.<br><br> Even on Oxford Street, every day without fail in front of the newsagents, the bundles appear: the Telegraph and Lambeth News. The only papers to survive the quiet cataclysm. They are generated daily, written, published, and delivered by person or persons or forces unseen.<br><br> I already crept downstairs today, Jake, to pick up my copy of the Telegraph from across the road. The headline is &#x201c;Autochthonic Masses Howling and Wet-Mouthed.&#x201d; The subhead: &#x201c;Pearl, Faeces, Broken Machines.&#x201d;<br><br> But even with these reminders, Oxford Street is a reassuring place. Here, people get up and go to work, dress in clothes we would recognise from nine months ago, have coffee in the morning, and resolutely ignore the impossibility of what they are doing. So why don&#x2019;t I stay there?<br><br> I think it&#x2019;s the invitation from the Gaumont State that keeps me here, Jake.<br><br> I can&#x2019;t leave Kilburn behind. There are secrets here I haven&#x2019;t found. Kilburn is the centre of the new city, and the Gaumont State is the centre of Kilburn.<br><br> The Gaumont was inspired, preposterously, by New York&#x2019;s Empire State Building. On a miniature scale, perhaps, but its lines and curves are dignified and impassive and easily ignore the low brick-and-dirt camouflage of their surroundings. It was still a cinema when I was a child, and I remember the symmetrical sweep of the twin staircases within, the opulence of chandelier and carpet and marble tracings.<br><br> Multiplexes, with their glorified video screens and tatty decor, are unimpressed by cinema. The Gaumont is of an age when film was still a miracle. It was a cathedral.<br><br> It closed and grew shabby. And then it opened again, to the electronic chords of slot machines in the vestibule. Outside, two huge neon standards explained the Gaumont&#x2019;s new purpose in vertical script, reading downwards: Bingo.<br><br> You were my first thought, as soon as I knew something had happened. I don&#x2019;t remember waking when the train pulled into London. My first memory is stepping off the carriage into the evening cool and feeling afraid.<br><br> It was no ESP, no sixth sense that told me something was wrong. It was my eyes.<br><br> The platform was full, as you would expect, but the crowd moved like none I had ever seen. There were no tides, no currents moving to and from the indicator board, the ticket counter, the shops. No fractal patterns emerged from this mass. The flap of a butterfly&#x2019;s wing in one corner of the station would create no typhoons, no storms, not a sough of wind anywhere else. The deep order of chaos had broken down.<br><br> It looked as I imagine purgatory must. A huge room full of vacant souls milling atomised and pointless, each in personal despair.<br><br> I saw a guard, as alone as all the others.<br><br> What&#x2019;s happened? I asked him. He was confused, shaking his head. He would not look at me. Something&#x2019;s happened, he said. Something . . . there was a collapse . . . nothing works properly . . .<br><br> there&#x2019;s been a . . . a breakdown . . .<br><br> He was being very inexact. That wasn&#x2019;t his fault. It was a very inexact apocalypse.<br><br> Between the time I had closed my eyes on the train and the time I had opened them again, some organising principle had failed.<br><br> I&#x2019;ve always imagined the occurrence in very literal terms. I have always envisaged a vast impossible building, a spiritual power station with an unstable core shitting out the world&#x2019;s energy and connectivity. I&#x2019;ve always envisaged the cogs and wheels of that unthinkable machinery overheating, some critical mass being reached . . . the mechanisms faltering and seizing up as the core explodes soundlessly and spews its poisonous fuel across the city and beyond.<br><br> In Bhopal, Union Carbide vomited up a torturing, killing bile. In Chernobyl the fallout was a more insidious cellular terrorism.<br><br> And now Kilburn erupts with vague entropy.<br><br> I know, Jake, I know, you can&#x2019;t help smiling, can you? From the awesome and terrible to the ridiculous. The walls here are not stacked high with corpses. There is rarely any blood when the inhabitants of London disappear. But the city&#x2019;s winding down, Jake, and Kilburn is the epicentre of the burnout.<br><br> I left the guard alone in his confusion.<br><br> Got to find Jake, I thought.<br><br> You&#x2019;re probably smiling self-deprecatingly when you read that, but I swear to you it&#x2019;s true. You&#x2019;d been in the city when it happened, you had seen it. Think of it, Jake. I was asleep, in transit, neither here nor there. I didn&#x2019;t know this city, I&#x2019;d never been here before. But you&#x2019;d watched it being born.<br><br> There was no one else in the city for me. You could be my guide, or we could at least be lost together.<br><br> The sky was utterly dead. It looked cut out of matte black paper and pasted above the silhouettes of the towers. All the pigeons were gone. We didn&#x2019;t know it then, but the unseen flapping things had burst into existence full-grown and ravenous. In the first few hours they swept the skies quite clean of prey.<br><br> The streetlamps were still working, as they are now, but in any case there was nothing profound about the darkness. I wandered nervously, found a telephone box. It didn&#x2019;t seem to want my money but it let me make the call anyway.<br><br> Your mother answered.<br><br> Hello, she said. She sounded listless and nonplussed.<br><br> I paused for far too long. I was groping for new etiquette in this new time. I had no sense of social rules, and I stammered as I wondered whether to say something about the change.<br><br> Is Jake there please? I finally said, banal and absurd.<br><br> He&#x2019;s gone, she said. He&#x2019;s not here. He went out this morning to shop, and he hasn&#x2019;t come back.<br><br> Your brother came on the line then and spoke brusquely. He went to some bookshop, he said, and I knew where you were then.<br><br> It was the bookshop we found on the right as you leave Willesden Green station, where the slope of the high road begins to steepen. It is cheap and capricious. We were seduced by the immaculate edition of Voyage to Arcturus in the window, and entertained by the juxtaposition of Kierkegaard and Paul Daniels.<br><br> If I could have chosen where to be when London wound down, it would be in that zone, where the city first notices the sky, at the summit of a hill, surrounded by low streets that let sound escape into the clouds. Kilburn, ground zero, just over the thin bulwark of backstreets. Perhaps you had a presentiment that morning, Jake, and when the breakdown came you were ready, waiting in that perfect vantage point.</p><h2>The Essays of Virginia Woolf, Vol. 1: 1904-1912</h2><p>Nonfiction pieces dating from 1904, when she was twenty-three, to 1912, the year of her marriage to Leonard Woolf. "These are polished works of literary journalism-shrewd, deft, inquisitive, graceful, and often sparkling" (Library Journal). Edited and with an Introduction by Andrew McNeillie; Index.<br></p><p>VIRGINIA WOOLF (1882&#x2013;1941) was&nbsp;one of the major literary figures of the twentieth century. An admired literary critic, she authored many essays, letters, journals, and short stories in addition to her groundbreaking novels.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Spanish</p><h2>Shades of Noir: A Reader</h2><p>For this was the summer when, after the hiatus of the Second World War, French critics were again given the opportunity to view films from Hollywood. The films they saw, including <i>The Maltese Falcon, Double Indemnity. Laura, Murder, My Sweet</i>, and <i>The Woman in the Window</i>, prompted the naming and theorization of a new phenomenon: <i>film noir</i>.<br><br>Much of what has been written about the genre since has remained within the orbit of this preliminary assessment. While sympathetic towards the early French critics, this collection of original essays attempts to move beyond their first fascinated look. Beginning with an autonomy of that look&#x2014;of the &#x2018;<i>poujadist</i>&#x2018; climate that nourished it and the imminent collapse of the Hollywood studio system that gave it its mournful inflection&#x2014;<i>Shades of Noir</i> re-explores and calls into question the object first constructed by it. The impetus for this shift in perspective comes from the films themselves, viewed in the light of contemporary social and political concerns, and from new theoretical insights.<br><br>Several contributions analyze the re-emergence of noir in recent years, most notably in the hybrid forms produced in the 1980s by the merging of noir with science fiction and horror, for example <i>Blade Runner</i> and <i>Angel Heart</i>, and in films by black directors such as <i>Deep Cover, Straight out of Brooklyn, A Rage in Harlem</i> and <i>One False Move</i>. Other essays focus on the open urban territory in which the noir hero hides out; the office spaces in <i>Chandler</i>, and the palpable sense of waiting that fills empty warehouses, corridors and hotel rooms. <br><br>Finally, <i>Shades of Noir</i> pays renewed attention to the lethal relation between the sexes; to the femme fatale and the other women in noir. As the role of women expands, the femme fatale remains deadly, but her deadliness takes on new meanings. <br><br>Contributors: Janet Bergstrom, Joan Copjec, Elizabeth Cowie, Manthia Diawara, Frederic Jameson, Dean MacCannel, Fred Pfeil, David Reid and Jayne L. Walker, Marc Vernet, Slavoj i ek.</p><p><b>Joan Copjec</b> is Professor of English and Comparative Literature and Director of the Center for the Study of Psychoanalysis and Culture at the State University of New York, Buffalo.The essays in this volume examine the widely studied and discussed genre from a variety of perspectives, not always agreeing on exactly what constitutes film noir or which movies exemplify its elements. Beyond such acknowledged classics as Double Indemnity (1944), one contributor sees noir elements in recent black-oriented films such as A Rage in Harlem (1991), while another attempts to explain the noir significance of Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991). The more interesting selections here include an essay on female characters and one on the making of Fritz Lang's The Blue Gardenia (1953). Other pieces, notably the introduction and essay by Copjec, become bogged down in virtually impenetrable academese and are too nitpicky to interest most readers. Not really suitable as an introduction to the genre, this is worth considering as a secondary source for larger collections.<br><i>- David C. Tucker, DeKalb Cty.

Forthwith he takes a new approach. Billed as a celebration of "a cuisine that is rewarding without being demanding," this book may shock his fans. Staples here come from cans, bottles, freezer cases and packages; some recipes are eerily reminiscent of back-of-the-box concoctions--borscht made with canned beets; a split pita bread butttered and sprinkled with Parmesan before a run into the toaster oven. Regardless, Pepin achieves his aim: to cook with minimal effort while providing zesty meals. Some recipes call for costly fresh ingredients (lobster, veal chops). More affordable yet still adventurous are black bean hummus with smoked oysters and sour cream, a salad of sardines augmented with ripe tomatoes, and Bartlett pears baked in puff pastry shells. "If something tastes good, it doesn't matter whether it is 'authentic' or prepared 'correctly'--what works, works," Pepin declares. All the same, the audience of working parents who most need fast meals may balk at paying $20 for a cookbook when equally simple-to-fix recipes can indeed be found on the backs of bottles, cans and jars for a song.

His pursuit of a more artistic way of life shocks and irritates his parents and in-laws. Why has he swapped roles with Tonie Swann, his intense, intellectual wife, who has accepted a demanding full-time job? How can this be good for Alexa?<br><br>Tonie is increasingly seduced away from domestic life by the harder, headier world of work, where long-forgotten memories of ambition are awakened. She soon finds herself outside their tight family circle, alive to previously unimaginable possibilities. Over the course of a year full of crisis and revelation, we follow the fortunes of Tonie, Thomas, and his brothers and their families: Howard, the successful, indulgent brother, and his gregarious wife, Claudia; and Leo, lacking in confidence and propped up by Susie, his sharp-tongued, heavy-drinking wife. At the head of the family, the aging Bradshaw parents descend on their children to question and undermine them.<br><br><i>The Bradshaw Variations </i>reveals how our choices, our loves, and the family life we build will always be an echo&#x2014;a variation&#x2014;of a theme played out in our own childhood.

Thomas Bradshaw asks himself this question frequently. He does not yet know the answer. He used to believe art was a kind of pretending, but he doesn�&#x20ac;&#x2122;t think that any more. He uses the word authenticity to describe what he thinks now. Some things are artificial and some are authentic. It is easy to tell when something is artificial. The other is harder.</p><p>In the mornings he listens to music, to Bach or Schubert. He stands in the kitchen in his dressing gown. He waits for his wife and daughter to come downstairs. He is forty-one, the age when a life comes out of its own past like something out of a mould; and either it is solid, all of a piece, or it fails to hold its shape and disintegrates. The disintegration is not difficult to imagine. It is the solidity, the concrete form, that is mystifying. Disintegration does not involve questions of authenticity, but of a solid form the questions must be asked.</p><p>Mostly, in fact, it is the lodger Olga who comes down first. He hears her tread on the stairs and doesn�&#x20ac;&#x2122;t recognise it: that is how, every day, he identifies her, by hearing her quiet, slightly plodding step and wondering who on earth it belongs to. She ducks her peroxided head at him, flashes her uncertain train-track smile. For six months now Olga has been embroiled in protracted dentistry. Beneath the metal braces her teeth are grey and disorderly. As a child her mother apparently never took her to the dentist. This was not out of neglect, Olga has told him. It was because Olga was frightened of going, and her mother couldn�&#x20ac;&#x2122;t bear her to be frightened, or to feel pain. She has told Thomas that she is saving up for a bridge and a set of caps. She has three different jobs and all the money goes on her teeth. She complains of the expense: in Poland the cost of dentistry is much lower. There, she could have all the work done �&#x20ac;&#x201c; �&#x20ac;&#x2dc;All!�&#x20ac;&#x2122; Olga repeats, making a chopping motion with her hand �&#x20ac;&#x201c; for what she pays here for just one monthly visit.</p><p>These conversations do not entirely engage Thomas. When he talks to Olga he is both there and not there. He is waiting for Tonie to come down, as the platform guard waits for the London train to come through. Tonie�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s appearances in the kitchen are brief. Like the train she stops, disgorging activity, and then departs again. It is a matter of minutes, but he needs to be ready. He hears Olga �&#x20ac;&#x201c; in some ways he even identifies himself with her, both of them platform dwellers �&#x20ac;&#x201c; but when she speaks he cannot reciprocate. He is as though sealed behind glass. He wonders if she realises this, realises that she can see but not touch him. She drinks tea from a giant Garfield mug and eats cereal, topping up the milk frequently from the plastic container that stands beside her bowl. He glimpses her bare, mushroom-coloured legs beneath the table, her feet clad in large soft slippers. He turns the music up a little: it is an offering, a form of explanation. He wants her to know that he is aware of his own limitations, of his failure to make anything of their conversations in the morning. Sometimes this failure appears to him as something intrinsic to time itself, as an inner force, like decay. They pass and are forgotten, these interludes in the kitchen. And yet they are always the same: he could stand here for a hundred years and still have much the same conversation with Olga. There are, it seems, limitless copies of this conversation, but it never goes anywhere or develops. By the same token, it never dies. It has no relationship to time. This may be because it lacks authenticity.</p><p>At seven-thirty Tonie comes down and Olga goes up. Olga has a cleaning job at the hospital: her shift starts at eight. Tonie gets the seven-fifty train. It interests Thomas to see that while Olga�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s priority is food, Tonie gives precedence to her appearance. She stays upstairs until the last possible minute, while Olga sits at the table for half an hour or more in her dressing gown, working at her mug and bowl. Upstairs doors bang, taps run, Tonie�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s footsteps stalk to and fro. Olga gets up and slowly carries her dishes to the sink, her slippers dragging and hissing across the floor, and reties her dressing-gown cord before beginning her unhurried ascent to her room. Sometimes she and Tonie pass on the stairs and Tonie says, �&#x20ac;&#x2dc;Hi, Olga,�&#x20ac;&#x2122; in a voice that is half whisper, very deep and throaty, very exotic and distrait, as though she has just disentangled herself from a situation that is too complex and passionate to explain. �&#x20ac;&#x2dc;Hello!�&#x20ac;&#x2122; Olga replies, cheerful as a trumpet.</p><p>The stairs run through the core of the tall, narrow house and the treads are uncarpeted. The footsteps go up and down them like arpeggios up and down a keyboard. To Thomas the rooms at the top have a sweet, tinkling atmosphere, light-filled and harmonious. The kitchen, where he stands in his dressing gown, is in the basement. It is deep and sonorous: it underpins the melody of the house with its static, structural confirmations. Tonie does not like being in the kitchen. She is always carrying things on trays up to the higher regions. She has taken down the curtains to let in more light. Sometimes she cleans it, thoroughly and punitively, but her feelings do not change. Thomas, however, is happy down here. He likes the atmosphere of the bass clef, its fundamentality, its insistence on necessities. It is in the basement that he has begun to consider time, and its relationship to authenticity. It is here that he has discovered an underlying structure, a plan. Often he doesn�&#x20ac;&#x2122;t change out of his dressing gown until eleven or twelve o�&#x20ac;&#x2122;clock. By then he is finished with the revelations of the bass clef. He turns off his music. He is ready to read. Reading, he admits, has to be done on a sofa, upstairs.</p><p>Tonie eats, drinks coffee, standing up at the counter. She wears bracelets that rattle when she lifts her cup to her lips and glances at her watch. She has, he thinks, an atmosphere of quest about her, of honour. She will join the seven-fifty as the soldier joins his departing regiment. She will not think about him all day; she will not think about Alexa, nor about the sun moving in golden panels across the floorboards of their room, the clock ticking in the hall, the sounds of cars and voices that drift in from the street and then vanish, the day passing through the house, passing irretrievably through its core, its very fibres. She will be valiant not to think about these things, but she will derive, he knows, a rudimentary pleasure from it too. It is the pleasure of self: Thomas knows because he has felt it himself. Once it was he who stood there, clean, bright-eyed, dressed for departure, and Tonie who remained behind to witness the day�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s passage. Did she wear a dressing gown? He isn�&#x20ac;&#x2122;t sure. He can�&#x20ac;&#x2122;t recall what she looked like when he was leaving her. She was part of a pattern, like a figure in a tapestry, woven into her setting.</p><p>She puts things into her bag. She says something, but the music is so loud that she has to repeat it, raising her voice. It is Schubert�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s Fantasiestücke. She says,</p><p>�&#x20ac;&#x2dc;I�&#x20ac;&#x2122;ve got a meeting. I won�&#x20ac;&#x2122;t be back before eight.�&#x20ac;&#x2122;</p><p>�&#x20ac;&#x2dc;Okay,�&#x20ac;&#x2122; he says loudly. �&#x20ac;&#x2dc;Fine.�&#x20ac;&#x2122;</p><p>He goes to turn the music down but it is too late. She has swung her bag over her shoulder and is moving towards the stairs.</p><p>Alexa is still asleep. She lies in her bed like a girl in a fairy tale. In sleep she is very soft. She exudes something, a kind of mist, as though when she sleeps she sets aside her solidity and takes on the transmutable properties of light and liquid and air. Thomas doesn�&#x20ac;&#x2122;t want to dwell too much on his daughter�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s beauty. He looks at her but he can give no name to his looking, no motive. He would like an artist to paint her. It would be easier to look at a painting of Alexa than at Alexa herself.</p><p>Later, downstairs, she sits at the table, neat in her uniform. She wears her hair precisely parted and brushed into a ponytail. She is so orderly: every day it is the same.</p><p>�&#x20ac;&#x2dc;Are you going to the shops today?�&#x20ac;&#x2122;</p><p>Thomas muses, rubbing his chin.</p><p>�&#x20ac;&#x2dc;I don�&#x20ac;&#x2122;t know,�&#x20ac;&#x2122; he says. �&#x20ac;&#x2dc;Why, what do you want?�&#x20ac;&#x2122;</p><p>�&#x20ac;&#x2dc;I need batteries.�&#x20ac;&#x2122;</p><p>He stands at the window, looking out at the garden. It is September. The year has always been fixed at this point, pinned to its backing of time like a butterfly in an exhibition case: September is the skewering place, the heart, where the pin of routine is thrust in. But this year it is different. For almost the first time in his life he has not gone back into harness at the summer�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s end. He has not returned to work: the pin has not been driven home. He is free or he is cast out, one or the other. Alexa is speaking to him.</p><p>�&#x20ac;&#x2dc;�&#x20ac;&#x201c; size for my clock,�&#x20ac;&#x2122; she says.</p><p>�&#x20ac;&#x2dc;What? What are you talking about?�&#x20ac;&#x2122;</p><p>�&#x20ac;&#x2dc;You need to get the right size for my clock.�&#x20ac;&#x2122;</p><p>�&#x20ac;&#x2dc;What clock?�&#x20ac;&#x2122;</p><p>�&#x20ac;&#x2dc;My alarm clock. It�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s stopped.�&#x20ac;&#x2122;</p><p>He sighs. A little thread of headache is inching across his brow. Why does an eight-year-old child need an alarm clock? It is the pin of routine again, searching for its mark. She is standing in front of him now.</p><p>�&#x20ac;&#x2dc;I�&#x20ac;&#x2122;ll try to remember,�&#x20ac;&#x2122; he says.</p><p>She has something in her hand. She places it on the counter in front of him.</p><p>�&#x20ac;&#x2dc;That�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s the size of battery you need,�&#x20ac;&#x2122; she says.</p><p>�&#x20ac;&#x2dc;Where did you get that?�&#x20ac;&#x2122;</p><p>�&#x20ac;&#x2dc;I took it out of the clock. It doesn�&#x20ac;&#x2122;t work any more. I need two. Please don�&#x20ac;&#x2122;t forget.�&#x20ac;&#x2122;</p><p>�&#x20ac;&#x2dc;I might forget. I said I�&#x20ac;&#x2122;ll try.�&#x20ac;&#x2122;</p><p>She is frustrated. She wants to impose her will on him, to exact his promise. It is artificial, this conversation.

It was not a struggle for office, or a contest about a tariff..., but a dispute that followed hard on a terrible civil war. It was the reconstruction of the Union that was at issue. </blockquote> <b>GENERAL ADAM BADEAU, 1887</b> <br> <p> AFTER FINISHING <i><b>The Summer of 1787</b></i> about the writing of the Constitution, I wanted to pick up the Constitution's story at its next critical moment. To form a union from thirteen quarreling states, the Philadelphia Convention patched together a number of rough compromises, prominent among them agreements about slavery and the allocation of power between the federal and state governments. Those political bargains held up for seventy years. During those decades, a web of accommodation and mutual forbearance bound the nation together. Three times, painful compromises over slavery kept the states united. Arguments over the powers of the sovereign states flared and subsided and flared anew. By 1861, contention over slavery and state powers overwhelmed the constitutional structure. Eleven Southern states seceded and fought a savage four-year war to be no part of the United States. </p><p> That war exposed fundamental flaws in the founding document. Slavery could no longer be papered over. It had to be abolished. The national government's power over the states had to be reinforced. A commitment to equality and the right to vote had to be embraced. From 1865 to 1870, the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments remade the Constitution in those ways. </p><p> Yet the central constitutional drama of this critical era was not the prolonged battle over the new amendments. Rather, the nation came closest to tearing itself apart, again, during the impeachment struggle between Congress and President Andrew Johnson in the spring of 1868. Accused by the House of Representatives of eleven offenses ("Articles of Impeachment"), Johnson endured a lengthy Senate impeachment trial, escaping conviction and removal from office by a single vote. </p><p> I first studied Johnson's impeachment trial twenty years ago, when I defended Walter L. Nixon, Jr., a federal judge from Mississippi, in an impeachment case before the Senate. I needed then to understand what offenses constitute "high crimes and misdemeanors" under the Constitution, and thus support impeachment. Naturally, I turned to the Johnson case, the only presidential impeachment trial to that point. My study yielded mostly confusion. </p><p> The principal players in the case were unfamiliar: Congressmen Thaddeus Stevens and Benjamin Butler led the prosecution; in opposition were former Supreme Court Justice Benjamin Curtis and attorney William Evarts. The eleven impeachment articles, which were the indictment of the president, were impenetrable, even for a lawyer. The S enate's rulings on legal issues -- what was a "high crime" or "high misdemeanor," and what evidence could be heard -- were inconsistent, even incoherent. Those seeking to drive Johnson from the White House were passionate, but the charges against him seemed technical and legalistic. The conflict focused on Johnson's attempt to fire his secretary of war. How, I wondered, could the president not have the power to do that? And yet Johnson almost was convicted on those baffling impeachment articles. </p><p> This time around, with greater time and study, I appreciated better how this confrontation grew from irreconcilable disagreements over how to reconstruct the nation after secession and civil war. Johnson was a Southern Democrat, elected on the Republican ticket in 1864, who became president because of the tragic assassination of Abraham Lincoln. Johnson took a narrow view of federal powers under the Constitution. Untroubled by gruesome racial violence in the South, or by the replacement of slavery with a brutal form of agricultural peonage, he wanted Union troops to withdraw quickly from the region. Sovereign Southern states, he believed, should be left to manage their own affairs. </p><p> Congress, overwhelmingly Republican and including no representatives from ten Southern states, disagreed. Congressional Republicans were enraged that former Confederates would be rewarded for their treason by swiftly regaining control over their states. Most Republicans wanted power in those "reconstructed" states to be reserved to men who had been loyal to the Union. They insisted that the freed slaves must be protected from white violence. Many wanted the freedmen to have the vote so they could elect state governments that would treat them fairly. </p><p> As the dispute between Johnson and congressional Republicans grew more rancorous, constitutional questions became central. Johnson insisted that he was defending the Constitution "as it is," preserving the original vision of the Founding Fathers. Congressional Republicans insisted that the Constitution, and the Union, had to change. When Congress resorted to its ultimate constitutional weapon against the president -- impeachment and removal from office -- calls to arms rang through the North and South. The nation's future hinged on whether impeachment would work well enough to prevent a plunge back into civil war. Could the Constitution mediate this fierce battle within the government itself? When the nation slid into civil war in 1861, the Constitution was no help. Would it perform any better seven years later? </p><p> This was a great testing for the Constitution and the nation. For many years, the conventional telling of the impeachment story portrayed it as a hairsbreadth escape from congressional despotism. By this traditional account, the presidency survived because a few heroic Republicans in the Senate refused to join the vengeful Northern harpies who hated Andrew Johnson for attempting to heal the nation's wounds. That conventional view is a cartoon version of the actual struggle, and ignores much of the historical record. As president, Johnson inflicted many more wounds on the nation than he healed, while votes for his acquittal were purchased with political deals, patronage promises, and even cash. </p><p> Andrew Johnson was an unfortunate president, an angry and obstinate hater at a time when the nation needed a healer. Those who opposed him were equally intemperate in word and deed. It was an intemperate time. The tempests of the Civil War still triggered high emotions. Yet Johnson's opponents, often described as demonic impeachers, defended the principles of fairness and equality that represent the finest parts of the American tradition, which they also were fighting to incorporate in the Constitution. The impeachment process proved cumbersome and exasperating, but ultimately achieved exactly the goal for which the Framers of the Constitution designed it: the peaceful resolution of a grave national crisis. </p><p> An unexpected part of the story is one that was difficult to see at the time and has been mostly ignored ever since: the corruption and bribery that surrounded the Senate trial. Though the passage of 140 years has covered many tracks, there remains substantial evidence that rogues and blackguards brandished fat wads of greenbacks and portfolios bulging with government appointments in order to keep Andrew Johnson in office, or to drive him out. The rascals included corrupt tax collectors, bent Indian agents, greedy financial manipulators, and political bosses. Assembling the facts surrounding these extraordinary events required historical detective work that was both fascinating and frustrating. The effort drew on my experiences as a criminal defense lawyer in cases involving private and public corruption. Though hard conclusions are elusive with this part of the story, the evidence paints an unsettling portrait of boodle and payoffs that might well have determined one of the critical moments in America's history. </p><p> As long as the Constitution holds the nation together, the story of the Johnson trial will be an important one. Twice in my lifetime, impeachment has stopped the nation in its mad rush to the great American future. Richard Nixon resigned in August 1974 rather than face the impeachment articles approved by the House Judiciary Committee. Bill Clinton was the second president in history to be impeached by the House of Representatives; after a brief proceeding in the Senate, he was acquitted on all charges. Yet those episodes pale when compared to the fervor that rocked the nation in 1868, when Andrew Johnson stood accused before the Senate sitting as a court of impeachment. At that moment, only the impeachment clauses of the Constitution stood between the nation and a second Civil War. </p><p> Copyright � 2009 by David O.

Despite the cold rain that was drenching Washington City, it should have been the most gratifying day of his fifty-six years. At noon, he would be sworn in as vice president of the United States. A man who never attended a day of school would become the nation's second-highest official. Still, despite the excitement of his own Inauguration Day, Johnson did not feel right. It might have been the lingering effects of a fever that had struck him over the winter.

But beyond these frontiers lay other lands, the lands of seemingly anarchic warrior tribes, the land of the Barbarians. The opening scenes of Gladiator are based on the victories of Marcus Aurelius over one such tribe, the Marcommani. Two hundered years later the Romans still seemed invincible, routing 30,000 Alamanii at the battle of Strasbourg. However, within a generation, the foundations of this order were shaken to their core, and Roman armies, as one contemporary put it, &#34;vanished like shadows&#34;. What had happened? Covering the last 100 years of Empire, a period full of great battles, treachery, and characters as wild as Attila the Hun, Peter Heather shows how the Empire gave way before the relentless and deliberate onslaught of the Huns, Goths and Vandals. These tribes, originating in Eastern Europe, finally conquered large tracts of the old Empire, sacking Rome itself and defeating Roman armies on land and sea.</p><p><p>In this ground-breaking book, Peter Heather proposes a new solution to one of the greatest mysteries of history: the demise of the Roman Empire. Mixing authoritative analysis with thrilling narrative, he brings fresh insight into the panorama of the empire&#x2019;s end, from the bejewelled splendour of the Imperial court to the dripping forests of &#x201c;Barbaricum&#x201d;. He examines the successes of the Roman Empire and uses a new understanding of its continued strength and enduring limitations to show how Europe&#x2019;s barbarians, transformed by centuries of contact with Rome, eventually pulled it apart.</p><p>&#x2018;Provides the reader with drama and lurid colour as well as analysis.

A trusted authority on baking, Beth Hensperger has brought together hundreds of time-tested recipes, both classic and intriguingly original, from Gruyere Pullman Loaf and Farm-Style White Bread with Cardamom to fragrant Tuscan Peasant Bread and Classic Buttermilk Biscuits. And don't just think loaves. Steamed Pecan Corn Bread, pancakes, golden brioches, flatbreads, focaccia, pizza dough, dinner rolls, dessert breads, strudels, breakfast buns -- the choices are endless. The recipes are foolproof, step-by-step, and easy-to-follow. Busy bakers will also appreciate the excellent selection of recipes for bread machines and food processors. With a glossary and easy-to follow tips such as how to store and reheat bread, <i>The Bread Bible</i> is "a keeper for anyone who likes to bake or plans to get started." -<i>Chicago Tribune</i></p><p>Weighing almost as much as a small child, Beth Hensperger's <i>The Bread Bible</i> contains 300 recipes, plus slice after slice of baking wisdom. Hensperger certainly knows her bread: she is the author of several other yeasty numbers, including the mouthwatering <i>Bread for All Seasons</i> and the feisty <i>Breads of the Southwest</i>. Her <i>Bible</i> features simple, basic breads, such as White Mountain Bread, French Bread, and an Old-Fashioned 100 Percent Whole-Wheat Bread, as well as fancier breads such as Brown Rice Bread with Dutch Crunch Topping and a tangy Anadama Bread with Tillamook Cheddar Cheese. Not forgotten are scones, biscuits, pizzas, croissants, waffles, muffins--and even coffee cakes. As can be expected from such a hefty, all-encompassing volume, many breads demand the skills of agile and able bakers. Crescia al Formaggio, an aesthetically pleasing savory cheese bread, requires scrupulous time-keeping and copious amounts of elbow grease and patience. Of course, the rewards are high. Happily, many other loaves can be whipped up in a bread machine, and are equally satisfying. An Old-Fashioned Oatmeal Bread using Irish oats makes everything good with the world with its rich, nutty texture. Hensperger's sweet treats are also a delight--the Blueberry Gingerbread works wonders with vanilla ice cream, and won't take up your whole day slaving over a hot stove. <p> Although <i>The Bread Bible</i> would have benefited from color photographs to tease the taste buds, Hensperger's latest ode to bread will still prove invaluable for both new and seasoned bakers. <i>--Naomi Gesinger</i></p>Beth Hensperger is an acclaimed San Francisco Bay Area-based food writer, cooking instructor, and bread maven who has written articles for Cooking Light , Shape , Bon Appetit , and Family Circle magazines among others and pens a weekly baking column in the San Jose Mercury News .</p><h2>Poppyseed (Serendipity Series)</h2><p>Poppyseed, the first calf born in the spring, learns the responsibility and pleasure to be had in being a big brother</p><p></p><h2>How to Make Love All Night (and Drive a Woman Wild)</h2><p>According to Dr. Barbara Keesling, who spent ten years as a sex therapist, any man can master the simple techniques presented in HOW TO MAKE LOVE ALL NIGHT (and Drive a Woman Wild).<br>In a forthright, practical, and lively style, Dr. Keesling provides a series of exercises and techniques for men to prolong lovemaking regardless of age or experience.

Bush. When Bush took office in 2001, the federal budget ran a surplus, the national debt stood at a generational low of 56 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), and unemployment clocked in at 4 percent&#x2014;which most economists consider the practical equivalent of full employment. The government&#x2019;s tax revenue amounted to $2.1 trillion annually, of which $1 trillion came from personal income taxes and another $200 billion from corporate taxes. Military spending totaled $350 billion, or 3 percent of GDP&#x2014;a low not seen since the late 1940s&#x2014;and not one American had been killed in combat in almost a decade. Each dollar bought 1.06 euros, or 117 yen. Gasoline cost $1.50 per gallon. Twelve years after the Berlin Wall came down, the United States stood at the pinnacle of authority: the world&#x2019;s only superpower, endowed with democratic legitimacy, the credible champion of the rule of law, the exemplar of freedom and prosperity.1<br> <br>Eight years later the United States found itself in two distant &#x201c;wars of choice&#x201d;; military spending constituted 20 percent of all federal outlays and more than 5 percent of the gross domestic product. The final Bush budget was $1.4 trillion in the red and the national debt was out of control. The nation&#x2019;s GDP had increased from $10.3 trillion to $$14.2 trillion during those eight years, but a series of tax cuts that Bush introduced had reduced the government&#x2019;s revenue from personal income taxes by 9 percent and corporate taxes by 33 percent. Unemployment stood at 9.3 percent and was rising; two million Americans had lost their homes when a housing bubble burst, and new construction was at a standstill. The stock market had taken a nosedive, the dollar had lost much of its former value, and gasoline sold for $3.27 a gallon.2 The United States remained the world&#x2019;s only superpower, but its reputation abroad was badly tarnished.<br> <br>Was Bush responsible? Perhaps not for the housing bubble or the disastrous collapse of high-risk investments in derivatives, except that he equated the American dream with home ownership and loosened oversight of the securities industry. Otherwise the answer is a resounding yes. Unprepared for the complexities of governing, with little executive experience and a glaring deficit in his attention span, untutored, untraveled, and unversed in the ways of the world, Bush thrived on making a show of his decisiveness. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not afraid to make decisions,&#x201d; he told a biographer. &#x201c;Matter of fact, I like this aspect of the presidency.&#x201d;3 But his greatest strength became his worst flaw. His self-confidence and decisiveness caused him to do far more damage than a less assertive president would have.<br> <br>The critical turning point came on September 12, 2001. Al Qaeda&#x2019;s attacks on the United States on 9/11 violated the universal norms of civilized society, and the immediate global outpouring of empathy for the U.S. was unparalleled. Accordingly, September 12 was a defining moment in American history: the United States was not only an economic powerhouse and a military superpower but also enjoyed unprecedented moral authority. Bush could have capitalized on that support but instead he squandered it. He strutted around like a cowboy and then picked a fight with Iraq.4<br> <br>By conflating the events of 9/11 and Saddam Hussein, Bush precipitated the deterioration of America&#x2019;s position abroad, led the United States into a $3 trillion war in Iraq that cost more than four thousand American lives and an unwinnable conflict in Afghanistan, promulgated an egregious doctrine of preventive war, alienated America&#x2019;s allies, weakened its alliances, and inspired young Muslims throughout the world to join the jihad.5 If Saddam and his secular regime had remained in power, the so-called Islamic State of Iraq could not have been created and the ISIS we know today would not exist. Domestically, the hysteria unleashed by his administration undermined civil liberty, eroded the rule of law, and tarnished respect for traditional values of tolerance and moderation.<br> <br>&#x201c;I am the war president,&#x201d; Bush once boasted, asserting sophomoric delight in military braggadocio.6 Neither Dwight Eisenhower nor Harry Truman would have called themselves &#x201c;the war president,&#x201d; even though a nuclear war between the United States and the Soviet Union could at any moment have taken 150 million lives in a few hours.7 George W. Bush had lived in his father&#x2019;s shadow all of his life: at Andover and Yale, in the oil business, and in politics. To crush Saddam Hussein, which George Herbert Walker Bush had declined to do, would afford him the rare opportunity to succeed where his father had failed.<br> <br>George W. Bush&#x2019;s legacy was a nation impoverished by debt, besieged by doubt, struggling with the aftereffects of the worst recession since the Great Depression, and deeply engaged in military conflicts of our own choosing. His tin ear for traditional conservative values, his sanctimonious religiosity, his support for Guant�namo, CIA &#x201c;renditions,&#x201d; and government snooping have eroded public trust in the United States at home and abroad. For eight years Bush made the decisions that put the United States on a collision course with reality. To argue that by taking the actions that he did, the president kept America safe is meretricious: the type of post hoc ergo propter hoc analysis that could justify any action, regardless of its impropriety. The fact is, the threat of terrorism that confronts the United States is in many respects a direct result of Bush&#x2019;s decision to invade Iraq in 2003.<br> <br>Bush was the decider. But he did not wrestle with the details of policy, particularly foreign policy. By contrast, FDR and Eisenhower determined every nuance of America&#x2019;s global stance. Roosevelt had no foreign policy adviser. Harry Hopkins was the president&#x2019;s personal emissary with foreign leaders, and Secretary of State Cordell Hull was relegated to diplomatic housekeeping. Under Eisenhower, the director of the NSC staff was merely an assistant to the president, not the national security adviser, and Ike always kept Secretary of State John Foster Dulles on a short leash.<br> <br>Bush took a different view of the chain of command. Not since the days of Warren Harding, Calvin Coolidge, and Herbert Hoover&#x2014;the Republican hands-off-the-ship-of-state trinity of the 1920s&#x2014;had a president been so detached from the detailed, day-to-day determination of policy alternatives. Bush saw issues in terms of black and white. There were no subtleties and no shades of gray. The war in Iraq was a biblical struggle of good versus evil&#x2014;something from the pages of the Book of Revelation. His decision to bring democracy to Iraq was equally arbitrary and unilateral. Bush&#x2019;s religious fundamentalism often obscured reality. And he expected his cabinet to fall into line, not debate possible alternatives.<br> <br>Bush was supported by a phalanx of subcabinet appointees, conservative in outlook, crisply articulate, and powerfully motivated to provide the intellectual justification for policies the president had decided upon: men like I. Lewis &#x201c;Scooter&#x201d; Libby, Paul Wolfowitz, Elliott Abrams, and Douglas Feith. Never before in American history has an administration come to power with a subcabinet echelon of like-minded ideologues, friends over the decades, dedicated to a common purpose, and armed with a game plan ready to be implemented. All had served in the administration of George H. W. Bush, and during the Clinton years formed a veritable government in exile. Their seminal policy statement had been drafted in 1991 by Wolfowitz and Libby, then serving as Secretary Dick Cheney&#x2019;s deputies in the Department of Defense, calling for American military superiority, emphasizing the power of the president to act unilaterally &#x201c;when international reaction proves sluggish,&#x201d; and advocating preemptive attack against rogue states seeking to acquire weapons of mass destruction.8<br> <br>In 1997, they, along with Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld, founded the Project for the New American Century, dedicated to increasing defense spending, challenging &#x201c;regimes hostile to U.S. interests and values,&#x201d; and explicitly advocating regime change in Iraq. Had it not been for 9/11, their manifesto would have been little more than a footnote in intellectual history. But with the terrorist attack, the administration&#x2019;s second echelon dusted off their agenda, Bush signed on, and the direction of the administration was defined. When George W. Bush left office in 2009, the U.S. defense budget exceeded the combined defense budgets of every major country in the world and was clearly unsustainable.9<br> <br>But the Bush administration was not without its accomplishments. Because of his Texas roots and his admirable freedom from racial prejudice, Bush was far more sympathetic than Clinton or his father to the plight of illegal immigrants, particularly those of Hispanic origin, and he pioneered the nation&#x2019;s first prescription drug program for seniors. No Child Left Behind may not be a perfect solution, but it reflected the president&#x2019;s concern to improve the nation&#x2019;s schools. And Bush led the international fight against AIDS and malaria. On the other hand, the Bush administration turned a blind eye to the growing environmental problems confronting the country and the globe, showed little interest in improving the nation&#x2019;s infrastructure, and downgraded federal regulatory activity, particularly in relation to Wall Street, noxious emissions, and mine safety.<br> <br>This book relates the life of George W. Bush&#x2014;his family heritage of investment banking and public service, his childhood in Midland, Texas (which by the late 1970s had the highest per capita income of any city in the United States), Andover, Yale, Harvard Business School, the Air National Guard, oil business, and the Texas Rangers baseball team. At Andover, George was a Big Man on Campus, and at Yale a solid fourth-quartile student. &#x201c;We need good men in the bottom quartile,&#x201d; an Ivy League dean of admissions once said. &#x201c;Men who won&#x2019;t jump out of a window if they get a D, and who might leave the university five million dollars.&#x201d;10<br> <br>Bush&#x2019;s personal life was at times unglued. Out of college and at loose ends, he often drank too much and was no stranger to prohibited substances. A premature and unsuccessful run for Congress in 1978 caused him to hesitate about entering politics. His marriage to Austin librarian Laura Welch in 1977, and his reentry into life as a born-again Christian in 1985, led him back to the straight and narrow.11 Bush&#x2019;s embrace of evangelical Christianity helped anchor him in the fundamentalist culture of contemporary Texas, and facilitated his effort to distance himself from his New England origins and Ivy League education. &#x201c;The biggest difference between me and my father,&#x201d; George W. was fond of saying, &#x201c;is that he went to Greenwich Country Day and I went to San Jacinto Junior High.&#x201d;12<br> <br>Bush flaunted his Texas roots while profiting from his family&#x2019;s establishment connections. For a dozen years he struggled to make a go of it in the oil business, and then struck pay dirt as the public face of the Texas Rangers. Dressed in cowboy boots and blue jeans, chewing tobacco and speaking with a West Texas twang, Bush became the J. R. Ewing of the American League West. In 1994 he rode his public prominence into the governor&#x2019;s mansion, defeating incumbent Democrat Ann Richards in a banner year for Republicans across the country.<br> <br>The Texas governorship is primarily a ceremonial post with virtually no executive responsibility&#x2014;scholars of government consider it the weakest in the nation&#x2014;and Bush thrived as a consensus builder and state cheerleader. Reelected overwhelmingly in 1998 in what had become the second most populous state in the nation, Bush was poised to seek the Republican presidential nomination in 2000. In 1930, Franklin Roosevelt&#x2019;s overwhelming reelection as governor of New York, then the nation&#x2019;s most populous state, made him the odds-on favorite for the Democratic nomination in 1932. Bush&#x2019;s victory in Texas served the same purpose. After overwhelming John McCain in the primaries, he was nominated virtually without opposition on the first ballot at the Republican convention in Philadelphia. Vice President Al Gore received the Democratic nomination in Los Angeles two weeks later, also on the first ballot.<br> <br>The election was Gore&#x2019;s to lose. The nation enjoyed unprecedented peace and prosperity, and Bush&#x2019;s slogan of &#x201c;compassionate conservatism&#x201d; initially fell on deaf ears. The country suffered Clinton fatigue, exacerbated by the Monica Lewinsky affair, but the president had survived impeachment efforts, and the issue seemed to be fading. If Gore could mobilize the Democratic base, he seemed a shoo-in.<br> <br>Whether it was overconfidence or incompetence, the Gore campaign got off to a shaky start. The selection of Connecticut&#x2019;s neoconservative Joe Lieberman as the party&#x2019;s vice presidential nominee found little resonance among African American and Latino voters, and Gore&#x2019;s failure to protect the party&#x2019;s left flank allowed third-party candidate Ralph Nader to siphon off almost three million traditional liberal voters. On the campaign trail, Gore appeared as lifeless as a wooden Indian. He refused to appear on the platform with President Clinton, and muffed his three debates with Bush.<br> <br>Even with Gore&#x2019;s miscues and an almost flawless campaign waged by Bush and vice presidential nominee Dick Cheney, the election was a cliffhanger. When the dust settled, Bush won thirty states with 271 electoral votes, although Gore enjoyed a slight plurality in the popular vote. In Florida, which Bush ultimately won by 537 votes out of the almost six million that were cast, the Democrats were again asleep at the switch.<br> <br>It was evident on election night that the Florida vote totals would be contested. The Republicans rushed more than one hundred lawyers to the state and spent over $12 million in legal fees. The Democrats made do with $3 million. The decision was fought out in the courts, and ultimately the Republicans prevailed. Given the complexities of the American electoral system, there can be no question that George W. Bush was legitimately installed as the nation&#x2019;s forty-third president. What is less clear is why President Clinton did not step in&#x2014;as Ulysses Grant had done in the contested Hayes-Tilden election of 1876&#x2014;to organize a special electoral commission to determine the electoral vote from Florida. It would have been a political solution to a political question and would have removed the taint that the Bush administration initially suffered from.<br> <br>I was not permitted to interview George W. Bush for this book. Vice President Cheney set up an interview for me with the former president, but just before it was to take place I received a telephone call from Logan Walters, Bush&#x2019;s personal assistant. &#x201c;The presiden...</p><h2>Principia Discordia *OP</h2><p>This book is the bible of Discordianism...the worship of Eris, the goddess of Chaos.

But the full repercussions of China's ascendancy-for itself and the rest of the globe-have been surprisingly little explained or understood. In this far-reaching and original investigation, Martin Jacques offers provocative answers to some of the most pressing questions about China's growing place on the world stage.<br><br> Martin Jacques reveals, by elaborating on three historical truths, how China will seek to shape the world in its own image. The Chinese have a rich and long history as a civilization-state. Under the tributary system, outlying states paid tribute to the Middle Kingdom. Ninety-four percent of the population still believes they are one race-"Han Chinese." The strong sense of superiority rooted in China's history promises to resurface in twenty-first century China and in the process strengthen and further unify the country.<br><br> A culturally self-confident Asian giant with a billion-plus population, China will likely resist globalization as we know it. This exceptionalism will have powerful ramifications for the rest of the world and the United States in particular. As China is already emerging as the new center of the East Asian economy, the mantle of economic and, therefore, cultural relevance will in our lifetimes begin to pass from Manhattan and Paris to cities like Beijing and Shanghai. It is the American relationship with and attitude toward China, Jacques argues, that will determine whether the twenty-first century will be relatively peaceful or fraught with tension, instability, and danger.<br><br> <i>When China Rules the World</i> is the first book to fully conceive of and explain the upheaval that China's ascendance will cause and the realigned global power structure it will create.</p><p>Martin Jacques co-edited and co-authored T<i>he Forward March of Labour Halted?, The Politics of Thatcherism</i>, and <i>New Times</i>. Jacques co-founded the UK think-tank Demos, has been a columnist for the <i>Times of London</i>, and was editor of <i>Marxism Today</i> and deputy editor of the <i>Independent</i>. He currently writes a regular column for the <i>Guardian</i> and is a visiting research fellow at the London School of Economics Asia Research Centre.From The Washington Post's Book World/washingtonpost.com Reviewed by Review by Seth Faison Martin Jacques, a British news columnist, became fascinated by the manic modernization underway in China when he visited in 1993. He saw construction cranes working round the clock, roads streaming with trucks and carts, and peasant women balancing wares on either end of a bamboo pole. The vibrant energy and evident willpower got Jacques musing: Would the economic boom follow the Western model? Or would China pursue modernity in its own way? Jacques went for a holiday in Malaysia. One day, while he was out for a run on the beach, his eye chanced upon a dark and attractive woman. A 26-year-old lawyer, she was not an obvious match for a pink-skinned, pointy-headed, chronically unmarried Brit who was nearing 50. But the woman, Hari Veriah, who was born in Malaysia to Indian parents, was fearless and modern-minded, and her Asian perspective was like tinder to his spark. As Veriah and Jacques spent time together, she challenged his assumptions and encouraged him to deepen his exploration of the East-vs.-West dynamic. His musings led to research. Trained in number-crunching and Marxist historical analysis and bolstered by extended sojourns in Asia, Jacques honed a convincing answer to his original question. For the better part of 15 years, with one tragic interruption, he dug and dug and then transformed his scholarly spadework into accessible, inviting prose. The result is "When China Rules the World," a compelling and thought-provoking analysis of global trends that defies the common Western assumption that, to be fully modern, a nation must become democratic, financially transparent and legally accountable. Jacques argues persuasively that China is on track to take over as the world's dominant power and that, when it does, it will make the rules, on its own terms, with little regard for what came before. China is growing at a tremendous rate. Yet it refuses to follow the Western model of establishing genuine elections, an independent judiciary and a freely convertible currency. In fact, its restrictive currency rules have made China the world's leading creditor, while the United States sinks ever deeper into debt. And while the United States sacrifices the lives of its soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan, the Chinese make money in both countries without losing a drop of blood. Jacques is a superb explainer of history and economics, tracing broad trends with insight and skill. He does not shy away from the considerable challenges China faces. Yet he glosses over Mao's terrors too easily. He stumbles badly when trying to describe what a new Chinese-led international order might look like, implausibly imagining a return of the old tributary system, where small neighboring states paid in gifts and gold to the reigning power: China. His theories about the significance of a Chinese "civilization" over a Chinese "nation" seem silly and misplaced. Books about the future never get it right. But this one offers tasty meat to chew on. Its prime achievement is to identify and then annihilate what may be the greatest flaw in Western thinking today: the assumption that economic and political progress must follow the Western model. Like the Brits and the Romans before us, we Americans may be unable to see the end of empire until it is too late. Personally, I felt humbled by Jacques's insights. As a journalist who lived and breathed China for years, I felt sure that the Communist Party, following its loss of credibility at Tiananmen, would fall to ashes. During the boom of the 1990s, I knew that economic modernization would force Chinese institutions to become accountable and democratic. I was wrong again and again. My assumptions were out of date. Still, one can't help wondering if China's trajectory, as unwavering as it may look now, may fizzle. Take, for instance, China's inability to accept or integrate outsiders -- Jacques calls it "the Middle Kingdom mentality." He explores it and China's prevalent racism in detail, for reasons that grew from painful experience. Jacques and Veriah married and moved to Hong Kong, where she suffered an epileptic seizure and was hospitalized. She warned Jacques that the Chinese medical staff was treating her like a third-class citizen because of her dark skin and Indian ancestry. The next day she died. Jacques later determined that negligence by the hospital staff had killed her. Left with their 1-year-old son, Jacques was devastated. It was two years before he could pick up a pen. When he did, his work was infused with a passion that honors the woman who brought him to rethink his approach to China. Her death stands as a symbol of China's dark limitations and leaves us with questions about its future. bookworld@washpost.com <br>Copyright 2009, The Washington Post.

Oscar, a nervous Anglican minister who gambles on the instructions of the Divine, joins forces with Lucinda, a teenaged heiress who buys a glassworks to help liberate her sex. The resulting narrative tangle of love, commerce, religion, and colonialism culminates in a half-mad expedition to transport a glass church across the Outback. In <i>True History of the Kelly Gang</i>, the legendary Australian outlaw Ned Kelly speaks for himself, scribbling his narrative in semiliterate but magically descriptive prose as he flees from the police. To his pursuers, Kelly is nothing but a monstrous criminal, but to his own people he is a hero defying the authority of the English. In a dazzling act of ventriloquism, Peter Carey brings the famous bushranger wildly and passionately to life.</p><p>PETER CAREY is a two-time winner of the Booker Prize. His other honors include the Commonwealth Writers' Prize and the Miles Franklin Literary Award. Born in Australia, he has lived in New York City for more than twenty-five years.<br><br>PAUL GILES is the Challis Professor of English at the University of Sydney and author of numerous books, including <i>The Global Remapping of American Literature</i> and <i>Transnationalism in Practice</i>.excerpt from the Introduction by Paul Giles<br><br><i>Oscar and Lucinda</i>, first published in 1988, and <i>True History of the Kelly Gang</i>, which appeared twelve years later, both won the Booker Prize for their Australian-born author, Peter Carey. Carey thus became only the second Australian to win the Booker, following Thomas Keneally&#x2019;s <i>Schindler&#x2019;s Ark</i> (<i>Schindler&#x2019;s List</i> in the US), which had achieved this distinction in 1982. Literary prizes are by their nature an odd hybrid of literary distinction and marketing management &#x2013; Carey himself observed in 2014 how &#x2018;a life spent lusting after prizes is bound to be unhappy&#x2019; &#x2013; but they do usefully draw attention for cultural historians to how fortunes have fluctuated within the literary world. Both <i>Oscar and Lucinda</i> and <i>True History of the Kelly Gang</i> evoke historical milieux from the second half of the nineteenth century, worlds reconstructed in part according to the stylistic tenets of magical realism, and they both address the interface between Australian culture and the extensive global reach of the British Empire at that time. Some of Carey&#x2019;s other novels &#x2013; such as <i>The Tax Inspector</i> (1991), set in the Sydney suburbs, or <i>Amnesia</i> (2014), which addresses US political interference in Australia &#x2013; are more overtly engaged with contemporary social issues, but arguably his best and most enduring works of fiction have been those set in earlier historical periods.<br><br>Carey has acknowledged being influenced by celebrated Latin American magic realists such as Jorge Luis Borges and Gabriel Garc&#x131;a Marquez, and he paid tribute to the latter after his death in 2014 by saying Marquez &#x2018;changed the way I wrote&#x2019;. Nevertheless, in his 2006 Paris Review interview Carey suggested that he considered himself principally &#x2018;at home with . . . Salman Rushdie and Derek Walcott and most writers from the former British Empire&#x2019;, and his own fiction adumbrates aspecifically Anglophone version of magical realism, one that intertwines realms of the fantastic and fabulous with a more assiduous focus on the nuances and complications of a recognizable social world. Though Carey moved from Australia to&nbsp;New York in 1989, at the age of forty-six, he observed in 2014 how &#x2018;Australia is my lens, I cannot see the world any other way.&#x2019; But this antipodean &#x2018;lens&#x2019; affords him the opportunity not only to relate Australian culture to a wider &#x2018;world&#x2019;, but also to clarify the significance of localized scenarios with a broader international context. Carey said of <i>True History of the Kelly Gang</i> that he thought it had been an advantage to write the novel in New York, since that alien location &#x2018;reminded me that people didn&#x2019;t know the story, so I couldn&#x2019;t assume anything, and that made the story better&#x2019;. Carey&#x2019;s work thus preserves an astute aesthetic balance between empathy and strategic distance, entering fully into the minds and hearts of his characters but also deploying techniques of alienation, in the Brechtian sense of that term, so as to set an interrogative frame around these fictional scenarios.<br><br>For <i>Oscar and Lucinda</i>, Carey undertook a great deal of historical research into the conditions of nineteenth-century England. He admits to feeling daunted about this at first, thinking &#x2018;I had no right to possess the English past, that it was not my past but their past&#x2019;; yet as the book&#x2019;s narrative unfolds, the significance of both temporal and spatial intersections across various times and regions becomes more evident. Just as Carey&#x2019;s fiction encompasses different places, so it superimposes different time frames upon one another. Of his 1997 novel J<i>ack Maggs</i>, which engages intertextually with the character of the transported convict Magwitch in Charles Dickens&#x2019;s <i>Great Expectations</i>, Carey demurred from reducing his novel to the category of &#x2018;historical fiction&#x2019; by saying: <br><br>"People talk about historical fiction, but for me, in Australia, <i>Jack Maggs</i> addresses contemporary life. It was published at a time when Australians were still squabbling among themselves about whether Australia was going to be a republic. The issues of <i>Jack Maggs</i> are being played out in this argument about the republic and whether they are going to go and sit by the fire with the Queen of England having cakes and ale or whether they are going to understand their situation. To label it historical fiction is to risk misunderstanding its context."<br><br>With <i>Oscar and Lucinda</i>, similarly, there is an explicit invocation of how the narrator is approaching this story from a retrospective angle: he describes Theophilus Hopkins as &#x2018;my great-great-grandfather&#x2019;, while also making occasional mention of much later events, such as the floods of 1955 or how a bridge in the Sydney suburb of Balmain was located &#x2018;where Mullens Street is these days&#x2019;. Though the narrative is set in the nineteenth century, it is framed in relation to a twentieth-century context.<br><br>The more complex correlation between past and present in <i>Oscar and Lucinda</i> involves the way all the novel&#x2019;s characters find themselves caught up in one way or another with dilemmas involving questions of interpretation. Victorian Christianity at the time this novel takes place felt itself to be under threat from scientific works such as Charles Darwin&#x2019;s <i>On the Origin of Species</i> (1859), which postulated a much more extensive timescale for Earth than that laid down in the Bible and led toheated debates among the clergy about whether the Bible should be understood as literal or as metaphorical truth. Such theological controversies run all through Carey&#x2019;s novel, as exemplified in Theophilus&#x2019;s Puritan fundamentalism (he &#x2018;read the Bible as if it were a report compiled by a conscientious naturalist&#x2019;), his son Oscar&#x2019;s instinctive reading of a storm at sea as &#x2018;a sign from God&#x2019; (Oscar is said to be &#x2018;still more Plymouth Brethren than he liked to think&#x2019;), the Reverend Dennis Hasset&#x2019;s &#x2018;Broad Church&#x2019; preference for understanding the Virgin Birth as a metaphorical idea, Bishop Dancer&#x2019;s &#x2018;old Toryschool&#x2019; suspicion of Hasset as &#x2018;a Latitudinarian&#x2019;, and so on. All of this is commensurate also with the tendency of characters to misinterpret one another&#x2019;s everyday actions, as for example with Oscar&#x2019;s assumption that Dennis Hasset is Lucinda&#x2019;s lover, a mistake that highlights the general liability within this novel to interpretative errors of various kinds. The emphasis throughout the book on gambling &#x2013; Oscar is an &#x2018;Obsessive&#x2019; gambler, Lucinda a &#x2018;Compulsive&#x2019; gambler &#x2013; represents another version of issues around prediction, predestination and providence, relating them to a more secular context. In this sense, the architectural structure of the book resembles a mise en ab&#x131;me,with the narrator&#x2019;s reconstruction and interpretation of this&nbsp;nineteenth-century past being mirrored in the attempts of his fictional characters to chart and predict the future. Hence the book balances its very specific dates &#x2013; the narrative is setmostly in the 1860s, contemporaneous with the American Civil War, which is mentioned occasionally &#x2013; against a sense of its historical situation always being refracted through an interpretative lens.<br><br>Nevertheless, the social exactitude and careful detail woven into <i>Oscar and Lucinda</i> militate against any sense of the bookbeing merely a dry metafictional exercise. For example, the play with interpretation and its limits is comically highlighted when Bishop Dancer wreaks havoc by attempting his favourite party piece of pulling a cloth off the Dean&#x2019;s table, a stunt that sends crockery flying in all directions and leads the narrator to comment: &#x2018;The cloth was, likewise, pulled out from under Oscar&#x2019;s life. But do not imagine that the Bishop&#x2019;s party trick was metaphorical, for were it so it would not be equal to the devastation.&#x2019; In Carey&#x2019;s bilateral formulations, the irreducible stuff of the material world sends things spinning in opposite directions by always trumping various theoretical designs imposed from without. Such a logic of paradox is also relevant to the book&#x2019;s central design of a glass church, the key image with which Carey said this novel imaginatively started. In her critical work <i>Victorian Glassworlds</i>, Isobel Armstrong described how glass was linked during the nineteenth century to anaesthetic style of transcendence, a medium through which corporeal substance might be refined into a replica of spirit, and the representation of glass in Carey&#x2019;s novel similarly evokes a tension between the materiality of the world and its transposition into rarefied forms of ideation. Oscar feels that glass is &#x2018;the gross material most nearly like the soul, or spirit&#x2019;, while Lucinda becomes known as &#x2018;the Glass Lady&#x2019;, with the novel positioning itself on a liminal border between embodied and transcendent states. One of the most recognizable and rewarding aspects of <i>Oscar and Lucinda</i>, however, is that its characters do not conform readily to preconceived templates or stereotypes of any kind. Lazy Oxford scoundrel Ian Wardley-Fish gets on well with his diligent fellow student Oscar, whom he calls &#x2018;Odd Bod&#x2019;.&nbsp;Wardley-Fish &#x2013; who &#x2018;did not go in for interpretation. It made him feel uncomfortable&#x2019; &#x2013; nevertheless finds himself later enjoying Theophilus Hopkins&#x2019;s naturalist account of his home environment, Hennacombe Rambles. Theophilus himself disapproves of Oscar&#x2019;s theology but still prays for him. Dennis Hasset is reported, &#x2018;peculiar though it might seem&#x2019;, to have &#x2018;agreed&#x2019; with the Bishop&#x2019;s decision to send him away to aremote parish, on the grounds that he &#x2018;did not feel his faith sufficiently&#x2019;. One of the most remarkable qualities about this novel is the way abstract ideas come into collision with contingent situations and quotidian circumstances that do not readily accord with regular types or expectations, thereby creating attraction and friction that brings these characters vividly to life. The luminous textual details help to create this effect &#x2013; for example, the way Oscar&#x2019;s &#x2018;trousers rucked up to show a bony white shin with red garter marks left, like a high-water mark, above the fallen socks&#x2019; &#x2013; but so does the broader sense of human beings as erratic phenomena with mixed motives and split selves.<br><br>Lucinda Leplastrier herself is the most obvious manifestation of this kind of split personality. One half of her thinks Dennis Hasset &#x2018;a weak fool and a poor friend&#x2019;, but it &#x2018;coexisted with this other part that loved him&#x2019;. When Dennis Hasset first shakes Lucinda&#x2019;s hand, he is struck by &#x2018;the infinite complexity of Creation&#x2019;, recognizing in her handshake &#x2018;the wild passage of blood on the other side of its wall, veins, capillaries, sweatglands, tiny factories in the throes of complicated manufacture&#x2019;. Carey studied chemistry and zoology at Monash Universityin Melbourne, and here, as in some of his other novels, the author&#x2019;s specialist scientific knowledge is apparent in the way he represents the human system as a physiological instrument as much as an elevated consciousness. This again contributes to his characters being responsive to multiple pressures simultaneously. Carey has said that he particularly relishes the &#x2018;pleasures of the novel&#x2019; because it&#x2019;s &#x2018;so much more interesting&#x2019; than short fiction, with the novel&#x2019;s more expansive genre enabling an author to &#x2018;go so far beyond what you know and what you think&#x2019;, and <i>Oscar and Lucinda</i> is perhaps the prime example within Carey&#x2019;s oeuvre of a multifaceted cast of characters&nbsp;driven by contradictory impulses of one kind and another.&nbsp;<br><br>Believing that &#x2018;a great novelist must be many and no-one&#x2019;, Carey in his 2010 address to the Sydney Writers&#x2019; Festival explicitly rejected the kind of critical reading intent upon &#x2018;extracting the message&#x2019; according to some &#x2018;pedagogic norm&#x2019;. There is certainly a feisty feminist aspect to Lucinda, who deliberately conceals her identity as a woman in her business affairs, with the gender politics of the novel being reinforced by the report of the association of Lucinda&#x2019;s mother in London with &#x2018;her old friend Marian Evans&#x2019;, the real name of George Eliot, who assumed her public nom de plume for similarly androgynous purposes. In Gillian Armstrong&#x2019;s attractive 1997 film of this novel, where Lucinda is played by Cate Blanchett, the complications of Victorian theology remain relatively understated and the role of the entrepreneurial heroine looms larger. Yet Carey&#x2019;s own fictional prose retains a density through which the charisma of individual personality finds itself necessarily negotiating with an opaque and complex social world. In 2010, another novel by Carey set in the nineteenth century, <i>Parrot and Olivier in America,</i> was once again shortlisted for the Booker Prize, leading English poet Andrew Motion, who was chair of the Booker judging panel that year, to liken Carey to Dickens; and something of the intractable quality of Dickens&#x2019;s incorrigibly variegated world is apparent in <i>Oscar and Lucinda</i>, whose artistic resonance lies precisely in its experiential irreducibility and its fine-grained detail.<br>...</p><h2>Tacky and the Emperor (Tacky the Penguin)</h2><p>It&#x2019;s common knowledge that Tacky was never the best- dressed penguin, but when he and his friends prepare for the arrival of the emperor, Tacky gets carried away and ends up in more than just elegant attire!<br> Tacky brings his own unique brand of humor and entertainment to the emperor&#x2019;s visit. Here is another wacky addition to Tacky&#x2019;s myriad adventures in which friendship, kindness, and laughter always win out! Tacky fans will be carried to new heights of hilarity by this latest Tacky tale.</p><p><p><b>Helen Lester </b>has written many hilarious and popular picture books, including the Tacky the Penguin series and <i>Hooway for Wodney Wat. </i>She lives in New York. www.helenlester.com</p>Tacky, the delightful penguin who marches (or is it waddles?) to a different drummer is back in another funny and charming tale-this time involving a royal visit from the emperor. When Tacky and his five iceberg-mates learn that the emperor is coming to visit, they enter into frenzied preparations. A feast of fish-flavored food is prepared, entertainment is rehearsed, and Tacky is put in charge of the balloons. But when he blows up a really big balloon, he takes an unplanned ride and ends up on a neighboring iceberg, which, unbeknownst to Tacky, is the emperor's home. Seeing a set of very fancy clothes lying unattended and unclaimed on the ice, he puts them on and waddles back to his own iceberg. To his amazement, his five friends make a huge fuss over him, plying him with food and making sure he's amused and happy. Although Tacky doesn't realize it, his friends have mistaken him for the emperor. When the real emperor arrives, the five others are mortified that there is nothing left with which to impress him, and are exasperated with Tacky. The emperor, who turns out to be sick to death of the stuffy and formal visits most of his subjects make him sit through, has a great time with Tacky and his improvisations. Instead of the fish-flavored food that the emperor is usually offered, they have snowball cones; instead of a boring dance recital, Tacky sings his favorite silly song; and they all (even his royal highness) tell penguin jokes. The watercolor illustrations are adorable and full of humor-note especially the fish-flavored ice cream, the emperor's twinkle-toed shoes, and the double-page spread on which the penguins learn about the mistake that's been made. Children will think this book is a riot and won't even realize that a message is being delivered-a charming one about the joys of non-conformity.

She delves into matters of the home, the comfort of family, the beauty of Alaska, and the dislocation of divorce. </p><p> Frank and honest, serious and suddenly playful, <em>A Night Without Armor</em> is a talented artist's intimate portrait of what makes us uniquely human. </p></p><p>Jewel Kilcher was the first to admit that this book of 100 or so of her poems would not have been published if her dazzling debut album, <i>Pieces of You</i>, hadn't sold 10 million copies. And granted, Jewel is not going to replace Deborah Garrison's <i>A Working Girl Can't Win</i> on anybody's hit parade of serious poets who write for regular people.<p> But--shockingly!--Jewel's book of poetry is solid by celeb-poet standards, and a fair bit of it is actually sort of readable in its own right. Maybe it's not a bad idea to raise your kids on an 80-acre Alaskan farm with plenty of chores and no TV, as Mr. Kilcher did. Unlike most young people, let alone overnight stars, Jewel has led a life of some intrinsic interest. While they're often prosaically straightforward, her poems about rescuing a newborn calf in the midnight snow, listening to wolves howl in a canyon storm, and racing naked out of a sauna of a winter evening bring us more useful experience than kid poets usually have to share. Some of Jewel's homesteading verse is no worse than some of Gary Snyder's late nature poems; though she'll never write nature poems remotely as good as his early work <i>Riprap</i>, neither will he, probably. Preachiness is the enemy of both poets' deep religious impulses.</p><p> Jewel's poems about dumping a lover or thrilling to parking-lot sex "between the moon and a Chevrolet" are perceptive, at points even evocative. Her ode to her own breasts as a nest for her beloved is no good, but it's an honest failure. Her dress at the Oscars was more embarrassing.</p><p> The music critics contend that Jewel's music is influenced by Joni Mitchell, though Jewel claims she didn't listen to her until lately. In comparing <i>Joni Mitchell: The Complete Poems and Lyrics</i> with Jewel's book, we find that both use the image of the cactus for a heart that resists a restricting embrace, but that Mitchell is cleverer with language. When Joni's lover is away, "Me and them lonesome blues collide / The bed's too big, / The frying pan's too wide." Meanwhile, Jewel baldly observes, "I miss you miserably, dear / and I can't quite manage / to face this unbearably / large bed / alone."</p><p> On the other hand, Jewel does conclude with a nice image for toughing it out with a sentimental gesture--she shaves her armpits with his razor and cheap hotel soap. Ow! We feel her pain. Also, Jewel's "Underage" holds its own against Mitchell's "Raised on Robbery," while demonstrating the influence that probably outweighed Mitchell in Jewel's artistic development: her dad, with whom she played gigs as a child in Alaska.</p><p> </p><blockquote> I hung out once in the bathroom of Trade Winds Harley bar in Anchorage<br> With several biker chicks for company until the cops had left.<br> They had pale skin and thick black eye makeup<br> And they asked me to sing at their weddings.<br> I said I'd ask my dad.<p> We all sat on the counter and waited for the pigs to leave.<br> Some guy OD'd and was outside foaming at the mouth.</p><p> I remember looking in the mirror<br> And seeing this white face,<br> My shirt all buttoned up.<br> The women were nice to me<br> And looked like dark angels<br> Beside me. I liked them,<br> And together we waited<br> Patiently for the cops to leave<br> So I could go back out<br> And join my dad up<br> On stage. </p></blockquote><p> The great peril for Jewel, as for most poets when very young, is artless sincerity. Her poem about her dad's Vietnam War trauma is dead sentiment, but she does far better in "Grimshaw," about a Vietvet who came to watch the Kilchers play, perpetually requesting "Ain't Goin' to Study War No More" and drinking four quarts of beer a night until the day he shot his face off. Which made little Jewel vow to deal with her own emotions sooner rather than too late.</p><p> Careless editing permitted Jewel to misspell the names of Tom Waits and Charles Bukowski and the word "peek." Most young fans won't notice, and the very poems about love troubles that older readers will find gratingly obvious will strike them as headline news to be taken to heart. <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p><p>A bestselling writer of poetry and prose, Jewel is also an actress and performer. She has recorded four bestselling albums and also starred in Ang Lee's film <em>Ride with the Devil.</em> Her first book, <em>A Night Without Armor,</em> was a <em>New York Times</em> bestseller.

Raised on a Wisconsin farm in a family of "irrepressible individualists," Georgia O'Keeffe is a self-reliant child who decides early to become an artist. She works steadily toward that goal, attending art schools and teaching when family misfortunes dictate. In 1916, a friend sends some of her drawings to Alfred Steiglitz, renowned photographer and champion of avant-garde art. He promptly exhibits them, proclaiming that they reveal "a woman on paper." Furious at his presumption, Georgia O'Keefe confronts him. They become lovers and later marry, beginning an energetic collaboration that lasts until his death. She wants to have a baby, but he insists that she choose between motherhood and art. He promotes her work, which immediately becomes famous for its sexually-suggestive imagery, an interpretation she resolutely denies. Finding it increasingly difficult to live in his orbit, she gradually establishes a pattern of spending six months with him in New York and six months apart in New Mexico, her "spiritual home." By the time Alfred Steiglitz dies in 1946, Georgia O'Keeffe has firmly established herself as an artist. "Besides having a rich talent, ambition, assistance, and virtually no doubt about the validity of her vision, O'Keeffe had the brains to match her artistic gift and guide its flowering." As she examines Georgia O'Keeffe's complex personality, her choices and her reactions to the social and physical landscape around her, Laurie Lisle succeeds in drawing an inspiring portrait of a truly original, courageous woman. <i>-- For great reviews of books for girls, check out Let's Hear It for the Girls: 375 Great Books for Readers 2-14</i>. -- <i>From 500 Great Books by Women; review by Lynne Auld</i></p><h2>Every Prophecy of the Bible: Clear Explanations for Uncertain Times by One of Today&#39;s Premier Prophecy Scholars</h2><p><p><b>Prophecy is much more than the events predicted in the Book of Revelation</b></p> <p>It is not just for Bible scholars, pastors, and seminary students.

Out there on the high plains, among the Sioux reservations and the silent buttes, among the small towns dying and the people with them, you can hear the wind. And on the back of the wind is the sound of an old accordion&#x2014;tangos&#x2014;mingling with the lonely thump of a single drum in the nighttime and a far-off warrior&#x2019;s cry. On the back of the wind is the smell of worn saddle leather and sawdust, of sandalwood, and smoke from ancient ceremonial fires. To this, to a town called Salamander, comes Carlisle McMillan, a traveler and master carpenter seeking a place of quiet amid the grinding roar of progress. Near Wolf Butte, a strange and apparently haunted monolith, he finds his quiet, or so he believes, and begins rebuilding a decrepit house as a tribute to the gruff old man who taught him a carpenter&#x2019;s skills, rebuilding his life at the same time.<br><br>He finds two very different, independent women: Gally Deveraux, who works at a diner in Salamander and longs for something more than she is, and Susanna Benteen, beautiful and enigmatic, who was drawn to Salamander for mysterious reasons of her own, a woman the town has labeled a witch. The women and his carpenter&#x2019;s trade and an old Indian known as Flute Player bring Carlisle a sense of contentment for a while. But his quiet is shattered as bulldozer treads begin to turn and the Yerkes County War commences. Run or stand your ground, that is Carlisle&#x2019;s dilemma, Gally on one side, Susanna on the other.<br><br>Robert James Waller&#x2019;s fully imagined characters become people we know and care for deeply.<br><br><i>High Plains Tango</i> is the hauntingly lyrical story of a small town in the middle of nowhere, a town that forever changed&#x2014;and was forever changed by&#x2014;one man.</p><p>In an Author's Note at the end of <i>High Plains Tango</i>, Robert Jaems Waller says: "Though this book stands by itself, it is a continuation of two of my other books: <i>The Bridges of Madison County</i> and, especially, <i>A Thousand Country Roads</i> ... <i>A Thousand Country Roads</i> details Carlisle McMillan's search for his father, Robert Kincaid, who played a central role in <i>The Bridges of Madison County</i>."<p> Waller just can't, try as he might, get back to Madison County. Even though there are those who love to trash Bridges as sentimental twaddle, there are legions more who celebrate it as a romantic tour de force. Whichever side you favor, let it be said that the book delivers exactly what it promises. Not quite true of this book. What promises to be a romance of Waller-like proportions turns into an environmental crusade which turns down the heat, and then switches back to romance and do-goodery. </p><p> Carlisle McMillan, Stanford graduate (which comes in handy later on) and wanderer, floats into the town of Salamander, South Dakota, one afternoon and decides to stay. It is far enough away from anything that smacks of "city" to be appealing. He buys property with a derelict house on it and rebuilds it in honor of his mentor, Cody Marx. Cody taught him everything he knows about fine carpentry, and about doing it right, even when it doesn't show. Cody's Way is a metaphor for house building and character building, and Carlisle has learned his lessons well.</p><p> There are two women in this tale: Gally Devereaux, married to a big jerk who has the good grace to die, and Susanna Benteen, the auburn-haired beauty who dances naked in the firelight. Does anybody but Waller know women like this? Things are perking along just fine until the long arm of Progress reaches all the way to Salamander, deciding to build a highway, and spoils everything.</p><p> There is a lyrical last chapter reminiscent of some of the best-remembered of Waller's prose, and a toast offered by Carlisle's mother, Wynn: "To ancient evenings and distant music." Sound familiar? <i>--Valerie Ryan</i></p>Robert James Waller lives quietly with his wife, Linda, and their dogs and cats on a small farm in the Texas Hill Country, where he pursues his long-standing interests in writing, photography, music, economics, and mathematics. In the Texas evenings, he wades remote Hill Country streams, fly-fishing for bass and trout.</p><h2>Temple to the Wind: The Story of America&#39;s Greatest Naval Architect and His Masterpiece, Reliance</h2><p>One of history's most famous yachts, and the giants who made it.<br></p><p>Reliance was a yacht like no other, built in 1903, at the end of the age of sail. A marvel of her time, Reliance's topsail yard towered nearly 190 feet above the water, with sails stretching 202 feet from the bowsprit to the boom's end. Many said Reliance, carrying more sail than any single-masted boat before, was simply too dangerous to sail, but the stakes were awesome. By the turn of the century, racing for the America's Cup had become more than a gentleman's game. In 1903 it was an all-or-nothing contest-fraught with political tension-between two great rivals, Britain and America.<br>Behind Reliance was a gallery of American greats. There was Nathanael Greene Herreshoff, America's greatest yacht designer, also known as the Wizard of Bristol. And there were the robber barons like J. P. Morgan, James J. Hill, William Rockefeller, and Cornelius Vanderbilt III, who had made America an industrial force to be reckoned with. Such men spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to win the America's Cup, but they weren't willing to bankroll the contest indefinitely and endeavored to build a boat so powerful it would discourage the British for years to come. On the other side of the Atlantic, however, Sir Thomas Lipton, scrappy founder of the Lipton tea and grocery empire, was determined to win and put his personal fortune behind the construction of an equally bold challenger, his Shamrock III.<br>From conception to construction, through hair-raising sea trials-including fatalities during the testing of the yachts-to the grand finale of a race like no other, author Christopher Pastore brings to life this most beautiful and dangerous vessel, as well as the hearts it won and the hearts it broke.

Twenge, Ph.D.,</b> is a widely published associate professor of psychology at San Diego State University. Her research has appeared in <i>Time, USA Today, The New York Times,</i> and <i>The Washington Post,</i> and she has been featured on <i>Today</i> and <i>Dateline</i> and National Public Radio's <i>All Things Considered.</i> She holds degrees from the University of Chicago and the University of Michigan. Dr. Twenge lives with her husband in San Diego, California.Introduction<p>Linda was born in 1952 in a small town in the Midwest. After she graduated from high school in 1970, she moved to the city and enrolled in secretarial school. It was a great time to be young: Free Love was in, and everybody smoked, drank, and had a good time. Linda and her friends joined a feminist consciousness-raising group, danced at the discos, and explored their inner lives at est seminars and through meditation. The new pursuit of self-fulfillment led Tom Wolfe to label the 1970s the "Me Decade," and by extension the young people of the time the "Me Generation."</p><p>Compared to today's young people, they were posers.</p><p>Linda's Baby Boomer generation grew up in the 1950s and early 1960s, taught by stern, gray-suit-wearing teachers and raised by parents who didn't take any lip and thought that <i>Father Knows Best.</i> Most of the Boomers were well into adolescence or adulthood by the time the focus on the self became trendy in the 1970s. And when Linda and her friends sought self-knowledge, they took the ironic step of doing so en masse -- for all their railing against conformity, Boomers did just about everything in groups, from protests to seminars to yoga. Their youthful exploration also covered a very brief period: the average first-time bride in the early 1970s had not yet celebrated her 21st birthday.</p><p>Today's under-35 young people are the real Me Generation, or, as I call them, Generation Me. Born after self-focus entered the cultural mainstream, this generation has never known a world that put duty before self. Linda's youngest child, Jessica, was born in 1985. When Jessica was a toddler, Whitney Houston's No. 1 hit song declared that "The Greatest Love of All" was loving yourself. Jessica's elementary school teachers believed that their most important job was helping Jessica feel good about herself. Jessica scribbled in a coloring book called We Are All Special, got a sticker on her worksheet just for filling it out, and did a sixth-grade project called "All About Me." When she wondered how to act on her first date, her mother told her, "Just be yourself." Eventually, Jessica got her lower lip pierced and obtained a large tattoo on her lower back because, she said, she wanted to express herself. She dreams of being a model or a singer. She does not expect to marry until she is in her late twenties, and neither she nor her older sisters have any children yet. "You have to love yourself before you can love someone else," she says. This is a generation unapologetically focused on the individual, a true Generation Me.</p><p>If you're wondering what all of this means for the future, you are not alone. Reflecting on her role as a parent of this new generation, <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i> columnist Joan Ryan wrote: "We're told we will produce a generation of coddled, center-of-the-universe adults who will expect the world to be as delighted with them as we are. And even as we laugh at the knock-knock jokes and exclaim over the refrigerator drawings, we secretly fear the same thing."</p><p>Everyone belongs to a generation. Some people embrace it like a warm, familiar blanket, while others prefer not to be lumped in with their age mates. Yet like it or not, when you were born dictates the culture you will experience. This includes the highs and lows of pop culture, as well as world events, social trends, economic realities, behavioral norms, and ways of seeing the world. The society that molds you when you are young stays with you the rest of your life.</p><p>Today's young people are experiencing that society right now, and they speak the language of the self as their native tongue. The individual has always come first, and feeling good about yourself has always been a primary virtue. Generation Me's expectations are highly optimistic: they expect to go to college, to make lots of money, and perhaps even to be famous. Yet this generation enters a world in which college admissions are increasingly competitive, good jobs are hard to find and harder to keep, and basic necessities like housing and health care have skyrocketed in price. This is a time of soaring expectations and crushing realities. Joan Chiaramonte, head of the Roper Youth Report, says that for young people "the gap between what they have and what they want has never been greater." If you would like to start an argument, claim that young people today have it (a) easy, or (b) tough. Be forewarned: you might need referees before it's all over.</p><p>I have researched generational differences for thirteen years, since I was a twenty-one-year-old undergraduate working on my B.A. thesis. When I began, most of what had been written about generations was based on an amalgam of personal experience and educated guesses: it speculated about possible differences, but had little proof they actually existed. I read book after book that said things such as young people now are more likely to come from divorced homes, so they are more anxious and cynical (but were they really?). And, people born after 1982 entered a more child-centered society, so they would be more group-oriented (but was that really true?). It was all very interesting, but all very vague and nonscientific. I kept thinking, "Where's your proof? Has anyone ever found the real differences among the generations, instead of just guessing?"</p><p>The next year, I entered a Ph.D. program in personality psychology at the University of Michigan. I soon learned that academic psychologists measure personality traits and attitudes with carefully designed and validated questionnaires. Best of all, many of those questionnaires had been used thousands of times since they were first written in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, and most people who filled them out were college students and schoolchildren. That meant I could compare scores on these measures and see exactly how young people's personalities and attitudes had changed over the generations. To my surprise, no one had ever done this before.</p><p>This book presents, for the first time, the results of twelve studies on generational differences, based on data from 1.3 million young Americans. Many of the studies find that <i>when</i> you were born has more influence on your personality than the family who raised you. Or, in the words of a prescient Arab proverb, "Men resemble the times more than they resemble their fathers." When you finish this book, you'll be ready for an argument about which generation has it easy or tough and why -- you might even want to start it. At the very least, if you're part of Generation Me, you can use this book to bean that annoying guy who says that people your age are lazy and shiftless. Who says books can't be useful?</p><p>This book focuses on the current generation of young people, born in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, whom I call Generation Me. Right now in the 2000s, this group ranges from elementary school kids to thirty-something adults. Although thirty years is a longer-than-average span for a generation, it nicely captures the group of people who grew up in an era when focusing on yourself was not just tolerated but actively encouraged. A member of this generation myself, I was born in 1971. Like most of us who came along after the Baby Boom, I'm too young to remember Vietnam, Woodstock, or Watergate. During the summer of 1980, when every tree held a yellow ribbon for the Iran hostages, my main activity was running when I heard the chimes of the ice cream truck. Since I'm at the leading edge of this group, however, I'm also too old to have pierced anything except my ears or to have ever owned a Justin Timberlake poster. But when I talk about Generation Me, I'm also talking about myself.</p><p>Why the label Generation Me? Since GenMe'ers were born, we've been taught to put ourselves first. Unlike the Baby Boomers, GenMe didn't have to march in a protest or attend a group session to realize that our own needs and desires were paramount. Reliable birth control, legalized abortion, and a cultural shift toward parenthood as a choice made us the most <i>wanted</i> generation of children in American history. Television, movies, and school programs have told us we were special from toddlerhood to high school, and we believe it with a self-confidence that approaches boredom: why talk about it? It's just the way things are. This blas� attitude is very different from the Boomer focus on introspection and self-absorption: GenMe is not self-absorbed; we're self-important. We take it for granted that we're independent, special individuals, so we don't really need to think about it.</p><p>This is not the same as saying that young people are spoiled. That would imply that we always got what we wanted. Although some parents are indeed too indulgent, young people today must overcome many difficult challenges that their elders never had to face. While families could once achieve middle-class status on the earnings of one high school-educated person, it now takes two college-educated earners to achieve the same standard of living. Many teens feel that the world demands perfection in everything, and some are cracking under the pressure. Many people reaching their twenties find that their jobs do not provide the fulfillment and excitement they had anticipated, and that their salary isn't enough to afford even a small house. There's an acronym that describes how this growing self-reliance can be stressful: YO-YO (You're On Your Own).</p><p>I am also not saying that this generation is selfish. For one thing, youth volunteering has risen in the last decade. As long as time spent volunteering does not conflict with other goals, GenMe finds fulfillment in helping others. We want to make a difference. But we want to do it in our own way. GenMe also believes that people should follow their dreams and not be held back by societal expectations. Taking a job in a new city far from one's family, for example, isn't selfish, but it does put the individual first. The same is true for a girl who wants to join a boys' sports team or a college student who wants to become an actor when his parents want him to be a doctor. Not only are these actions and desires not c...</p></p><h2>Color Me Vegan: Maximize Your Nutrient Intake and Optimize Your Health by Eating Antioxidant-Rich, Fiber-Packed, Color-Intense Meals That Taste Great</h2><p><p>"With <i>Color Me Vegan</i>, Colleen Patrick-Goudreau takes veganism to a whole new level.

As the MWA Grandmaster explains in the Lawrence Block Bibliography: 1958�1993, "much of the work in question was bad, and categorically so... in the early sixties I wrote a soft core sex novel every month, designed to titillate but not to inflame, with a requisite sex scene in every chapter." Strip away the requisite sex scenes and one is left with a dark, clever crime story that shows Block's emerging strengths: good storytelling, a bright sense of humor and more than a few flashes of good writing. Ted Lindsay, a reporter for the Louisville Times, loses his wife to another man, then to a fatal accident. He relocates to New York in order to get a new start. He's unsuccessful until he sees "the girl." The girl turns Ted's life upside down, setting him on a path of treacherous lies, deceptions and dangers as they try to outwit the gang that's after her. The sex scenes, mild by today's more graphic standards, are more likely to amuse than titillate. Readers who have not yet discovered the joys of Block - bookseller/thief Bernie Rhodenbarr, PI Matthew Scudder, hitman John Keller, etc. - should skip this one. But established Block fans should enjoy this peek at the author's obscure apprentice work and be grateful that he moved on to create better books.<br>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.Ted Lindsay settles for a numbing routine while he heals from a painful marital breakup. Then he meets a woman who can make him forget his ex-wife, and life is once again filled with desire and passion. Cinderella Jones is on the run from a gang that pulled a casino scam to the tune of fifty large. While they were congratulating themselves, she ran off with the booty. She is willing to trade half the money and her body for Ted's help. They escape across the country, making frequent stops for passionate 1950s-style volcanic release sex. That's important because this is one of current best-selling author Block's early learn-the-trade, pay-the-bills sex novels. It predates his Matt Scudder and Bernie Rhodenbarr series, but readers will recognize the noir sensibility, the subtle humor, the surprisingly complex characters, and the relentless advancement of the plot. The release of this 40-year-old quickie is more of a curiosity than a publishing event, but it will attract considerable interest from Block's devoted readership. And, dated or not, it's still a pretty good crime caper. <i>Wes Lukowsky</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

This richly illustrated volume is the first to present all of these works--some seventy paintings that secured for Remington the critical acclaim he so coveted. Indeed, these magnificent nocturnes marked an important new direction for the celebrated illustrator, writer, and sculptor of America's vanishing frontier. </p><br><p> In these deeply personal works, Remington explored the technical and aesthetic difficulties of painting darkness. Surprisingly, his images are filled with color and light--moonlight, firelight, candlelight. Focused on the subject the artist had made his own--the American West--these paintings reflect Remington's dramatic reworking of the narrative tradition as well as the spare modernism of his late work.</p><br><br><p> <i>Frederic Remington: The Color of Night</i>, accompanying the first exhibition devoted to the nocturnes, includes three insightful essays discussing Remington's nocturnes within the literary, historical, aesthetic, and technological context of his time. The nocturnes do much more than document a night that was rapidly disappearing under bright, newly installed electric lights. They also reveal how this son of a Civil War hero moved from burnishing Theodore Roosevelt's rough riding heroics in Cuba to exploring, like Stephen Crane and Ernest Hemingway, his own soul-searing war experience, and, like Joseph Conrad, to probing America's own heart of darkness. </p><br><p> As the definitive resource on Remington's nocturnes, this volume pairs large reproductions of these stunning paintings--including newly conserved works and others not seen publicly since the artist's death--with commentary from his personal diaries and letters and from contemporary critics.</p><br><br><p> <b>EXHIBITION SCHEDULE</b></p><br><p>http://www.nga.gov/ National Gallery of Art, Washington </p><p>April 13 - July 13, 2003</p><br><p> http://www.gilcrease.org/ The Gilcrease Museum, Tulsa, Oklahoma</p><p>August 10 - November 9, 2003</p><br><p> http://www.denverartmuseum.org/ Denver Art Museum</p><p>December 13, 2003 - March 14, 2004</p></p><p><p>"This new and imaginative look at Remington's night pictures secures the artist's place in the history of American art, rather than exclusively in the history of western American art, and promises to attract a large audience from aficionados of the West to those interested in a cultural history of early-twentieth-century America. Remington's works are well known by most museum goers and beloved by a segment of an even wider public. Clearly written throughout, this book will put him literally in a new light for these and new audiences. By connecting Remington's pictorially and psychologically darkest pictures to Whistler's nocturnes; to Crane, Conrad, and Hemingway; and to the new technologies of electric light and flash photography, Anderson, Nemerov, and Sharpe bring Remington into the twentieth century and give him the place he deserves in a modern world."<b>--Carol Clark, Amherst College</b></p><b>Nancy Anderson</b> is Associate Curator of American and British Painting at the National Gallery of Art, where she has recently served as curator and principal catalogue author for the retrospective <i>Thomas Moran</i>. <b>Alexander Nemerov</b>, professor of art history at Yale University, is the author of <i>Frederic Remington and Turn-of-the-Century America</i>. <b>William C.

Young, vivacious, radiant, with all-American good looks and a lovely voice, she was America&#39;s &#39;singing sweetheart&#39; in the 1950s. Featured on the cover of Time, star of hit movies (White Christmas, Here Come the Girls), married to the brilliant actor Jose Ferrer in 1953 and mother of five children, host of her own network TV show in 1958, she had everything to live for. But in 1968 her world shattered. She suffered a terrifying mental breakdown, lived through the torments of hell, and emerged a strong, happy and fulfilled woman. This is her story. Never sparing herself, Rosemary Clooney writes with utter candor about the pressures that broke a gifted, beautiful and wildly successful young woman, bringing her to an isolation cell in the psychiatric ward of St. John&#39;s Hospital in Los Angeles. Hounded by hallucinatory demons, she pounded the walls in her paranoid frenzies. Reaching the depths of despair, Rosemary Clooney fought her way back to a productive, meaningful and contented life. Still beautiful, she has resumed her career and lives at peace with herself in her Beverly Hills home. Her house is alive with her children, four dogs, friends and music. &#39;My life is pretty darn good although it is not problemless,&#39; she writes. &#39;Conflicts still arise, but I can deal with them. Some people will read this and say that Rosemary Clooney has been through hell. They are right. I have. But without that hell, I would not know joy - and that is what I often feel today.&#39; And joy is the emotion she shares with every reader. Her story is one of the most gripping, heartrending - and ultimately inspiring - life stories you will ever read. And it has a most happy ending.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>Guts : The True Stories Behind Hatchet and the Brian Books</h2><p>Guess what -- Gary Paulsen was being kind to Brian. In <i>Guts</i>, Gary tells the real stories behind the Brian books, the stories of the adventures that inspired him to write Brian Robeson's story: working as an emergency volunteer; the death that inspired the pilot's death in <i>Hatchet</i>; plane crashes he has seen and near-misses of his own. He describes how he made his own bows and arrows, and takes readers on his first hunting trips, showing the wonder and solace of nature along with his hilarious mishaps and mistakes. He shares special memories, such as the night he attracted every mosquito in the county, or how he met the moose with a sense of humor, and the moose who made it personal. There's a handy chapter on "Eating Eyeballs and Guts or Starving: The Fine Art of Wilderness Nutrition." Recipes included. Readers may wonder how Gary Paulsen survived to write all of his books -- well, it took guts.</p><p>What do you do when you're being charged by a red-eyed furious wall of brown fur that is an insane moose? How do you make a weapon with your bare hands? How do you sneak up on a grouse or a rabbit, kill it with a well-aimed arrow, and cook it over a fire--without a pot? All this and lots more is essential learning for Brian Robeson, the young wilderness survivor in Gary Paulsen's classic novel <i>Hatchet</i>. In writing that book, Paulsen was determined that everything that happened to Brian--the survival techniques and the physical and emotional traumas--would be drawn closely from reality and his own experiences. In <i>Guts</i> he reveals the stories behind <i>Hatchet</i>, as he lived them. Linked to specific incidents from Brian's ordeal are the skills and insights Paulsen learned as a teenager passionately in love with hunting in the north woods of Minnesota, the extremes of exhaustion and cold he knew in running the Iditarod dog races in Alaska, the chilling close-up knowledge of heart attacks from his experiences as a volunteer ambulance driver, the silence and majesty of the wilderness. Some great stories are told here: the child killed by two kicks from the razor-sharp hooves of a small deer, the difficulties of sharing a rescue helicopter ride with a terrified dog team, and some spectacular gross-outs about the nutritional need to eat every part of an animal. <i>Hatchet</i> fans will be agog, and parents and teachers will be thrilled to see the enthusiastic reaction of even the most reluctant readers.

The journey begins as Bach puzzles over design modifications for his airplane, a Piper Cub. Perfect designs - simple and practical - seem to come to him from nowhere. But when a design appears one day, along with a fleeting glimpse of an intriguing woman, he sets out to discover the source of his visions. His search leads to a startling destination: a parallel universe, where a British airplane manufacturer, Saunders-Vixen Aircraft Company Ltd., solves problems for perplexed aviators.<br>There Bach meets Derek Hawthorne, his guide through Saunders-Vixen and the new world just unfolding. And there he meets a young aircraft designer named Laura Bristol.</p><p>Richard Bach, the writer who flew to success on the wings of <i>Jonathan Livingston Seagull</i>, once again returns to flight for metaphysical inspiration. Bach begins this journey with a quandary--how to customize his airplane, a small Piper Cub? For example, how can he keep his latch door from slamming shut in midflight? How to stop his oil cap from jiggling loose and disappearing? With each question the solutions appear; they are apparently delivered by a vision of a benevolent woman. Before long, Bach realizes that an aircraft designer from an earlier time and another dimension is tutoring him. Of course, Bach takes the ultimate flight into her parallel universe where he finds an old-fashioned aviation company that solves problems for troubled aviators. He also meets his mysterious muse Laura Bristol. <p>This is a brief story (101 pages) that wrestles with the limitations of present-day technology and the grandeur of the early days of aviation. True to Bach's mission, it also wrestles with the choices we make in this time and this moment, and how they can change our life and our universe. <i>--Gail Hudson</i></p>f eleven books, including such classic bestsellers as <b>Jonathan Livingston Seagull</b>, <b>Illusions</b>, and <b>One</b>, Richard Bach has earned a permanent place in the hearts of readers around the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;His visionary works have shown millions of readers the amazing possibilities of imagination, mind and spirit.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>An enthralling flight into the realm of possibility, <b>Out of My Mind</b> shows what happens when Richard Bach sets out to solve the design problems troubling his Piper Cub.&nbsp;&nbsp;He is taken on an unforgettable journey back to 1923 and the creative heyday of a British airplane manufacturer, Saunders-Vixen Aircraft Company, where problems are solved for confused aviators.&nbsp;&nbsp;There, Bach meets Derek Hawthorne, his guide through Saunders-Vixen, and a mysterious young aircraft designer named Laura Bristol who will provide the astonishing answers to his unspoken questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;This profoundly resonant tale remind</p><h2>The World-Ending Fire: The Essential Wendell Berry</h2><p><b><p>"Mr. Berry's sentences and stories deliver a great payload of edifying entertainment, which I hungrily consume, but it is the bass note of morality thumping through his musical phrases that guides me with the most constant of hands upon my plow." &#x2015;Nick Offerman, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>Paddle Your Own Canoe</i></p> <p>"Read [Berry] with pencil in hand, make notes, and hope that somehow our country and the world will soon come to see the truth that is told here." &#x2015;<i>The New York Times</i></p> <p>"He is unlike anybody else writing today." &#x2015;<i>New Statesman</i></p> <p>In a time when our relationship to the natural world is ruled by the violence and greed of unbridled consumerism, Wendell Berry speaks out in these prescient essays, drawn from his fifty-year campaign on behalf of American lands and communities</p> </b> <p>The writings gathered in <i>The World-Ending Fire</i> are the unique product of a life spent farming the fields of rural Kentucky with mules and horses, and of the rich, intimate knowledge of the land cultivated by this work.

It has no 'other side.' It is an arm of Kentucky's central upland known as The Bluegrass; one can think of it as a ridge reaching out from that center, progressively cut and divided, made ever narrower by the valleys of the creeks that drain it. The town of Port Royal in Henry County stands on one of the last heights of this upland, the valleys of two creeks, Gullion's Branch and Cane Run, opening on either side of it into the valley of the Kentucky River. My house backs against the hill's foot where it descends from the town to the river. The river, whose waters have carved the hill and so descended from it, lies within a hundred steps of my door.<br> <p>Within about four miles of Port Royal, on the upland and in the bottoms upriver, all my grandparents and great-grandparents lived and left such memories as their descendants have bothered to keep. Little enough has been remembered. The family's life here goes back to my mother's great-great-grandfather and to my father's great-grandfather, but of those earliest ones there are only a few vague word-of-mouth recollections. The only place antecedent to this place that has any immediacy to any of us is the town of Cashel in County Tipperary, Ireland, which one of my great-grandfathers left as a boy to spend the rest of his life in Port Royal. His name was James Mathews, and he was a shoemaker. So well did he fit his life into this place that he is remembered, even in the family, as having belonged here. The family's only real memories of Cashel are my own, coming from a short visit I made there five years ago.</p> <p>And so, such history as my family has is the history of its life here. All that any of us may know of ourselves is to be known in relation to this place. And since I did most of my growing up here, and have had most of my most meaningful experiences here, the place and the history, for me, have been inseparable, and there is a sense in which my own life is inseparable from the history and the place. It is a complex inheritance, and I have been both enriched and bewildered by it.</p> <p>I began my life as the old times and the last of the old-time people were dying out. The Depression and World War II delayed the mechanization of the farms here, and one of the first disciplines imposed on me was that of a teamster. Perhaps I first stood in the role of student before my father's father, who, halting a team in front of me, would demand to know which mule had the best head, which the best shoulder or rump, which was the lead mule, were they hitched right. And there came a time when I knew, and took a considerable pride in knowing. Having a boy's usual desire to play at what he sees men working at, I learned to harness and hitch and work a team. I felt distinguished by that, and took the same pride in it that other boys my age took in their knowledge of automobiles. I seem to have been born with an aptitude for a way of life that was doomed, although I did not understand that at the time. Free of any intuition of its doom, I delighted in it, and learned all I could about it.</p> <p>That knowledge, and the men who gave it to me, influenced me deeply. It entered my imagination, and gave its substance and tone to my mind. It fashioned in me possibilities and limits, desires and frustrations, that I do not expect to live to the end of. And it is strange to think how barely in the nick of time it came to me. If I had been born five years later I would have begun in a different world, and would no doubt have become a different man.</p> <p>Those five years made a critical difference in my life, and it is a historical difference. One of the results is that in my generation I am something of an anachronism. I am less a child of my time than the people of my age who grew up in the cities, or than the people who grew up here in my own place five years after I did. In my acceptance of twentieth-century realities there has had to be a certain deliberateness, whereas most of my contemporaries had them simply by being born to them.</p> <p>In my teens, when I was away at school, I could comfort myself by recalling in intricate detail the fields I had worked and played in, and hunted over, and ridden through on horseback &#x2013; and that were richly associated in my mind with people and with stories. I could recall even the casual locations of certain small rocks. I could recall the look of a hundred different kinds of daylight on all those places, the look of animals grazing over them, the postures and attitudes and movements of the men who worked in them, the quality of the grass and the crops that had grown on them. I had come to be aware of it as one is aware of one's body; it was present to me whether I thought of it or not.</p> <p>When I have thought of the welfare of the earth, the problems of its health and preservation, the care of its life, I have had this place before me, the part representing the whole more vividly and accurately, making clearer and more pressing demands, than any <i>idea</i> of the whole. When I have thought of kindness or cruelty, weariness or exuberance, devotion or betrayal, carelessness or care, doggedness or awkwardness or grace, I have had in my mind's eye the men and women of this place, their faces and gestures and movements.</p> <p>I have pondered a great deal over a conversation I took part in a number of years ago in one of the offices of New York University. I had lived away from Kentucky for several years &#x2013; in California, in Europe, in New York City. And now I had decided to go back and take a teaching job at the University of Kentucky, giving up the position I then held on the New York University faculty. That day I had been summoned by one of my superiors at the university, whose intention, I had already learned, was to persuade me to stay on in New York 'for my own good.'</p> <p>The decision to leave had cost me considerable difficulty and doubt and hard thought &#x2013; for hadn't I achieved what had become one of the almost traditional goals of American writers? I had reached the greatest city in the nation; I had a good job; I was meeting other writers and talking with them and learning from them; I had reason to hope that I might take a still larger part in the literary life of that place. On the other hand, I knew I had not escaped Kentucky, and had never really wanted to. I was still writing about it, and had recognized that I would probably need to write about it for the rest of my life. Kentucky was my fate &#x2013; not an altogether pleasant fate, though it had much that was pleasing in it, but one that I could not leave behind simply by going to another place, and that I therefore felt more and more obligated to meet directly and to understand. Perhaps even more important, I still had a deep love for the place I had been born in, and liked the idea of going back to be part of it again. And that, too, I felt obligated to try to understand. Why should I love one place so much more than any other? What could be the meaning or use of such love?</p> <p>The elder of the faculty began the conversation by alluding to Thomas Wolfe, who once taught at the same institution. 'Young man,' he said, 'don't you know you can't go home again?' And he went on to speak of the advantages, for a young writer, of living in New York among the writers and the editors and the publishers.</p> <p>The conversation that followed was a persistence of politeness in the face of impossibility. I knew as well as Wolfe that there is a -certain metaphorical sense in which you can't go home again &#x2013; that is, the past is lost to the extent that it cannot be lived in again. I knew perfectly well that I could not return home and be a child, or recover the secure pleasures of childhood. But I knew also that as the -sentence was spoken to me it bore a self-dramatizing sentimentality that was absurd. Home &#x2013; the place, the countryside &#x2013; was still there, still pretty much as I left it, and there was no reason I could not go back to it if I wanted to.</p> <p>As for the literary world, I had ventured some distance into that, and liked it well enough. I knew that because I was a writer the literary world would always have an importance for me and would always attract my interest. But I never doubted that the world was more important to me than the literary world; and the world would always be most fully and clearly present to me in the place I was fated by birth to know better than any other.</p> <p>And so I had already chosen according to the most intimate and necessary inclinations of my own life. But what keeps me thinking of that conversation is the feeling that it was a confrontation of two radically different minds, and that it was a confrontation with significant historical overtones.</p></p><h2>Obscene Bird of Night (Verba Mundi)</h2><p>This haunting jungle of a novel has been hailed as &#34;a masterpiece&#34; by Luis Bunuel and &#34;one of the great novels not only of Spanish America, but of our time&#34; by Carlos Fuentes.

At one point, he was the world&#x2019;s leading authority in mathematics, optics, and alchemy. And surprisingly he wrote more about faith and religion than on all of these subjects combined. But his single-minded focus on knowledge and discovery was a great detriment to his health. Newton suffered from fits of mania, insomnia, depression, a nervous breakdown, and even mercury poisoning.</p><p>Yet from all of his suffering came great gain. Newton saw the scientific world not as a way to refute theology, but as a way to explain it. He believed that all of creation was mandated and set in motion by God and that it was simply waiting to be &#x201c;discovered&#x201d; by man. Because of his diligence in both scientific and biblical study, Newton had a tremendous impact on religious thought that is still evident today.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p><p>Mitch Stokes is a Fellow of Philosophy at New St. Andrews College in Moscow, Idaho.

My family actually came from the walled city, often called Old Delhi, just to the south, built by the Moghul Emperor Shah Jahan in the seventeenth century. My family referred to it simply as Shahar, or the City.<br>There are many Delhis, as we were to study in school, all built either alongside each other or wholly or partly on top of each other, often reusing building materials knocked down in bloody efforts at domination. Our own original family home was in Chailpuri, in the narrow lanes of the Old City. It had as its carefully chosen foundation sturdy stones &#x201c;borrowed&#x201d; from the walls of Ferozshah Kotla, the fourteenth-century fortress and palace of a fourteenth- century emperor in a fourteenth-century Delhi.<br>Starting with the ancient Vedic city of Indraprastha, which flourished in the fifteenth century B.C., a succession of Delhis was built, first by generations of Hindu rajas, only to be followed in A.D. 1193 by a roll call of Muslim dynasties: Ghori, Ghaznavi, Qutubshahi, Khilji, Tughlak, Lodhi, and Moghul. They seemed to trust the dubious comfort of walled cities, and their leaders chose to name Delhi, again and again, after themselves. This ended, at least from the point of view of my childhood, with the British version, sans walls, New Delhi, designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens and built in the ruin- filled wilderness south of the Old City walls.<br>The Moghul capital, Shahjahanabad, or the Old City or the City, or Shahar, was where the written history of my family began. We were only blessed with our paternal side of it. My mother&#x2019;s side either kept few records or humbly kept its accomplishments under wraps. This written history, bound in red, was kept in my grandfather&#x2019;s home office.<br>When my grandfather&#x2014;Babaji, as we called him&#x2014;decided to move out of the City to the orchard estate, he was already a very successful barrister. His new house, the one in which I was born, was a brick- and-plaster version of a multi-roomed, grand Moghul tent with bits of British fortress and Greco-Roman classicism thrown in to hint vaguely at grandeur. The road it was built on was named after my grandfather, Raj Narain Road (with the patriotic Hindification of names that followed Independence, it is now Raj Narain Marg), and had the number 7 on its front gate. From the time I can remember, we always referred to that house as Number 7, as in &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to Number 7,&#x201d; or &#x201c;You know that big tamarind tree in Number 7. . . .&#x201d;<br>Not wishing to waste money, and full of the brio of someone recently &#x201c;England-returned&#x201d; (he had been studying law in London), he designed it all himself. As the family story goes, it was at this time that the British had decided to move their capital from Calcutta to Delhi, and Lutyens was in the process of building the new capital, to be named New Delhi. Lutyens asked my grandfather to pick any piece of land in New Delhi and build on it&#x2014;Lutyens might have designed the house himself had my grandfather asked&#x2014;but my grandfather dismissed the whole idea, saying, &#x201c;Who wants to live in that jungle?&#x201d; Properties in &#x201c;that jungle&#x201d; are now worth as much as those in central London and midtown Manhattan.<br>Years later, having proceeded beyond my three score and ten years, I was awarded an honorary CBE (Commander of the British Empire) by Queen Elizabeth II in Washington, D.C., another city designed by Lutyens, in a house also designed by Lutyens, the British ambassador&#x2019;s residence. As I stared at my reflection there in a pair of dark Lutyens mirrors, dotted with glass rosettes, I couldn&#x2019;t help thinking that my life might have come full-circle. I could have been born in a Lutyens house and received a grand recognition of my life in a Lutyens house. But I was not destined for such easy symmetry, for easy anything.<br>Babaji&#x2019;s whitewashed house consisted of a central &#x201c;gallery&#x201d;&#x2014;a hall, really&#x2014;leading to five very large rooms with fireplaces. One of these was the drawing room, and the others served as bedrooms, one to a family. Running along the front and back of the house were two long verandas lined with semi-classical, semi&#x2013;Greco-Roman pillars. The back, east-facing veranda looked out on the Yamuna River, or, as we called it with great familiarity, the Jumna River. It was here that so many of us, as infants, were rubbed with oil and left to absorb the morning sun. Because the land must have sloped down to the water, this veranda was one floor up, built over a very large, partially underground, damp, always cool cellar or <i>taikhana</i>. My grandfather used to make wine here from grapes he imported from Afghanistan, but that must have been before I was born.<br>The front, west veranda faced the gardens, which had incorporated the remnants of the old orchard and now included a winding drive to the front gate. The front and back verandas ended in rooms at each corner of the house, the front ones being shaped somewhat like turrets.

Historian Susan Mattern says yes, and <i>The Slow Moon Climbs</i> reveals just how wrong we have been. Taking readers from the rainforests of Paraguay to the streets of Tokyo, Mattern draws on historical, scientific, and cultural research to reveal how our perceptions of menopause developed from prehistory to today. For most of human history, people had no word for menopause and did not view it as a medical condition. Rather, in traditional foraging and agrarian societies, it was a transition to another important life stage. This book, then, introduces new ways of understanding life beyond fertility.</p><p>Mattern examines the fascinating "Grandmother Hypothesis"&#x2015;which argues for the importance of elders in the rearing of future generations&#x2015;as well as other evolutionary theories that have generated surprising insights about menopause and the place of older people in society. She looks at agricultural communities where households relied on postreproductive women for the family's survival. And she explores the emergence of menopause as a medical condition in the Western world. It was only around 1700 that people began to see menopause as a dangerous pathological disorder linked to upsetting symptoms that rendered women weak and vulnerable. Mattern argues that menopause was another syndrome, like hysterical suffocation or melancholia, that emerged or reemerged in early modern Europe in tandem with the rise of a professional medical class.</p><p><i>The Slow Moon Climbs</i> casts menopause, at last, in the positive light it deserves&#x2015;not only as an essential life stage, but also as a key factor in the history of human flourishing.</p></p><p>The first truly comprehensive history of Menopause covering how and why it evolved in humans, the role it has played in the developmen of civilization, and the different meanings it has taken on in different cultures and different times.<b>Susan P.

It's been yet another infuriating and boring summer with the despicable Dursleys, this time with minimal contact from our hero's non-Muggle friends from school. Harry is feeling especially edgy at the lack of news from the magic world, wondering when the freshly revived evil Lord Voldemort will strike. Returning to Hogwarts will be a relief... or will it?<p> The fifth book in J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series follows the darkest year yet for our young wizard, who finds himself knocked down a peg or three after the events of last year. Somehow, over the summer, gossip (usually traced back to the magic world's newspaper, the <i>Daily Prophet</i>) has turned Harry's tragic and heroic encounter with Voldemort at the Triwizard Tournament into an excuse to ridicule and discount the teen. Even Professor Dumbledore, headmaster of the school, has come under scrutiny by the Ministry of Magic, which refuses to officially acknowledge the terrifying truth that Voldemort is back. Enter a particularly loathsome new character: the toadlike and simpering ("<i>hem, hem</i>") Dolores Umbridge, senior undersecretary to the Minister of Magic, who takes over the vacant position of Defense Against Dark Arts teacher--and in no time manages to become the High Inquisitor of Hogwarts, as well. Life isn't getting any easier for Harry Potter. With an overwhelming course load as the fifth years prepare for their Ordinary Wizarding Levels examinations (O.W.Ls), devastating changes in the Gryffindor Quidditch team lineup, vivid dreams about long hallways and closed doors, and increasing pain in his lightning-shaped scar, Harry's resilience is sorely tested.</p><p> <i>Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix</i>, more than any of the four previous novels in the series, is a coming-of-age story. Harry faces the thorny transition into adulthood, when adult heroes are revealed to be fallible, and matters that seemed black-and-white suddenly come out in shades of gray. Gone is the wide-eyed innocent, the whiz kid of <i>Sorcerer's Stone</i>. Here we have an adolescent who's sometimes sullen, often confused (especially about girls), and always self-questioning. Confronting death again, as well as a startling prophecy, Harry ends his year at Hogwarts exhausted and pensive. Readers, on the other hand, will be energized as they enter yet again the long waiting period for the next title in the marvelous, magical series.

Expecting to assume ownership of Triumph Ranch, the couple instead learns that their deed is a fake, and that they must work for the rightful proprietors to earn their keep. Resourceful Elizabeth trades her trousseau&#x2014;including the fine quilts stitched by her Bergstrom relatives&#x2014;for the practical goods the Nelsons need to survive, and finds friendship with California native Rosa Diaz Barclay. When Elizabeth discovers a mysterious cache of quilts made by a member of the Diaz family that reveals a misplaced legacy of love, land, and ancestral ties, it becomes clear that only by stitching the rift between the past and the future can the inhabitants of Triumph Ranch hope to live in peace alongside history.</p><p>Jennifer Chiaverini is the author of the<i> New York Times </i>bestselling Elm Creek Quilts series, five collections of quilt projects, and several historical fiction novels.

She should have stayed in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, to help her brother run the hotel, even though business invariably slowed during the holiday week. Or she should have offered to help care for her sister's newborn twins. Even celebrating Christmas alone would have been preferable to returning to Elm Creek Manor. Her lifelong feelings of warmth and comfort toward the family home had suddenly given way to dread and foreboding. She would have to pass the week next door to Henry, knowing that he was near, and waiting in vain for him to come to her.</p><p>As Elm Creek Manor came into view, Elizabeth watched her father straighten in the driver's seat, his leather-gloved fingers flexing around the steering wheel of the new Model T Ford, an unaccustomed look of ease and contentment on his face. He never drank at Elm Creek Manor, nor in the days leading up to their visits, which made Elizabeth wonder why he could not abstain in Harrisburg as well. Apparently he craved his brothers' approval more than that of his wife and children, not that anyone but Elizabeth ever complained about his drinking.</p><p>"We're almost home," Elizabeth's father said. Her mother responded with an almost inaudible sniff. It irked her that after all these years, her husband still referred to Elm Creek Manor as home, rather than their stylish apartment in the hotel her father had turned over to their management upon their marriage. Second only to her father's flagship hotel, the Riverview Arms was smartly situated on the most fashionable street in Harrisburg, just blocks from the capitol building. It was a good living, much more reliable and lucrative than raising horses for Bergstrom Thoroughbreds. On his better days, George remembered that, but his insistence upon calling Elm Creek Manor home smacked of ingratitude.</p><p>But in this matter, if nothing else, Elizabeth understood her father. Of course Elm Creek Manor was home. The first Bergstroms in America had established the farm in 1857 and ever since, their family had run the farm and raised their prizewinning horses there, building on to the original farmhouse as the number of their descendants grew. They had lived, loved, argued, and celebrated within those gray stone walls for generations. But it was her father's fate to fall in love with a girl who loved the comforts of the city too much to abandon them for life on a horse farm. He could not have Millie and Elm Creek Manor both, so he accepted his future father-in-law's offer to sell his stake in Bergstrom Thoroughbreds and invest the profits in the Riverview Arms. Still, though he had sold his inheritance to his siblings, Elizabeth's father would always consider Elm Creek Manor the home of his heart.</p><p>And so would she, Elizabeth told herself firmly. Though Elm Creek Manor would never belong to her the way it would her cousins, every visit would be a homecoming for as long as she lived. She would not mourn for what was lost, whether an inheritance sold off before it could pass to her, or the love of a good man whose affection she had taken for granted.</p><p>Her father parked in the circular drive and took his wife's hand to help her from the car. Elizabeth climbed down from the backseat unassisted. A host of aunts, uncles, and cousins greeted them at the door at the top of the veranda. Uncle Fred embraced his younger brother while dear Aunt Eleanor kissed Elizabeth's mother on both cheeks. Aunt Eleanor's eyes sparkled with delight to have the family reunited again, but she was paler and thinner than she had been when Elizabeth last saw her, at the end of summer. Aunt Eleanor had heart trouble and had never in Elizabeth's memory been robust, but she was so spirited that one could almost forget her affliction. Elizabeth wondered if those who lived with her daily were oblivious to how she weakened by imperceptible degrees.</p><p>Suddenly Elizabeth's four-year-old cousin, Sylvia, darted through the crowd of taller relatives and took hold of Elizabeth's sleeve. "I thought you were never going to get here," she cried. "Come and play with me."</p><p>"Let me at least get though the doorway," said Elizabeth, laughing as Sylvia tugged off her coat. She had hoped to linger long enough to ask Aunt Eleanor -- casually, of course -- if she had any news of the Nelson family, but Sylvia seized her hand and led her across the marble foyer and up two flights of stairs to the nursery before Eleanor could even give her aunt and uncle a proper greeting.</p><p>Elizabeth would have to wait until supper to learn no one had seen Henry Nelson since the harvest dance in early November, except to wave to him from a distance as he worked in the fields with his brothers and father. Elizabeth feigned indifference, but her heart sank at the thought of Henry with some other girl on his arm -- someone pretty and cheerful who didn't spend half her time in a far-distant city writing teasing letters about all the fun she was having with other young men. It was probably too much to hope Henry had danced only with his sister.</p><p>By the next morning Elizabeth had persuaded herself that she didn't care how Henry might have carried on at some silly country dance. After all, since they had said good-bye at the end of the summer, she had attended many dances, shows, and clubs, always escorted by one handsome fellow or another. Her mother worried that she was running with a fast crowd, but her father, who should have known better since his own hotel had a nightclub, assumed Elizabeth and her friends passed the time together as his own generation had -- in carefully supervised, sedate activities where young men and women congregated on opposite sides of the room unless prompted by a chaperone to interact. Elizabeth's mother had a more vivid imagination, and it was she who waited up for her youngest daughter with the lights on until she was safely tucked into bed on Friday and Saturday nights.</p><p>Every summer, Elizabeth surprised her mother by willingly abandoning the delights of the city for Elm Creek Manor. Millie, oblivious to the appeal of the solace and serenity of the farm, always expected Elizabeth to put up more of an argument. Elizabeth certainly did about everything else. She wanted to bob her hair and wear dresses with hemlines up to her knee. She plastered her bedroom walls with magazine photographs of Paris, London, Venice, and other places she was highly unlikely to visit, covering up the perfectly lovely floral wallpaper selected by Millie's mother when the hotel was built. She chatted easily with young men, guests of the hotel, before they had been properly introduced. Millie shook her head in despair over her daughter's seeming indifference to how things looked, to what people thought. Why should anyone believe she was a well-brought-up girl if she didn't behave like one?</p><p>Yet every year as spring turned to summer, Elizabeth found herself longing for the cool breeze off the Four Brothers Mountains, the scent of apple blossoms in the orchard, the grace and speed of the horses, the awkward beauty of the colts, the warmth and affection of her aunts and uncles and grandparents. She felt at ease at Elm Creek Manor. Her meddling mother was far away. She was in no danger of walking into a room to find her father passed out over a ledger, an empty brandy bottle on the desk. There was only comfort and acceptance and peace. And Henry.</p><p>Once he had only been Henry Nelson from the next farm over, a boy more her brother's friend than her own. All the children played together, Bergstroms and Nelsons, meeting at the flat rock beneath the willow next to Elm Creek after chores were done, and running wild in the forests until they were called home for supper. They met again after evening chores and stayed out well after dark, playing hide-and-seek and Ghost in the Graveyard. One hot August night on the eve of her return to the city, Elizabeth, her brother Lawrence, Henry, and Henry's brother climbed to the top of a haystack and lay on their backs watching the night sky for shooting stars. One by one the other children crept off home to bed, but Elizabeth felt compelled to stay until she had counted one hundred shooting stars. Secretly, she had convinced herself that if she could stay awake long enough to count one hundred stars, her parents would decide that they could stay another day.</p><p>She had only reached fifty-one when Lawrence sat up and brushed hay from his hair. "We should go in."</p><p>"If you want to go in, go ahead. I'll come when I'm ready."</p><p>"I'm not letting you walk back alone in the dark. You'll probably trip over a rock and fall in the creek."</p><p>The darkness hid Elizabeth's scarlet flush of shame and anger. Lawrence never made any effort to disguise his certainty that his youngest sister would fail at everything she tried. "I will not. I know the way as well as you."</p><p>"I'll walk back with her," said Henry.</p><p>Lawrence agreed, glad to be rid of the burden, then he slid down from the haystack and disappeared into the night.</p><p>Elizabeth counted shooting stars in indignant silence.</p><p>"Thank you," she said, after a while. She lay back and gazed up at the starry heavens, hay prickling beneath her, warm and sweet from the sun. After a time, Henry's hand touched hers, and closed around it. Warmth bloomed inside her, and she knew suddenly that after this summer, everything would be different. Henry had chosen her over her brother. Henry was hers.</p><p>She was fourteen.</p><p>After that, whenever Henry came to Elm Creek Manor, Elizabeth knew she was the person he had come to see. They began exchanging letters during the months they were separated, letters in which each confided more about their hopes and fears than either would have been able to say aloud. Whenever they reunited after a long absence, Elizabeth always experienced a fleeting moment of shyness, wondering if she should have told him abo...</p></p><h2>Artificial You: AI and the Future of Your Mind</h2><p><p><b>A sober-minded philosophical exploration of what AI can and cannot achieve</b></p><p>Humans may not be Earth&#x2019;s most intelligent beings for much longer: the world champions of chess, Go, and <i>Jeopardy!</i> are now all AIs. Given the rapid pace of progress in AI, many predict that it could advance to human-level intelligence within the next several decades. From there, it could quickly outpace human intelligence. What do these developments mean for the future of the mind?</p><p>In <i>Artificial You</i>, Susan Schneider says that it is inevitable that AI will take intelligence in new directions, but urges that it is up to us to carve out a sensible path forward. As AI technology turns inward, reshaping the brain, as well as outward, potentially creating machine minds, it is crucial to beware. Homo sapiens, as mind designers, will be playing with "tools" they do not understand how to use: the self, the mind, and consciousness. Schneider argues that an insufficient grasp of the nature of these entities could undermine the use of AI and brain enhancement technology, bringing about the demise or suffering of conscious beings. To flourish, we must grasp the philosophical issues lying beneath the algorithms.</p><p>At the heart of her exploration is a sober-minded discussion of what AI can truly achieve: Can robots really be conscious? Can we merge with AI, as tech leaders like Elon Musk and Ray Kurzweil suggest? Is the mind just a program? Examining these thorny issues, Schneider proposes ways we can test for machine consciousness, questions whether consciousness is an unavoidable byproduct of sophisticated intelligence, and considers the overall dangers of creating machine minds.</p></p><p>This book explores the philosophical implications of the developing technological advances in artificial intelligence that are likely to change our conceptions of the mind, self, and consciousness.<b>Susan Schneider</b> is the NASA/Baruch Blumberg Chair at the Library of Congress and the director of the AI, Mind and Society Group at the University of Connecticut.

Even the text, highly readable and informative, is a little rose-tinted in places, but perhaps the authors can hardly be blamed when the gentlemanly cruelties of the old regime look so innocent next to the quintessentially totalitarian 20th-century hell that replaced them. (Nowhere was the true nature of the new "people's" dispensation revealed more vividly than in the lurid, incompetent savagery with which Nicholas II and his family were dispatched, a story reconstructed in considerable detail here.) In any case, despite a touch of sentimentality, this is a fine short history of how the Romanov dynasty ended, artfully disguised as a coffee-table book. If you merely flip through the pictures (Ekaterinburg, Tsarkoe Selo, the Cathedral of Peter and Paul at St. Petersburg, shining like a gold dagger in the snow), you will ache to travel to Russia. If you read the text, you will learn a surprising amount about the world of an almost comically ineffectual man with whom the Fates amused themselves by placing him at a key turning point in modern history. Heartless autocrat that he was, you may even end up feeling sorry for him: the cure was so much worse than the disease. <i>--Richard Farr</i>Peter Kurth has written for VANITY FAIR, THE NEW YORKER etc. ISADORA has taken him 10 years to write.</p><h2>Vermeer&#39;s Hat: The Seventeenth Century and the Dawn of the Global World</h2><p><p><b>In the hands of an award-winning historian, Vermeer's dazzling paintings become windows that reveal how daily life and thought&#x2015;from Delft to Beijing&#x2015;were transformed in the seventeenth century, when the world first became global.</b> <br>A painting shows a military officer in a Dutch sitting room, talking to a laughing girl. In another, a woman at a window weighs pieces of silver. Vermeer's images captivate us with their beauty and mystery: What stories lie behind these stunningly rendered moments? As Timothy Brook shows us, these pictures, which seem so intimate, actually offer a remarkable view of a rapidly expanding world. The officer's dashing hat is made of beaver fur, which European explorers got from Native Americans in exchange for weapons. Those beaver pelts, in turn, financed the voyages of sailors seeking new routes to China. There&#x2015;with silver mined in Peru&#x2015;Europeans would purchase, by the thousands, the porcelains so often shown in Dutch paintings of this time. Moving outward from Vermeer's studio, Brook traces the web of trade that was spreading across the globe. <br>The wharves of Holland, wrote a French visitor, were "an inventory of the possible." <i>Vermeer's Hat</i> shows just how rich this inventory was, and how the urge to acquire the goods of distant lands was refashioning the world more powerfully than we have yet understood.</p></p><p><p><b>Timothy Brook </b>completed this book while a John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation Fellow.

An insightful read for historians and art historians alike and a fine guide into the rewards of studying material culture.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Library Journal</i></p><p>&#x201c;Brook utilizes the props in Vermeer's tableaux as starting points to journey into the cultural and economic world of the time: A teacup pours forth the history of the porcelain trade with China, while a felt hat is traced to beaver trapping in North America. It's a fascinating approach to cultural history, providing new ways of thinking about the origins of commonplace objects.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Entertainment Weekly, A grade, EW Pick</i></p><p>&#x201c;Marvelous....The tidbits are fascinating in their own right, but Brook has a larger point, relevant to our own time: We need to narrate the past in a way that recognizes connections, not just divisions.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Bookpage</i></p><p>&#x201c;...effective and illuminating....A magic-carpet conducted by a genial, learned host.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i></p><p>&#x201c;Brook...accomplishes his task...with authority and economy.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Booklist</i></p><p>&#x201c;Vermeer's Hat is a deftly eclectic book, in which Timothy Brook uses details drawn from the great painter's work as a series of entry points to the widest circles of world trade and cultural exchange in the seventeenth century. From the epicenter of Delft, Brook takes his readers on a journey that encompasses Chinese porcelain and beaver pelts, global temperatures and firearms, shipwrecked sailors and their companions, silver mines and Manila galleons. It is a book full of surprising pleasures.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Jonathan Spence, author of The Death of Woman Wang, In Search of Modern China and The Memory Palace of Matteo Ricci</i></p><p>&#x201c;[<i>Vermeer's Hat</i>] is an absolutely wonderful idea, beautifully executed (and I wish I'd thought of it). In Timothy Brook's hands, Vermeer's paintings really do become windows on the past, illuminating a fascinating period in which the world was being remade by global trade.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Tom Standage, author of A History of the World in Six Glasses</i></p><p>&#x201c;Thanks to Brook's roving and insatiably curious gaze, Vermeer's small scenes widen onto the broad panorama of world history: everything from shipwrecks and massacres to global weather patterns and the history of tobacco. The result is like one of Vermeer's trademark reflective pearls that magically reveals a world beyond itself. A more entertaining guide to world history - and to Vermeer - is difficult to imagine.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Ross King, author of The Judgment of Paris, Michelangelo and the Pope's Ceiling and Brunelleschi's Dome</i></p><p>&#x201c;For those who think they have mastered all the ins and outs of the seventeenth century Netherlands and particularly the country portrayed by the marvelously stay-at-home Dutch painters, Timothy Brook's fine book provides a shock. By way of Vermeer's pictures, he takes us through doorways into a suddenly wider universe, in which tobacco, slaves, spices, beaver pelts, China bowls, and South American silver are wrenching together hitherto well-insulated peoples. We hear behind the willow-pattern calm the crash of waves and cannon. A common humanity with a shared history comes about, with handshakes and treaties, shipwrecks and massacres, as trade expands and the world shrinks.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Anthony Bailey, author of Vermeer: A View of Delft</i></p></p><h2>Stiff News</h2><p>When an old woman dies of apparently natural causes, a letter received by her son leads Detective Inspector C.

R.E.K. � AudioFile 2001, Portland, Maine-- <i>Copyright � AudioFile, Portland, Maine</i>Strange things are happening at the Almstone Nursing Home for retired military officers and their wives in the town of February, the turf of Detective Inspector C.D. Sloan, his Superintendent Leeyes, and his Detective Constable Crosby (After Effects, 1996, etc.). Aged and ailing Gertrude Powell has died at the Home, but shes left behind a letter to her son Lionel claiming to have been a murder victim. It seems, too, that correspondence is missing from her room, but Medical Examiner Dabbe's autopsy fails to produce anything suspicious. Meanwhile, Sloan's persistent questioning at the Home reveals a surprising number of deathsmore than even this setting would warrant; a common war background in North Africa among the male patients; something called an Escape Committee, and something else named the Almstone Pragmatic Sanction, a title evoking euthanasia. A Scottish dagger, an Egyptian amulet and the disappearance of new patient Morag McBeath make for further complications, but finally (as Sloan eventually discovers) what holds the key to Almstones troubles are a few long-hidden secrets. What might have been an intriguing story gets buried in a stream of clichd quotes, tedious asides, and a meandering, unfocused narration that produces little suspense and a pancake-flat finale. Disappointing stuff from a usually reliable veteran. -- <i>Copyright �1998, Kirkus Associates, LP.

In <i>The New York Times Book Review, </i>Sam Tanenhaus proclaimed it "a masterpiece of American fiction" and lauded its illumination, "through the steady radiance of its author's profound moral intelligence, [of] the world we thought we knew." </p><p>In <i>Farther Away</i>, which gathers together essays and speeches written mostly in the past five years, Franzen returns with renewed vigor to the themes, both human and literary, that have long preoccupied him.

Good morning, relatives and faculty. It&#x2019;s a great honor and pleasure to be here today.<br>I&#x2019;m going to go ahead and assume that you all knew what you were getting into when you chose a literary writer to deliver this address. I&#x2019;m going to do what literary writers do, which is to talk about themselves, in the hope that my experience has some resonance with your own. I&#x2019;d like to work my way around to the subject of love and its relation to my life and to the strange technocapitalist world that you guys are inheriting.<br>A couple of weeks ago, I replaced my three-year-old BlackBerry Pearl with a much more powerful BlackBerry Bold, with a five-megapixel camera and 3G capability. Needless to say, I was impressed with how far the technology had advanced in three years. Even when I didn&#x2019;t have anybody to call or text or e-mail, I wanted to keep fondling my new Bold and experiencing the marvelous clarity of its screen, the silky action of its tiny track pad, the shocking speed of its responses, the beguiling elegance of its graphics. I was, in short, infatuated with my new device. I&#x2019;d been similarly infatuated with my old device, of course; but over the years the bloom had faded from our relationship. I&#x2019;d developed trust issues with my Pearl, accountability issues, compatibility issues, and even, toward the end, some doubts about my Pearl&#x2019;s very sanity, until I&#x2019;d finally had to admit to myself that I&#x2019;d outgrown the relationship.<br>Do I need to point out that&#x2014;absent some wild, anthropomorphizing projection in which my old BlackBerry felt sad about the waning of my love for it&#x2014;our relationship was entirely one-sided? Let me point it out anyway. Let me further point out how ubiquitously the word <i>sexy</i> is used to describe late-model gadgets; and how the extremely cool things that we can do now with these gadgets&#x2014;like impelling them to action by speaking incantations, or doing that spreading-the-fingers iPhone thing that makes images get bigger&#x2014;would have looked, to people a hundred years ago, like a magician&#x2019;s incantations, a magician&#x2019;s hand gestures; and how, when we want to describe an erotic relationship that&#x2019;s working perfectly, we speak, indeed, of <i>magic</i>. Let me toss out the idea that, according to the logic of technoconsumerism, in which markets discover and respond to what consumers most want, our technology has become extremely adept at creating products that correspond to our fantasy ideal of an erotic relationship, in which the beloved object asks for nothing and gives everything, instantly, and makes us feel all-powerful, and doesn&#x2019;t throw terrible scenes when it&#x2019;s replaced by an even sexier object and is consigned to a drawer: that (to speak more generally) the ultimate goal of technology, the <i>telos</i> of <i>techne</i>, is to replace a natural world that&#x2019;s indifferent to our wishes&#x2014;a world of hurricanes and hardships and breakable hearts; a world of <i>resistance</i>&#x2014;with a world so responsive to our wishes as to be, effectively, a mere extension of the self. Let me suggest, finally, that the world of technoconsumerism is therefore troubled by real love, and that it has no choice but to trouble love in turn.<br>Its first line of defense is to commodify its enemy. You can all supply your own favorite, most nauseating examples of the commodification of love. Mine include the wedding industry, TV ads that feature cute young children or the giving of automobiles as Christmas presents, and the particularly grotesque equation of diamond jewelry with everlasting devotion. The message, in each case, is that if you love somebody you should buy stuff.<br>A related phenomenon is the ongoing transformation, courtesy of Facebook, of the verb <i>to like</i> from a state of mind to an action that you perform with your computer mouse: from a feeling to an assertion of consumer choice. And liking, in general, is commercial culture&#x2019;s substitute for loving. The striking thing about all consumer products&#x2014;and none more so than electronic devices and applications&#x2014;is that they&#x2019;re designed to be immensely likable. This is, in fact, the <i>definition</i> of a consumer product, in contrast to the product that is simply itself and whose makers aren&#x2019;t fixated on your liking it. I&#x2019;m thinking here of jet engines, laboratory equipment, serious art and literature.<br>But if you consider this in human terms, and you imagine a person defined by a desperation to be liked, what do you see? You see a person without integrity, without a center. In more pathological cases, you see a narcissist&#x2014;a person who can&#x2019;t tolerate the tarnishing of his or her self-image that not being liked represents, and who therefore either withdraws from human contact or goes to extreme, integrity-sacrificing lengths to be likable.<br>If you dedicate your existence to being likable, however, and if you adopt whatever cool persona is necessary to make it happen, it suggests that you&#x2019;ve despaired of being loved for who you really are. And if you succeed in manipulating other people into liking you, it will be hard not to feel, at some level, contempt for those people, because they&#x2019;ve fallen for your shtick. Those people exist to make you feel good about yourself, but how good can your feeling be when it&#x2019;s provided by people you don&#x2019;t respect? You may find yourself becoming depressed, or alcoholic, or, if you&#x2019;re Donald Trump, running for president (and then quitting).<br>Consumer-technology products, of course, would never do anything this unattractive, because they&#x2019;re not people. They are, however, great allies and enablers of narcissism. Alongside their built-in eagerness to be liked is a built-in eagerness to reflect well on us. Our lives look a lot more interesting when they&#x2019;re filtered through the sexy Facebook interface. We star in our own movies, we photograph ourselves incessantly, we click the mouse and a machine confirms our sense of mastery. And, since our technology is really just an extension of ourselves, we don&#x2019;t have to have contempt for its manipulability, the way we might with actual people. It&#x2019;s all one big endless loop. We like the mirror and the mirror likes us. To friend a person is merely to include the person in our private hall of flattering mirrors.<br>I may be overstating the case, a little bit. Very probably, you&#x2019;re sick to death of hearing social media dissed by cranky fifty-one-year-olds. My aim here is mainly to set up a contrast between the narcissistic tendencies of technology and the problem of actual love. My friend Alice Sebold likes to talk about &#x201c;getting down in the pit and loving somebody.&#x201d; She has in mind the dirt that love inevitably splatters on the mirror of our self-regard. The simple fact of the matter is that trying to be perfectly likable is incompatible with loving relationships. Sooner or later, for example, you&#x2019;re going to find yourself in a hideous, screaming fight, and you&#x2019;ll hear coming out of your mouth things that you yourself don&#x2019;t like at all, things that shatter your self-image as a fair, kind, cool, attractive, in-control, funny, <i>likable</i> person. Something realer than likability has come out in you, and suddenly you&#x2019;re having an actual life. Suddenly there&#x2019;s a real choice to be made, not a fake consumer choice between a BlackBerry and an iPhone, but a question: Do I love this person? And, for the other person: Does this person love me? There is no such thing as a person whose real self you like every particle of. This is why a world of liking is ultimately a lie. But there <i>is</i> such a thing as a person whose real self you love every particle of. And this is why love is such an existential threat to the technoconsumerist order: it exposes the lie.<br>One of the heartening things about the plague of cell phones in my Manhattan neighborhood is that, among all the texting zombies and the party-planning yakkers on the sidewalks, I sometimes get to walk alongside somebody who&#x2019;s having an honest-to-God fight with a person they love. I&#x2019;m sure they&#x2019;d prefer not to be having the fight on a public sidewalk, but here it&#x2019;s happening to them anyway, and they&#x2019;re behaving in a very, very uncool way. Shouting, accusing, pleading, abusing. This is the kind of thing that gives me hope for the world.<br>Which is not to say that love is only about fighting, or that radically self-involved people aren&#x2019;t capable of accusing and abusing. What love is really about is a bottomless empathy, born out of the heart&#x2019;s revelation that another person is every bit as real as you are. And this is why love, as I understand it, is always specific. Trying to love all of humanity may be a worthy endeavor, but, in a funny way, it keeps the focus on the self, on the self&#x2019;s own moral or spiritual well-being. Whereas, to love a specific person, and to identify with their struggles and joys as if they were your own, you have to surrender some of your self.<br>When I was a senior in college, I took the first seminar the college had ever offered in literary theory, and I fell in love with the most brilliant student in that seminar. Both of us liked how instantly powerful literary theory made us feel&#x2014;it&#x2019;s similar to modern consumer technology in this regard&#x2014;and we flattered ourselves on how much more sophisticated we were than the kids who were still doing those tedious old close-textual readings. For various theoretical reasons, we also thought it would be cool to get married. My mother, who had spent twenty years making me into a person who craved full-commitment love, now turned around and advocated that I spend my twenties, as she put it, &#x201c;footloose and fancy-free.&#x201d; Naturally, since I thought she was wrong about everything, I assumed she was wrong about t...</p><h2>The Time Quartet (A Wrinkle in Time, A Wind in the Door, A Swiftly Tilting Planet, Many Waters)</h2><p>Content: A Wrinkle in Time; A Wind in the Door; A Swiftly Tilting Planet; and Many Water.

My brother Duncan had turned on every light in the house to welcome us, and each window beamed the message into the fog as he emerged from the front door to give me a bone-crushing bear hug. He was more gentle with Mum. We had been delayed for an extra day in Leicester with the lawyers, as some last-minute paperwork failed to arrive in time and had to be sent up the M1 on a motorbike. Duncan had masterminded the movement of all Mum&#x2019;s furniture from Surrey in three vans, with eight men who had another job to go to the next day. The delay had meant a fraught standoff in the entryway to the park, with the previous owner&#x2019;s lawyer eventually conceding that Duncan could unload the vans, but only into two rooms (one of them the fetid front kitchen) until the paperwork was completed. <br><br>So the three of us picked our way in wonderment between teetering towers of boxes and into the flagstoned kitchen, which was relatively uncluttered and, we thought, could make a good center of operations. A huge old trestle table I had been hoarding in my parents&#x2019; garage for twenty years finally came into its own, and was erected in a room suited to its size. It&#x2019;s still there as our dining-room table, but on this first night its symbolic value was immense. Some boxes and carpets Duncan had managed to store in the back pantry had just been flooded, so while he unblocked the drain outside I drove to a Chinese takeout I&#x2019;d spotted on the way from Route A38, and we sat down to our first meal together in our new home. Our spirits were slightly shaky but elated, and we laughed a lot in this cold, dark, chaotic house on that first night, and took inordinate comfort from the fact that at least we lived near a good Chinese place. <br><br>That night, with Mum safely in bed, Duncan and I stepped out into the misty park to try to get a grip on what we&#x2019;d done. Everywhere the flashlight shone, eyes of different sizes blinked back at us, and without a clear idea of the layout of the park at this stage, the mystery of exactly what animals lurked behind them added greatly to the atmosphere. We knew where the tigers were, however, and made our way over to one of the enclosures that had been earmarked for replacement posts to get a close look at what sort of deterioration we were up against. With no tigers in sight, we climbed over the stand-off barrier and began peering by flashlight at the base of the structural wooden posts holding up the chain-link fence. We squatted down and became engrossed, prodding and scraping at the surface layers of rotted wood to find the harder core, in this instance reassuringly near the surface. We decided it wasn&#x2019;t so bad, but as we stood up were startled to see that all three tigers in the enclosure were now only a couple of feet away from where we were standing, ready to spring, staring intently at us. Like we were dinner. <br><br>It was fantastic. All three beasts &#x2014; and they were such glorious beasts &#x2014; had maneuvered to within pawing distance of us without either of us noticing. Each animal was bigger than both of us put together, yet they&#x2019;d moved silently. If this had been the jungle or, more accurately in this case, the Siberian tundra, the first thing we'd have known about it would have been a large mouth around our necks. Tigers have special sensors along the front of their two-inch canines that can detect the pulse in your aorta. The first bite is to grab, then they take your pulse with their teeth, reposition them, and sink them in. <br><br>As they held us in their icy glares, we were impressed. Eventually, one of these vast, muscular cats &#x2014; acknowledging that due to circumstances beyond their control (i.e., the fence between us), this had been a mere dress rehearsal &#x2014; yawned, flashed those curved dagger canines, and looked away. We remained impressed. <br><br>We started back toward the house. The wolves began their eery night chorus, accompanied by the sounds of owls &#x2014; there were about fifteen on site &#x2014; the odd screech of an eagle, and the nocturnal danger call of the vervet monkeys as we walked past their cage. This was what it was all about, we felt. All we had to do now was work out what to do next.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>Silence: A Christian History</h2><p><b>A provocative history of the role of silence in Christianity by the award-winning, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author</b><br><br>In this essential work of religious history, the <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author of <i>Christianity</i> explores the vital role of silence in the Christian story.<br><br>How should one speak to God?

The dog who guarded the stable of the racehorse Silver Blaze did not bark, because &#x2018;[o]bviously the midnight visitor was someone whom the dog knew well&#x2019;; it was in fact the racehorse&#x2019;s trainer, intent on villainy.[1] I am also fond of another dog, probably a deliberate <i>hommage </i>to Holmes, created by G. K. Chesterton in his Father Brown story &#x2018;The Oracle of the Dog&#x2019;. The supposed oracle in question was the anguished howl of a dog who had swum out to sea to retrieve a walking stick, apparently at the exact time that the murder had taken place. Father Brown cheerily debunked the illusion that the dog had supernatural knowledge: the dog howled because it was cheated of its natural presuppositions about the walking stick. The object was in reality a sword stick, the murder weapon, and so it had sunk beneath the waves and could not be retrieved as a dog would expect of a stick. And the illusion that the howl coincided with the time of death was in fact a human contrivance.</p><p>The two tales come to the same conclusion. Conan Doyle reminds us that often one of the most significant scraps of evidence to illuminate a particular historical question is what is <i>not </i>actually done or said. Chesterton&#x2019;s premise might seem the reverse of Holmes&#x2019;s, since what is important is what the dog did, not what it did not do, but it is really the same: as he spells it out, &#x2018;A dog is a devil of a ritualist. He is as particular about the precise routine of a game as a child about the precise repetition of a fairy-tale.&#x2019;[2] Chesterton&#x2019;s insight is as much about human anthropology as canine psychology. Like dogs, we are patternmaking animals. The historian&#x2019;s main task is to dig down to find these patterns, to reconstruct the crystalline structures in the actions and the pronouncements of people and to explain their meaning, as far as fragile and pattern-making human beings are capable of doing so. Only when we know the patterns well can we point out what is missing; what should be there, but is not.</p><p>Silence, then, is a vital part of what is missing in history, a necessary tool to help us make sense of the written and visual evidence that we possess. The novelist Margaret Atwood has observed that &#x2018;two and two doesn&#x2019;t necessarily get you the truth. Two and two equals a voice outside the window . . . The living bird is not its labelled bones.&#x2019; Silence is a major part of that flesh in which the bones of positive historical evidence need clothing.[3] An example of a silence which has always fascinated me, from my first historical specialization in the sixteenth century, is the almost total absence of the Christian name Mark in late medieval and Tudor England, when the names of two of his fellow-Evangelists are common, and another, John, is overwhelmingly present. The one obvious exception which proves the rule, Anne Boleyn&#x2019;s unfortunate musician Mark Smeaton, might explain later Tudor silence by discrediting the name because he was executed for treasonous adultery with the queen, but does not account for what went before. This is one silence, apparently trivial, yet surely significant, for which so far I have found no good explanation. If we were to solve it, we might learn something new about the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.</p><p>The dogs of Holmes and Father Brown also tell us why history is such a subversive discipline, and why all its enquiries have a potentially transforming effect on the present: comfortable expectations are disrupted when we realize that the dog is not an oracle, but just a dog. Chesterton drew a breezily theistic moral from his story, which appears to be one of the main sources of the commonly repeated but apocryphal remark attributed to him that when people stop believing in God, they don&#x2019;t believe in nothing, they believe in anything. His version in &#x2018;The Oracle of the Dog&#x2019; was, &#x2018;It&#x2019;s the first effect of not believing in God that you lose your common sense and can&#x2019;t see things as they are.&#x2019;[4] Whether or not we find Chesterton&#x2019;s homespun Thomism congenial, the method of Holmes and Father Brown is that of the critical historian, which naturally includes the historian of religion. It embodies a call to refocus, to see things as they are. Both the dog&#x2019;s silence in the night-time, and the dog&#x2019;s howl of bewilderment, are the clues which we really need.</p><p>There is a very considerable literature now on silence in religion; what might make this book different? I approach the subject out of a life spent in teaching and researching history, but also spent in fruitful encounters with Christian Churches and Christian lives. Religious patterns are among the most traceable and universally occurring in the fabric of human societies, and they have been at the centre of my life&#x2019;s business. All through my historical career, I have been keenly aware of the importance of silence in human affairs, for a good biographical reason: from an early age, I was conscious of being gay, and that proved to be a great blessing for a young historian. In the Britain of half a century ago, gay teenagers were keenly aware of what could not be said; of when to be silent and of how to convey messages in other ways. In much of the rest of the world, depressingly, those skills are still necessary. I was lucky to be able to face up to this challenge early on, was able to live life as I wished, and have enjoyed life much more as a result, but this life-experience has left me alert to the ambiguities and multiple meanings of texts, and to the ambiguities and multiple meanings in the behaviour of people around me. I have become attuned to listening to silence and to finding within it the keys to understanding many situations, far beyond anything to do with sexuality. Particularly in the still half-hidden</p><p>structures of gay sociability, there are all sorts of means of disclosure and concealment, ways of encoding meaning and subverting the mainstream assumptions of society. As a gay child and teenager, I also effortlessly developed the historian&#x2019;s other essential quality, a sense of distance: an observer status in the rituals constructed for a heterosexual society in a world which in reality was not quite like that. I did not need the jargon of post-modernism to teach me elementary survival strategies in this world of mirrors, just what Chesterton would have called common sense.</p><p>It will be apparent that the first sort of silence I encountered in my life was primarily an absence, exactly the sort of absence with which Doyle and Chesterton dealt: that of humans failing to make public or explicit the full range of patterns around which they were thinking and leading their lives. I shall be considering such absences of noise in the later part of this book, and also what happens when silence ends;</p><p>the recent history of sexuality has been one of the most dramatic examples of such phenomena. Inflexible pattern-makers get very angry when their patterns are under threat, or when others offer new patterns, or when it is pointed out that there are parts of the pattern missing; that is why so much conservative religion in the modern world seems so deeply and perpetually cross.</p><p>My own first experience thus predisposed me to deal with silence in religion primarily as evasion and wilful avoidance of truths. Yet experience has also taught me to recognize and enjoy the much more pleasing and edifying truth that silence may be positive as well as negative. Even at the most mundane level of human life, there are white lies, and there are things not said because it is kinder not to say them. But there is much more than that, and the book begins with different and arguably much more positive silences. The Christian faith is based on the assertion that there is more to an understanding of silence than simply the interaction of humans with humans, or even of the interaction of humans with societies or landscapes around them. Whether or not one accepts the assumptions of theism (belief in a God), it belittles and impoverishes human experience not to treat seriously the Christian assertion of divinity, and it is the duty of any historian of religion to explore the working out of faith in the past with appropriate sympathy and understanding. Some will see that silences lie at the centre of religious experience, and will wish to affirm that they have had a profound and unfolding effect on the history of Christianity.</p><p>As I explore those silences which may be more than mere absence, I am painfully aware that a Gifford Lecturer more than a hundred years ago, William James, magisterially pre-empted me in this, in delivering the first version of one of his most important and influential books, <i>Varieties of Religious Experience</i>.[5] It has been daunting, first in the Gifford Lectures and now in this book, to follow in the wake of a writer who bequeathed us one of the foundational attempts to describe the nature of mysticism. Parts One to Three of this book nevertheless trace the theme through nearly three millennia of monotheism up to the beginning of the eighteenth century, as silence dances through the history not merely of Christianity, but of the religious ideas that fed into its first flourishing in the life and death of Jesus.</p><p>For silences are by no means the exclusive property of the Christian faith. Judaism, one of Christianity&#x2019;s two matrices, began a lively conversation about silence. Some silences were imported into Judaism and Christian belief from elsewhere &#x2013; a very great deal from the Greek culture which provides Christianity&#x2019;s other main parent, or perhaps from even further afield. Some may still be in the course of discovery. All these varied discussions of silence may have a problematic relationship to the discourse from which the Christian faith is constructed, in which one foundation strand, based on the Gospel of John, gives Jesus the Christ the name &#x2018;Word&#x2019;, or rather calls him by the Greek word which means so much more than simply &#x2018;word&#x2019;. <i>Logos </i>is the whole act of speech, or the structured thought behind the speech, and from there its meanings spill outwards into conversation, narrative, musing, meaning, reason, report, rumour, even pretence.</p><p>How does silence relate to the Christ who is <i>Logos</i>? The series of Gifford Lectures from which this book sprang was of course an incarnation of that problem. No doubt many of those at my lectures savoured the incongruity of their lecturer talking for six hours about silence, but I thought that the Principal and University might feel that their money had been ill-spent if I simply stood there mute for the allotted time and collected my fee and travel-expenses. It is hardly a new problem: we have been arguing vociferously about how to talk about silence, from the first efforts of Christian theologians in the second century to create a distinctively Christian &#x2018;negative theology&#x2019;, through to Theodor Adorno&#x2019;s critique of Ludwig Wittgenstein&#x2019;s famous remark about what to do with that about which we cannot speak.[6]One of the aims of this book is to explore this &#x2018;negative theology&#x2019;. It is a technical term of art for theologians, whose connotations are far from negative, unlike the pejorative sense of that word now commonly used in everyday conversation. Instead, &#x2018;negative theology&#x2019; promises a fruitful road into divinity, based on a tradition stretching all the way back to Greek philosophy and some of the strands within the Hebrew Scriptures. We shall be meeting that tradition a great deal.</p><p>What follows can only be a sketch, or the starting of a number of hares. And it is in the nature of the starting of hares that the hares are thereby in grave danger of death. Any critical historian of Christianity is in the same peril. Arnaldo Momigliano (1908&#x2013;87), a great historian of antiquity, who as one of his admiring students observed &#x2018;refused to distinguish between scholarship and life&#x2019;, commented with a mixture of ruefulness and zest about the specially combative nature of expounding the history of religion: &#x2018;Other historians can be satisfied with simply retelling the past. The chances that they will be challenged are few. The historian of the Church knows that at any point he will be challenged. The questions with which he deals are controversial. And the controversy is never one of pure dogma or of pure fact &#x2013; the two are interrelated.&#x2019;[7]</p><p>As my probing progresses, critics will observe that it becomes biased towards the history of the Western Church of the Latin Rite and its successors in Protestantism and post-Reformation Roman Catholicism. There is rich material in that history, but I am acutely aware that it is a distorted sample of Christian experience, and that more might be said about Orthodox Christianity as well as the non-Chalcedonian Churches which for several centuries seemed to be the future in Christian development. Previously I have done my best, both on the printed page and on camera, to introduce a perspective on the Christian past which gives a proper place to these Eastern stories. So I feel rueful about my omissions now, but I can do no more than point out the problem before someone else does. In particular, one distortion of a more balanced Christian history (particularly a history of Christian silence) is provided by the accident that the Western Latin Christian tradition has been in a position of worldly power for more of its history than any other branch of Christianity. Those who have a particular reverence for the Church in communion with the Holy See will no doubt feel that I have been unduly hard on it. If they do, my regrets are not very fulsome. As we know from many walks of life, the powerful often have a lot to hide, and they strive to regulate the right to silence.</p><p>Power is often sustained by distortions of truth or reality, particularly when power takes the form of claiming a monopoly on truth. It is hardly surprising, then, that Christianity&#x2019;s most lasting and powerful monarchy, the papacy, has gathered to itself more silences of shame and distortion of the truth than other sources of authority in the Christian tradition. Yet Protestants should not be complacent; in their days of power, they have had a good deal to answer for as well. The ending of many of Christianity&#x2019;s less than admirable silences is the result of the Western Churches&#x2019; loss of inappropriate worldly power, as the long Constantinian era appears to have come to its end. The powerful are likewise inclined to monopolize noise: so, for instance, Churches in positions of power have announced their dominant presence by the ringing of bells, and when Churches have been deprived of power, as by the Ottomans or the Bolsheviks, the bells have been silenced.[8] We have had to strain very hard to listen to some of the voices of the powerless throughout the Christian story; and among the histories of the powerless, I number the last thousand years of non-Chalcedonian Christian history, about which, alas, I go on to say little. From the stories of power, Christianity may learn a lesson. Strident proclamation has many dangers, and silence has its own eloquence.

James Durham propped his elbows on the balcony, laced his hands together, and stared down into his foyer. It had been a bit dramatic, he supposed, a bit too <i>Grecian</i>, paving the foyer with flagstones. At the time, he'd considered it the epitome of pure aesthetics. Now it nauseated him. Too much white: a funeral shroud of a foyer. Silent but for the buzzing of the lights, like vultures in the distance. He felt dizzy. His mouth was dry. It would be so easy to trip over this rail. One careless movement, a sweet swan's dive downward, and the floor would not be so white anymore. </p><p> His breath left him in a shudder. He stepped back, and his head seemed to soar from his shoulders. Good God. He was never trying another of Phin's little concoctions. </p><p> Hmm. That resolution felt...familiar. As if he'd made it before. Several times, in fact. How hopeless he was. He laughed softly. Yes, how predictably, tediously hopeless. </p><p> "Sanburne!" </p><p> The word came spearing through his consciousness, scattering the fog. With a start, he realized it had never been silent. Music, laughter, high-pitched squeals were spilling down the stairs. Yes -- <i>that</i> was right! He had twenty-odd guests above; there'd been a party afoot since last evening, and he was the host. "Bloody hell," he said, and the astonishment in his voice sounded so queer and overdone that he had to laugh again. </p><p> <i>"Sanburne!"</i> It sounded very close now, this shrill cry, which might or might not belong to Elizabeth; he could never be sure without looking, not in this state. <i>Then look up, you idiot.</i> Yes, excellent idea. In one moment, he would. </p><p> "Sanburne, have you gone <i>deaf</i>?" </p><p> With an effort he raised his head. It was indeed Lizzie; she appeared to be floating down the staircase. Magic? But no; if there were any magic in the world, it would not reside in Elizabeth, no matter how she might need it. Poor, luckless darling. He walked toward her with sympathetic intentions, intending to take her hands, for she looked distraught, her once-rakish coiffure now slipping over a tear-filled eye. </p><p> But walking proved beyond him. He tripped over the first stair and sat down. The impact astonished him. What <i>had</i> he been thinking, not to carpet the place? </p><p> He shook his head and reached for the banister. Before he could pull himself up, Lizzie was at his side, her skirts -- stained by something; wine, smelled like -- bunching around her calves. "Sanburne, he -- he's got a w-w-woman -- " She sobbed a breath that brought her d�colletage into his nose. A bit of caviar had gotten lodged in her neckline. He brushed it away. Most mysterious. What the hell were they doing up there? </p><p> "He's got a woman on his lap! One of your maids! Fondling her right in front of me!" Elizabeth's fingers fastened onto his upper arm, digging for attention. "Do you <i>hear</i> me? Are you awake?" </p><p> He was curious about that, too. "Are my eyes open?" </p><p> She made a noise of exasperation, then took his chin in her grip, yanking it up so their eyes met. "They are open," she said. "Behold: it is I." </p><p> "It is you," he agreed. "Your eyes are particularly lovely when you've been crying, my dear. So green. So much lovelier than white." </p><p> The corners of her mouth began to tremble. "Nello's got one of the maids," she said. </p><p> Something...insistent there. He did not like her look, suddenly, but he could not break from it. It made the world around him take on weight. Stairs, his house, a party. For one last second, the giddiness remained. And then his mind clicked, gears grinding. "One of the <i>maids</i>, did you say?" He pulled himself up by way of a baluster. The first step was the hardest. Damn Nello for a tosser; he always made a scene. </p><p> "Wait!" Elizabeth came scrambling up behind him. "James, you won't...<i>hurt</i> him, will you? He's just a bit drunk, is all. Or whatever it is that Ashmore gave him. I didn't mean to start a fight!" </p><p> "Of course you bloody did." He said it without rancor as he mounted the staircase. The drug was still coursing within him; he felt incapable of dividing his attention. Nello! Chap knew the rules. One couldn't break host's rules. Deuced poor taste! </p><p> He crested the stairs to discover the party had spilled out of the salon. Elise Strathern was weaving her way down the corridor, Christian Tilney nipping at her heels. Colin Muir, scoundrel Scot, was trying to feed liquor to the stone bust of one of James's forebears, while his audience -- the Cholomondley twins, who else? -- giggled appreciatively. </p><p> Inside the yellow room, things were no more civilized. Glass crunched beneath his feet and the air held a stinking miasma of opium and cigar smoke. Someone had broken the palm fronds that screened the musicians from the gathering, and damn if the violinist did not have a cummerbund tied around his head as he manfully sawed out the latest music hall ditty. The flutist had given up, and was watching with avid amazement as Mrs. Sawyer turned a jig atop the banquet table -- beneath which the cellist, and his instrument, were sleeping in a pool of punch. </p><p> And there was Nello, arguing in the far corner with Dalton. Elizabeth was right (but she was always attentive to detail in this one regard: namely, the idiotic regard she felt for Nello). He'd lodged one of the parlormaids beneath his arm, and she was thin-lipped, squirming. James picked his way through the debris and came up just as Nello lifted his fist for the first punch. </p><p> James caught him by the wrist. "Now, now, children." </p><p> "Damn his eyes, Sanburne! I'll have at him! A cheating swot, am I?" </p><p> "Just about," said Dalton, grinning drunkenly. "Why, you swived that Egyptian wench so hard that Sanburne just about puked to death from the boat rocking." </p><p> "You little -- " </p><p> James wrapped his forearm around Nello's neck and hauled backward. The parlormaid shrieked and fell to her bum, from which position, James ascertained with a glance, she crawled toward safer quarters. "As for that," he said into Nello's ear, "you <i>are</i> a cheat, and if you don't believe me, Lizzie will set you straight." </p><p> Nello abruptly ceased struggling. "Lizzie...?" </p><p> "Indeed," Elizabeth said, coming round to confront him. "You pig!" </p><p> James loosened his hold. "Just full of snap, ain't she?" </p><p> Indeed, her face was pinched with rage. She stepped forward, her hands raised over her head -- and in them, James spotted something he'd been meant to deliver this morning. <i>His Egyptian funerary stela!</i> </p><p> "Lizzie, no!" </p><p> The rock slab smashed down on Nello's shoulder. The awful cracking sound caused even the violinist to falter. With a cry of agony, Nello dropped to his knees. "My shoulder!" </p><p> "Broken it," Dalton predicted, and slid down the wall to nap. </p><p> "Dear God!" James pried the stela from Elizabeth's fingers. He turned it over, searching anxiously for damage. He'd been coddling the thing for days, toasting it with evening brandy, gloating over the bitter envy his father was sure to feel at the sight of it. And Lizzie used it to <i>bludgeon</i> someone! </p><p> "Have I broken it?" she asked. She was looking down at Nello, a curiously blank expression on her face. </p><p> "No," he decided, on a long breath of relief. "It looks intact." </p><p> "His shoulder, you buffoon, not your precious rock." </p><p> "My precious -- ? <i>Priorities,</i> Elizabeth!" </p><p> She snorted. "Oh, stuff. My priorities do not include your foolish antics with your father." </p><p> James grinned. His father, indeed. Moreland would be at the lecture by now, blissfully ignorant of what was in store for him. There was no way he'd be able to resist this piece. "Lizzie, love, your priorities have nothing to do with me. Now look here," he said more briskly, "be a dear and send round for the doctor. Also, tell Gudge he may set up Nello in the blue bedroom." Nello moaned again, and James bent to eye him. "Perhaps with a very large bucket," he added. Old boy was looking rather green. </p><p> "Don't go," Nello managed. "I need...help." </p><p> Lizzie was more shrill. "You're <i>leaving me</i>? With Nello nearly <i>dead</i>?" </p><p> With a reassuring pat to the stela, James rose. "Never. Friendship is eternal, etcetera. But I have an appointment at the Archaeological Institute, you might recall." A month in Egypt, spent suffering seasickness off the edge of a houseboat that -- Dalton was correct -- rocked like a pendulum. Countless letters to and from Port Said. A fortune spent on various, ultimately second-rate antiques. Thousands of pounds to finally secure the right one. Six months of work leading to this moment, and he'd almost forgotten! Phineas certainly had a way with the toxins. </p><p> "Oh, of course," Lizzie said, "the <i>Archaeological Institute</i>. If Nello were dead, I doubt you should miss your appointment!" </p><p> For Nello? "You might be right." He gave Lizzie a quick kiss on the cheek, then picked his way out of the salon, eager to depart before she started crying again. <br> </p><p> Lydia had managed to keep her voice from shaking. Nor had anyone yet stood to decry her as a lunatic. Sophie was falling asleep -- her hat tipped, abruptly righted when Antonia poked her, then began tipping again -- but that was not unusual. Most importantly, Lord Ayresbury, in the front row, was listening with every sign of interest. All in all, she thought cautiously, it was going very...well. </p><p> The hope she'd been repressing for days swelled and burst free. It washed through her at such dizzying speed that she actually stuttered from the impact. "If -- ah, if my father's findings are correct, then this strongly suggests..." </p><p> A door slammed open at the back of the hall, admitting a much-rumpled gentleman. The sight startled her into a pause. It was coming on noon, and he was wearing evening attire, black tailcoat and bow tie. </p><p> Some of the audience turned to mark his advance. He was trailed by a footman in garish crimson livery, who cradled a greatcoat in one arm, and some sort of slab in the other...</p></p><h2>Face-�-Face: Conversation et Reda&#x301;ction</h2><p>Binding solid.

Blackmun (1908-1999) wrote numerous landmark Supreme Court decisions, including Roe v. Wade, and participated in the most contentious debates of his era-all behind closed doors. In<i> Becoming Justice Blackmun</i>, Linda Greenhouse of <i>The New York Times</i> draws back the curtain on America's most private branch of government and reveals the backstage story of the Supreme Court through the eyes and writings of this extraordinary justice.<br><br>Greenhouse was the first print reporter to have access to Blackmun's extensive archive and his private and public papers. From this trove she has crafted a compelling narrative of Blackmun's years on the Court, showing how he never lost sight of the human beings behind the legal cases and how he was not afraid to question his own views on such controversial issues as abortion, the death penalty, and sex discrimination. Greenhouse also tells the story of how Blackmun's lifelong friendship with Chief Justice Warren E. Burger withered in the crucible of life on the nation's highest court, revealing how political differences became personal, even for the country's most respected jurists.<br><br><i>Becoming Justice Blackmun</i>, written by America's preeminent Supreme Court reporter, offers a rare and wonderfully vivid portrait of the nation's highest court, including insights into many of the current justices. It is a must-read for everyone who cares about the Court and its impact on our lives.<br></p><p>Linda Greenhouse has covered the Supreme Court for <i>The New York Times</i> since 1978 and won a Pulitzer Prize in 1998 for her coverage of the Court.

She graduated from Radcliffe College and holds a master of studies in law from Yale Law School.<br><br>From <i>Becoming Justice Blackmun</i>:<br> Planned Parenthood v. Casey was argued on April 22, 1992. As in the Webster case three years earlier, it was not clear from the discussion at the conference whether Roe v. Wade itself was really on the table. But while there was uncertainty as to the details, Blackmun knew he would be writing a dissent. <br> Rehnquist circulated a twenty-seven-page draft majority opinion on May 27. "Wow! Pretty extreme!" Blackmun wrote in the margin of the first page. All the Pennsylvania law's provisions were upheld. Further, Rehnquist said the Court had been "mistaken in Roe when it classified a woman's decision to terminate her pregnancy as a 'fundamental right.' " <br> Then, suddenly, everything changed. Two days later, a handwritten note arrived from Anthony Kennedy. "Dear Harry, I need to see you as soon as you have a few free moments. I want to tell you about some developments in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, and at least part of what I say should come as welcome news."<br> When the two met the following day, Kennedy revealed that he, O'Connor, and Souter had been meeting privately and were jointly drafting an opinion that, far from overruling Roe, would save it-not in its details, but in its essence. The constitutional right to abortion would be preserved.<br></p><h2>Until We Meet Again</h2><p>A true story of love and survival in the holocaust.</p><p></p><h2>Catwings Return</h2><p>Wishing to visit their mother, two winged cats leave their new country home to return to the city, where they discover a winged kitten in a building about to be demolished.</p><p>Ursula Le Guin writes both poetry and prose, and in various modes including children&#39;s books, YA books, fantasy, science fiction and fiction.

Three of Le Guin&#39;s titles have been finalists for The American Book Award and the Pulitzer Prize, and among the many honors her writing has received are a National Book Award, five Hugo Awards, five Nebula Awards, and The Margaret A. Edwards Award. She lives in Oregon.Grade 2-4-- James and Harriet, the youngest and most adventurous of four winged cats, return from the country refuge that they found in Catwings (Orchard, 1988) to the inner-city slum where they were born, to see their mother again. They find a frightened winged kitten before finding their mother, the genteel Mrs. Jane Tabby. She is delighted to see her grown children and grateful that they've brought back her lost kitten. She insists that they take the kitten to safety in the country. This may grate on those who criticized as unfeeling Mrs. Jane's decision, in the first book, to send her older children off to a new life so that she could begin a new liaison unfettered, but it seems in character. Although characterization is slight, there is enough to win readers' sympathy. This gently appealing story will mean more to those who enjoyed the more vigorous first book, but it is hard to resist a story that brings a terrified, lonely kitten home to a loving family. The illustrations are engaging pen-and-ink drawings with watercolor wash. A handsome little book for middle readers. --Marilyn Iarusso, New York Public Library<br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Candlemas: Feast of Flames (Holiday Series)</h2><p><p>Beyond the darkness of winter, there is an oasis of light and warmth on the journey from solstice to spring.

Today we call it Candlemas, Imbolg, or by other names. Once this part of the year was called the Wolf-month, or Dead-month. For many of our ancestors, snow covered the sleeping earth, the nights were still long, and the gaiety of the solstice holidays had long since faded. Food supplies were beginning to look scanty and moldy, and the promise of spring seemed far away. And yet&#x2015;they celebrated. In the cold darkness, they found reason for hope: a gust of wind less chill, a few minutes more of gray daylight, a solitary crocus pushing through the snow. They created a holy day, a festival, a feast; and under many different names it is with us today. <br>The festival has been called Imbolg and Oimelc, the Feast Day of Saint Brigid, Candlemas, L� Fh�ile Br�d, and by names spoken in the mists of prehistory, but lost today. There is an overlapping complex of holy days in Europe, clustered around the first to the third of February; and several other related festivals later in the month. We will explore several of these special events, beginning with the days when humanity&#x2019;s hold on survival seemed tenuous at best. <br>The Ice Ages and <br>the End of Winter <br>If winter is an inconvenience for some people now, it was a serious challenge to our medieval ancestors. And to our still more distant ancestors, it was a gamble with death every single year. <br>Imagine the Paleolithic era&#x2015;the Old Stone Age. Imagine not from our perspective, as a dim prequel to civilization with its abundant food, central heating, and vast transportation networks. Imagine being there, and there is . . . all there is. <br>Winter, on the vast steppes of Asia. For a thousand miles in any direction there is nothing to break the force of the frigid wind. Gray skies, glaciers far to the north, grass brown and sere where the endless breeze has stripped away the snow. There are seventeen in your clan, since your grandmother left the group. She was forty-one, an ancient crone, and could no longer keep up with the migration. Now the clan follows the tracks of a herd of musk oxen, hoping for food. <br>That night you camp in the lee of a low mound, and the people chew on the last dried strips of mammoth meat from a kill made weeks ago. The hunters ranging ahead have not caught sight of the musk oxen, and their tracks may be erased by morning. The wind howls like the spirits of the lonely dead, and there is a current of fear and hopelessness among the living. More than one clansman expects to join his ancestors soon. <br>The shaman stands. She is a little young for her position, but was the closest thing to an apprentice old Nev had, before he died last fall of the coughing sickness. She speaks: &#x201c;The Moon has passed through Her cycle once and more, since we marked the Longest Night. You all know this. But the nights still seem long, and food is scarce. You wonder if the winter will ever end, if warmth will ever return to the land. Now I say this: I have measured the length of the nights, as Nev taught me, and they are shorter. The daylight grows. This is the message of the Great Mother, Her promise that spring will come! She sends another message; I have dreamed it. Within two days we shall find the herd, and as much meat as we can carry. So pass around what is left of the mammoth meat; eat what you wish, for more is coming. Trust the Mother!&#x201d; <br>She speaks with authority for one of fourteen summers. The people believe, and soon the last of the food is shared out among the clan, and they dance around the hot, leaping flames of the bone-fire they have built. <br>The Bear Goddess of <br>Neolithic Europe <br>One of the oldest forms of the Goddess is that of the bear, and one of the earliest recorded holy days of February honors Her in that form, perhaps because the awakening of hibernating animals is one sure sign of spring&#x2019;s approach. According to Marija Gimbutas, a scholar of Old European deities, &#x201c;The concept of the goddess in bear shape was deeply ingrained in mythical thought through the millennia and survives in contemporary Crete as &#x201c;Virgin Mary of the Bear.&#x201d; In the cave of Acrotiri near ancient Kydonia, a festival in honour of Panagia (Mary) Arkoudiotissa (&#x2018;she of the bear&#x2019;) is celebrated on the second day of February.&#x201d;1 <br>The bear was apparently a central figure in the Paleolithic religions of Old Europe and Asia. The hundreds of bear-headed clay figurines found at archaeological sites in Eastern Europe seem to represent the primal mother-goddess; some are seated on thrones and decorated with lunar crescents. Female bears are known for their fierce devotion to their young, and so the bear was a symbol of motherhood.2 As the bear protects her cubs, so the bear-goddess protects the tribes by bringing spring with her emergence from winter&#x2019;s sleep. <br>Bears are also connected with water; bear-shaped vases of early European cultures are covered with zigzags, chevrons, and striated diamonds, all patterns symbolic of flowing water. The themes of water and fire appear again and again in connection with end-of winter celebrations; fire for warmth against the cold, water thawing from ice and snow as spring returns. <br>The Eleusinian Mysteries <br>of Greece <br>Let us move ahead thousands of years to another spring festival, in which the goddess has divided into a more human Mother and Her returning Daughter. In ancient Greece, the lesser Eleusinian Mysteries were celebrated at the end of January and beginning of February. This festival commemorated the return of Persephone from the Underworld to Her mother Demeter. Demeter, as you may recall, was a Mother Goddess Who brought life to the world, and made the crops grow and the bees give honey. When Her daughter Persephone was stolen away (or eloped, in some versions of the story) to the Land of the Dead with the god Hades, Demeter mourned, life slipped from the land, and the first winter came. <br>A compromise arranged by the gods allowed Persephone to reign as Queen of the Underworld for half of each year, and return to the world of the living for half. When She returns, bringing the spring, the goddess Hekate and the spirits of the dead chosen for rebirth accompany Her. <br>The Greeks held a great celebration to mark the occasion. First there was a torchlight procession, in which the participants combed the land and even waded into the sea, recreating the search for Demeter&#x2019;s lost daughter. When word came that Persephone was found, the assemblage cheered and held a great feast to celebrate. <br>Lupercalia <br>The Romans regarded February as a time of cleansing and purification&#x2015;Februarius mensis, &#x201c;the month of ritual purification.&#x201d; However, fertility and love were also popular themes. Several festivals were celebrated, but their biggest event was the Lupercalia on February 15. This holiday was named for the Lupercal, the grotto where the infants Romulus and Remus came ashore after floating down the Tiber River in a basket. There they were suckled and raised by a wolf, and later grew up to found the city and nation of Rome. Why was the sacred bear of ancient Europe largely replaced by the wolf in classical Rome? Edain McCoy believes that &#x201c;Lupercalia celebrated the beginning of the wolves&#x2019; mating season. . . . Wolves mate for life and their union was seen not only as a sign of spring, but of the eternal union of the Goddess and her Sun God.&#x201d;3 <br>In part, the festival of Lupercalia honored Faunus (also called Lupercus), a goat-footed god of Nature, flocks, crops and gardens, music, animals, and much more. Goats were sacrificed to him, and then his priests took to the streets wearing goatskin loincloths. They were known as the Luperci (the priests, not their loincloths.) Each carried goatskin thongs and their role was to hit everyone they saw; presumably this token scourging was a symbolic ritual purification. <br>Married women received a bonus effect, however; the thongs supposedly encouraged fertility. Technically, the Luperci were supposed to strike them gently across the palms, but apparently some women were so serious about the fertility issue that they stripped naked to encourage the Luperci to go further. <br>The younger people celebrated by putting the names of willing girls into a jar; the boys would draw names and discover who were to be their partners for the festivities. This custom spread and was still popular in England and Scotland hundreds of years later. <br>Pope Gelasius I, who reigned over the Roman Church from 492&#x2013;6 c.e., &#x201c;banned this cheerfully scandalous festival and met with such an outcry that he had to apologize.&#x201d;4 In 496 the feast of Lupercalia was changed to the feast of Saint Valentine, and instead of girls&#x2019; names, the names of various saints were put into a box for people to draw out. Prayers would be offered to the saint you drew.5 We can only guess how wildly popular this change was with young people. Oddly enough, the custom seems to have evaporated over the years. <br>The Roman Church was finally able to officially abolish Lupercalia, although its replacement was never quite as respectable as the Church fathers might have hoped. <br>The Lupercalia was definitely the social event of the season; however, the Greeks and Romans were not stingy with their festivals. A citizen who didn&#x2019;t have to work for a living could spend the entire month preparing for holy days, celebrating them, or recovering from them. Here is a sampling of the Roman and Greek holidays for the month: <br>January 31 to February 2: Februalia dedicated to Vesta, &#x201c;The Shining One,&#x201d; goddess of fire and the hearth. <br>February 2: The day honoring Juno Februata as the virgin mother of Mars. <br>February 6: Festival of Aphrodite, Greek goddess of love, beauty, creation, vegetation and flowers; known to the Romans as Venus. <br>February 7 to 9: Feast of the Old Greek, Roman and Slavic goddess Artemis/Diana/Diwitsa, as creatrix, midwife of birthing creatures of all kinds, protector of the young, and punisher of child abusers. <br>February 12: Festival of Diana as protectress of wildlife; she was also a Triple Goddess of the Moon, Virgin, Mother, and Huntress. <br>February 14: Feast of Juno, Queen of the Heavens, consort of Jupiter, Great Mother, goddess of Earth and the moon, protectress of women. <br>February 15: She&#x2019;s back! Festival of Love for Aphrodite. <br>February 16: Celebration of Victoria, goddess of victory. <br>February 26: Day of Hygeia, goddess of health and healing. <br>February 27: Day of Selene, the Mother aspect of the moon goddess, patroness of magick, intuition, fecundity, and the tides of the ocean. <br>Each of these deities had other major festivals as well; these are simply their holy days that happened to be in February. <br>The Celts and Imbolg <br>Further north, the Celtic peoples marked the season in their own way. Imagine yourself in an ancient Irish village: the solstice is past, the days are dreary, the memory of warmth seems like a fading dream, and the promise of spring is scarcely to be seen. It is then, &#x201c;Late in January, as the Wolf Moon wanes or the Chaste Moon waxes to full, we begin to prepare for the Imbolc Sabbat.&#x201d;6 <br>Many of the Celtic peoples were pastoral herders, making their living from their flocks of sheep. Naturally enough, their seasonal festivals reflected their livelihood. One of the major Celtic festivals was Imbolg (or Imbolc), pronounced &#x201c;em-bowl/g&#x201d; or &#x201c;immol&#x2019;g,&#x201d; (with a tiny hesitation or unstressed vowel after the &#x201c;l&#x201d;). Imbolg means &#x201c;in the belly&#x201d; and refers specifically to the pregnancy of the sheep, and more broadly to Mother Earth quickening with new life. <br>A second name for this holiday is Oimelc (&#x201c;oy-melk&#x201d;), meaning &#x201c;ewe&#x2019;s milk,&#x201d; since the ewes were lactating for their new lambs. A folk verse from the Isle of Man makes oblique reference to the abundant milk, calling the holiday &#x201c;White Brigid&#x2019;s Day.&#x201d; Milk was not simply for the lambs, or a nice beverage for people to drink with their cookies, but an important part of the family&#x2019;s nourishment. Because it was precious, it was worthy of the gods; so an offering of milk might be left out overnight, or poured out on the threshold or the ground, as a libation to thank the goddess and encourage still more bounty. <br>Imbolg is also considered one of the four great Celtic fire festivals, &#x201c;but here the emphasis is on light rather than heat, the strengthening spark of light beginning to pierce the gloom of Winter.&#x201d;7 The days technically begin to lengthen at Yule, the Winter Solstice, but by Imbolg we can clearly see the change. Truly the sun&#x2019;s light is with us longer each day. This is the first harbinger of spring, our assurance that the Wheel is turning and the long, warm days of summer will return. The Scots celebrate the growing light not only with Imbolg but also with Up-Kelly-Aa, a fire festival on January 28 that honors the sun goddess. <br>It is a busy time of year, and the air is filled with anticipation. Housewives check the family pantry and root cellar, hoping that enough food remains to feed the family through the spring; in the barn, the farmer casts a practiced eye over his hay and grain&#x2015;it&#x2019;s a long way yet to the harvest! But with luck and the goddess&#x2019; blessing, the fields will be ready for ploughing soon. In the coastal villages the fisherfolk carefully check their boats for winter damage and begin to repair their nets. <br>Imbolg is about the first signs of spring, the promise of returning life, about sunlight and ripening and the growing conviction that the community will survive another year. Marion Green, who lives in England, brings the feeling to life as she says, &#x201c;Mother Nature is seen as being renewed at this time; she becomes the Maiden of Spring, when the lambs&#x2019; tails of hazel catkins tremble on the bare branches, and the hardiest of bulbs begin their new lease of life, thrusting green spears through the thawing mould. . . . The gamboling lambs seemed to herald the warmer days to come, and overhead, the harbingers of spring, the overwintering birds, were beginning to verbally stake their claims on their territory and sing a song of mating as the weeks of February passed by.&#x201d;8 <br>After a long, hard winter, who could look forward to all this and not want to celebrate? <br>The Norse Festivals of February <br>In this season of abundant celebrations, the Norse were by no means lacking in the festival spirit. Prudence Priest, an Asatru priestess, explains that &#x201c;Among Norse/Teutonic heathens &#x2018;Valentine&#x2019;s Day&#x2019; has long been celebrated as the Feast of Vali, the Honor of Vara, and even occasionally as the climax of Barri. These heathens are known for their rowdy celebrations. . . .&#x201d;9 <br>The Feast of Vali is a solar festival marking the strengthening power of the sun, the beginning of the end of winter, and the survival of the community. It also celebrates loyalty and kinship, and is named after Vali, a son of Woden whose role in mythology was to avenge the death of the beloved god Baldur. <br>The Honor of Vara is a lunar festival in which the community witnesses and celebrates the vows of lovers. Vara is the goddess who hears us when we swear oaths or make promises, and stands for truth and responsibility. She has been called &#x201c;the Norse Athena,&#x201d; and is also analogous to Ma&#x2019;at, the Egyptian goddess of truth. Vara is a companion of Freya, &#x201c;The Lady&#x201d; who is essentially the Norse Queen of the Gods. <br>Barri is a fertility festival that technically takes place at the lunar New Year, though most Norse religionists simply celebrate it beginning February 1 or 2 and until the full moon in Leo. It commemorates the courtship of the giantess, Gerda, symbolizing Mother Earth, by Freyr, god of ferti...</p><h2>Strength And Honor: The Life Of Dolley Madison</h2><p>Based on more than two thousand of Dolley Payne Todd Madison&#39;s letters and accompanied by period illustrations, offers a biography of the popular First Lady who was renowned as a hostess and heroine of the War of 1812.</p><p>From an upper window in the President&#x2019;s House, Dolley Madison peered in vain through her telescope, desperate for a glimpse of her returning husband, James, who was on the battlefield with his troops. Six miles away, British soldiers had overrun the American defenders. Now they marched directly toward the heart of Washington City. Their orders were clear: destroy the public buildings and secure the submission of the United States. <p>Dolley dashed off a note to her sister, Lucy. "My husband...enquired anxiously whether I had courage, or firmness to remain in the President's house until his return... and on my assurance that I had no fear but for him and the success of our army, he left me, beseeching me to take care of myself, and of the cabinet papers, public and private." In the brief time she had to save the nation&#x2019;s treasures, Dolley directed that the large wall portrait of George Washington be broken from its frame and evacuated. She did not flee until the British were nearly on her doorstep. </p><p>Expecting an American victory, the president had directed his French chef to prepare a sumptuous meal for him and his staff that afternoon. Neither James nor Dolley Madison could have conceived that the diners that evening would all be British soldiers, who gleefully ate the food, drank the wine, and then burned the White House to the ground.

His best known oils, such as <em>Nighthawks</em>, <em>Early Sunday Morning</em>, and <em>House by a Railroad</em>, are powerful psychological statements that convey a sense of angst and alienation.<br><br> Yet there is another Hopper we know less well: the freer, more spontaneous spirit that emerges in his watercolors. In 1923 he spent a summer in Gloucester, Massachusetts, and began painting houses, landscapes, and fishing boats. In them he captures remnants of nineteenth-century America that for him symbolized the fundamental character of the country's people and places, and prompted him to reexamine his views about the relationship between the past and the modern. Over the next two decades, Hopper painted hundreds of watercolors, in Gloucester, the coast of Maine, New Mexico, and Cape Cod.<br><br> This beautiful book reproduces and examines over one hundred of Hopper's greatest watercolors in the context of his life and travels.

Employed mostly in the 1945 Okinawa campaign, they sank one U.S. destroyer at a cost of 438 pilots and crew members. The author, who took part in the wind-tunnel testing of the Okha , describes the flying bomb's conception, development and the training of the pilots. Volunteers were categorized as Compliant, Eager, Very Eager and--if they signed their application in blood--Earnest. Missions are described from the mother-plane crew's point of view or by Okha pilots who were not launched at the target for one reason or another.

He scanned the top message briefly, initialled it, and then walked across the pilothouse where Commander Johnston Michael Montgomery was trying to stay awake in the warm morning sunshine."Priority action, Captain," said O'Connor. "A little bit off the beaten path, too."The Captain stretched, and sat up in his bridge chair. The chair protested. Mike Montgomery was a large man, with an oversized, straight nosed, nordic face, permanently ruddy complexioned from years at sea, with bushy white blond eyebrows and a shock of blond hair tinged with gray brushed straight back from a wide forehead. He wore the regulation Navy at-sea working uniform of wash khaki trousers and short sleeved khaki shirt, with the tarnished silver oak leaves of a Commander, USN, pinned to the points of his shirt collar, and a gold command at sea star on his right shirt pocket. A pair of hand-tooled, black leather sea boots rucked up the hem of his trousers. He had largehands and massively muscled forearms; the metal message board looked like a piece of paper in his hands."Everything we do is a little bit off the beaten path, Tim. Lemme see it."The Captain's voice had a booming quality even when he was calm. He scanned the message. The rest of the bridge watch looked on with interest. The Bosun Mate of the Watch tried to get the radio messenger to let him in on the message. The messenger, a radioman who considered himself superior to all bosun mates, ignored him."Well, you're right, Timothy. This is indeed different. Get the XO up here, please. Quartergasket!"The Quartermaster of the Watch stepped forward from his chart table. "Aye, Sir?""Plot this position, and give me a course at eighteen knots.""Aye, aye, Sir."The Captain turned back around in his chair, and reached for his lukewarm cup of coffee. Goddamn bosun mates were putting salt in it again; somebody had to talk to them. He knew the bridge watch was dying to know what was going on; he would let them eavesdrop when the Executive Officer, Lieutenant Commander Ben Farmer, arrived. He leaned back in the bridge chair.Typical bullshit squirrel assignment for Goldsborough, he thought. The Coast Guard had forwarded a report from one of the Mayport fishermen claiming to have sighted a U-boat out on the edge of the Gulf Stream. Montgomery, a bachelor who lived in the fishing village of Mayport behind the Mayport naval base, knew most of the commercial fishermen personally. He could just see it. Some old fart like Christian Mayfield, stumbling out on deck in the morning twilight to piss over the side after a night-long session with Dr. James Beam and shaking with the predawn D.T.'s, sees a frigging U-boat. Right. Thinks he's back on the convoys. Lucky he didn't fall over the side in the excitement. And now Goldsborough, the one antique steam powered destroyer among all the new gas turbine powered frigates and destroyers in Mayport, would get to go out a hundred milesto the Gulf Stream and look for a U-boat. He sighed noisily. This was the kind of operational assignment which tended to confirm his suspicion that his career, just like Goldsborough's, was drawing to a close.The Executive Officer appeared on the bridge from the doorway leading to CIC. Lieutenant Commander Ben Farmer was a chunky man, with a round face and a prematurely gray head of hair."Yes, Sir, Captain. Quartermaster called me and said we have to look for a--submarine?" The bridge watch team members pricked up their ears while trying to appear as if they were not eavesdropping."Yeah, XO. Another Weird-Harold mission for the Goldy-maru. One of the shrimp boats skippers called the Coast Guard on the Marine radio, says he saw a U-boat, gave a position. Group Twelve wants it investigated."The Exec scanned the message. "But this was, hell, twenty-four hours ago," he complained. "Yesterday morning. That's a pretty big time-late. We were supposed to go in tonight. A hundred miles out, a hundred miles back, and some search time, we're looking at another day in the opareas.""You broka-da-code, XO. I sense the slick claws of J. Walker Martinson, Chief of Staff to the Lord High Admiral George T., behind this little trip."The quartermaster interrupted. "Sir, we need 085 to get to the original sighting posit.""Very well. Mr. O'Connor, 085 at eighteen knots, please.""Aye, aye, Sir." O'Connor gave the orders to the helm and lee helm. There was a jangle of engine order telegraph bells, and moments later Goldsborough swung her aging 4000 tons of steel around to the east and headed for the Gulf Stream. A light breeze began to stream through the pilothouse, rustling the charts on the chart table and stirring the general fug of cigarettes and stale coffee.The Captain crumpled his paper coffee cup, and pitched it through the bridge wing door over the side. "XO, make an announcement to the crew that we're going out to investigatean unidentified submarine sighting report, and that our return to port will probably be delayed until tomorrow.""Aye, aye, Sir." Farmer stepped closer, and said in a low voice, "Do you really believe that they saw a real submarine?"The Captain shifted his large frame in the chair."No, XO. I don't. And what's more, if Group Twelve thought it was a real sighting, they wouldn't be sending us --they'd get one of the new Spruance class guys underway, send a real ASW ship out to take a look. But, what the hell; it beats boring holes in the ocean doing CIC non-maneuvering tracking exercises."The XO squinted at the message again. He needed glasses, but refused to get a pair."Yes, Sir. I guess so," he said. "We'll have to hold an ASW brief this afternoon, say, 1330. If we're gonna do this thing, we'll need to post the blue and gold ASW teams. That's four on-four off watches, until we give it up. They say how long we're to look for this--er, U-boat?""Nope. So I'll mess with it all night, and then we'll do a Unless Otherwise Directed message and come the hell in. We've gotta get these boilers off the line; both of 'em are blowing steam, and I want to get those HP drain valves unscrewed by the end of next week so we can still go on the Fleet exercise."The Exec nodded. "I'll tell Ops to file a new moverep.""OK, XO."The Captain sat back in his chair. The bridge cooled off noticeably as the ship picked up to eighteen knots and headed seaward. The bridge watch talked quietly among themselves about the sudden ASW mission. The word quickly spread through the ship, as the phone talkers chattered on their sound powered telephones to the lookouts and the main engineering spaces.Mike Montgomery had been in command for almost two years. His selection for destroyer command had been exciting; his assignment to command Goldsborough had been something of a disappointment. Goldsborough was atwenty-seven year old, all-gun destroyer, armed with three automatic five-inch bore naval rifles, anti-submarine torpedoes, and even an ancient depth charge rack on the stern, courtesy of a senior admiral's pet project to get depth charges back into the fleet. She had four high pressure steam boilers which could drive her at thirty two knots if everything in the main spaces stayed steam-tight, which rarely happened. From the waterline up, she presented the classic lines of a large, modern destroyer, although her ability to defend herself against modern jet aircraft had long ago been eclipsed by high performance anti-ship missiles. Her Achilles heel was the elderly steam propulsion plant, compounded by an aging hull. Most of her class had been decommissioned when maintenance costs had begun to overrun operational capability. Goldsborough was now the sole remaining steam-powered destroyer based at the Mayport naval base, surrounded by the newer gas turbine driven Spruance class destroyers, which, at 8000 tons, were twice her size and one-third her age.Because of her age, Goldsborough had been taken off the deployment list, which meant that she did not go overseas with the carrier groups on their six month deployments anymore. She stayed home and took part in fleet exercises and other training evolutions in the waters off Florida and occasionally in the Caribbean. She had inherited the role of semi-permanent duty destroyer, which meant that she was on call for all sorts of pop-up missions, like this one.Mike had long ago realized that not being able to take his ship on deployment meant that he had become a marginal prospect for promotion to full Captain, USN. The selection boards for Captain paid a great deal of attention to fitness reports written by carrier battle group commanders on their destroyer skippers, especially during deployment operations overseas. On the other hand, Goldsborough was much sought after as an assignment by the enlisted men, whose promotions were dependent more on time in service and competitive examination than on deployments. For many, whose wives had found good jobs in the area, not having to go overseas for six months at acrack was as close as the enlisted could get to a homesteading situation and still be on regular sea duty.Duty on Goldsborough was pleasant enough. The base at Mayport, placed at the mouth of the St. Johns river, near Jacksonville, Florida, was small enough to be friendly and personal. There were only two admirals, and one of those was usually deployed overseas. Career Navymen understood that the importance of petty regulations varied directly with the number and seniority of admirals present, and thus Mayport was a pleasantly laid-back naval station, especially when compared to the huge fleet operating bases up north in Charleston and Norfolk."It'll take us until 1530 to reach the datum, Captain," said the Quartermaster, interrupting his reverie. He refocused on the submarine problem."Very well. OOD, we'll have an all-officers at 1330 for ASW action brief. I'm going below.""Aye, aye, Sir. I'll get the word passed."The Captain stood down from his chair, and stretched. The sea was absolutely flat calm, and its surface had gone from bronze to silvery gray in the haze of a typical late spring day off the Florida coast. In the distance the surface of the sea was dotted with small fishing boats, cabin cruisers, and the occasional commercial fisherman or shrimper with nets over the side. On the horizon, one of the massive, 60,000 ton Toyota car-carriers was getting larger as she closed in on the entrance to the St. Johns river for the run up to the port of Jacksonville.Mike wondered at the thought of a fishing boat Skipper seeing a U-boat. Most of the Skippers he knew would not recognize a submarine if they fell over one, and some were often not sober enough to know they had bumped into something. As a bachelor, he had spent enough evenings in the back bar at Hampton's Fish House with the fishermen to know something about their drinking habits. This was undoubtedly going to be a major waste of time. He let himself through the door at the back of the pilothouse and headed below to his cabin.Copyright � 1992 by George Mason University Press.</p><h2>Reference Guide for Essential Oils Soft Cover 2016</h2><p>Join the millions of individuals who are rediscovering the natural healing powers of essential oils!

Rudolf Steiner provides a step-by-step account of how we can come to experience living, intuitive thinking, the conscious experience of pure spirit.&nbsp;<br><br>Since this book was written more than a century ago, many have tried to discover the kind of new thinking that can help us better understand the spiritual, ecological, social, political, and philosophical issues that face us.

As a young man, he lived in Weimar and Berlin, where he became a well-published scientific, literary, and philosophical scholar, known especially for his work with Goethe&#x2019;s scientific writings. At the beginning of the twentieth century, he began to develop his early philosophical principles into an approach to systematic research into psychological and spiritual phenomena. Formally beginning his spiritual teaching career under the auspices of the Theosophical Society, Steiner came to use the term Anthroposophy (and spiritual science) for his philosophy, spiritual research, and findings. The influence of Steiner&#x2019;s multifaceted genius has led to innovative and holistic approaches in medicine, various therapies, philosophy, religious renewal, Waldorf education, education for special needs, threefold economics, biodynamic agriculture, Goethean science, architecture, and the arts of drama, speech, and eurythmy. In 1924, Rudolf Steiner founded the General Anthroposophical Society, which today has branches throughout the world.

Rebutting charges that the financial collapse was caused by conservative deregulatory zeal, Schweizer, the author of <em>Do as I Say (Not as I Do): Profiles in Liberal Hypocrisy,</em> shows that it was actually the result of &#x201c;do-good capitalism.&#x201d;</p></p><p><blockquote><p>Was the financial collapse caused by free-market capitalism and deregulation run amok, as liberals claim?</p><p>Not on your life, says Peter Schweizer. What we are really witnessing is a massive failure of social engineering by liberals.</p></blockquote><p><em>Architects of Ruin</em>, bestselling author Peter Schweizer describes in riveting detail how a coalition of left-wing activists, liberal politicians, and "do-good capitalists" on Wall Street leveraged government power to achieve their goal of broadening homeownership among minorities and the poor. The results were not only devastating to the economy, but hurt the very people they were supposedly trying to help.</p><p>The story begins in the 1960s with Saul Alinsky, the legendary Chicago rabble-rouser who trained his acolytes in highly aggressive techniques of community activism. Alinsky's disciples&#x2014;along with race-baiting activists like Jesse Jackson&#x2014;seized on the "redlining" controversy of those years to argue that banks were guilty of racial discrimination. In the 1970s, with the help of liberal senators like Ted Kennedy and William Proxmire, legislation was passed that put bankers under the thumb of local activists. </p><p>In the Clinton years, a new generation of liberal technocrats came to power in Washington and on Wall Street. Schweizer describes how a powerful phalanx of elite liberals, including Bill Clinton, Robert Rubin, Andrew Cuomo, Barney Frank, Chris Dodd, Janet Reno, Deval Patrick, Henry Cisneros, Barack Obama, Nancy Pelosi, Ted Kennedy, Charles Schumer, and many others, aggressively pushed banks to make trillions of dollars in loans to individuals who should never have received them.</p><p> Meanwhile, Clinton forged a new form of state capitalism in which the big Wall Street financial companies were repeatedly bailed out&#x2014;with their profits intact&#x2014;from a series of costly errors, leading them to take ever larger risks. Both financial policies had profoundly distorting effects. The result was the bursting of twin bubbles in mortgages and mortgage-backed derivatives, in turn leading to a global economic collapse. </p> <p>This tale of liberal "Robin Hood capitalism run wild" has never been told. But more than just a story about the past, it is also an urgent warning about the future. For today, the very same people who planted the seeds of the collapse are back in Washington, tasked with cleaning up the mess and determined to use the crisis they caused as cover for a massive overhaul of the American economic system. </p><p>These people have learned nothing from their past mistakes and are busy applying the same methods to other sectors of the economy&#x2014;health care, the auto industry, real estate (again!), and above all the promotion of "green" technologies&#x2014;inflating bubbles that are sure to bring about another crisis. Ordinary Americans who foot the bill for the last state-capitalist bubble have reason to be afraid&#x2014;very afraid&#x2014;of the inevitable result.</p><p>Peter Schweizer is the author of, among other books, <em>Clinton Cash,</em>&nbsp;<em>Extortion</em>, <em>Throw Them All Out</em>, and <em>Architects of Ruin.</em> He has been featured throughout the media, including on <em>60 Minutes </em>and&nbsp;in the <em>New York Times</em>.

He lives in New York City.<b>Part One: Tim Underhill</b><br><br>Chapter 1 <br><br>An alcoholic homicide detective in my hometown of Millhaven, Illinois, William Damrosch, died to ensure, you might say, that this book would never be written. But you write what comes back to you, and then afterward it comes back to you all over again. <br><br>I once wrote a novel called <i>The Divided Man</i> about the Blue Rose murders, and in that book I called Damrosch Hal Esterhaz. I never alluded to my own connections to the Blue Rose murders, but those connections were why I wrote the book. (There was one other reason, too.) I wanted to explain things to myself&#x2014;to see if I could slice through to the truth with that old, old weapon, the battered old sword, of story telling. <br><br>I wrote <i>The Divided Man</i> after I was processed out of the army and had settled into a little room near Bang Luk, the central flower market in Bangkok. In Vietnam I had killed several people at long distance and one close up, so close that his face was right before me. In Bangkok, that face kept coming back to me while I was writing. And with it came, attached like an enormous barnacle to a tiny boat, the other Vietnam, the Vietnam before Vietnam, of childhood. When my childhood began coming back to me, I went off the rails for a bit. I became what you could charitably call "colorful." After a year or so of disgrace, I remembered that I was thirty-odd years old, no longer a child, that I had a calling of a kind, and I began to heal. Either childhood is a lot more painful the second time around, or it's just less bearable. None of us are as strong or as brave as the children we used to be. <br><br>About a year after I straightened out, I came back to America and wound up writing a couple of books with a novelist named Peter Straub. These were called <i>Koko</i> and <i>Mystery</i>, and maybe you read them. It's okay if you didn't. Peter's a nice enough kind of guy, and he lives in a big gray Victorian house in Connecticut, just off Long Island Sound. He has a wife and two kids, and he doesn't get out much. Peter's office on the third floor of his house was the size of my whole loft on Grand Street, and his air conditioning and his sound system always worked. <br><br>Peter liked listening to my descriptions of Millhaven. He was fascinated with the place. He understood exactly how I felt about it. "In Millhaven, snow falls in the middle of summer," I'd say, "sometimes in Millhaven, flights of angels blot out the whole sky," and he'd beam at me for about a minute and a half. Here are some other things I told him about Millhaven: once, on the near south side of town, a band of children killed a stranger, dismembered him, and buried the pieces of his body beneath a juniper tree, and later the divided and buried parts of the body began to call out to each other; once a rich old man raped his daughter and kept her imprisoned in a room where she raved and drank, raved and drank, without ever remembering what had happened to her; once the pieces of the murdered man buried beneath the juniper tree called out and caused the children to bring them together; once a dead man was wrongly accused of terrible crimes. And once, when the parts of the dismembered man were brought together at the foot of the tree, the whole man rose and spoke, alive again, restored. <br><br>For we were writing about a mistake committed by the Millhaven police and endorsed by everyone else in town. The more I learned, the worse it got: along with everyone else, I had assumed that William Damrosch had finally killed himself to stop himself from murdering people, or had committed suicide out of guilt and terror over the murders he had already done. Damrosch had left a note with the words BLUE ROSE on the desk in front of him. <br><br>But this was an error of interpretation&#x2014;of imagination. What most of us call intelligence is really imagination&#x2014;sympathetic imagination. The Millhaven police were wrong, and I was wrong. For obvious reasons, the police wanted to put the case to rest; I wanted to put it to rest for reasons of my own.<br>I've been living in New York for six years now. Every couple of months I take the New Haven Line from Grand Central, get off at the Greens Farms stop, and stay up late at night drinking and talking with Peter. He drinks twenty-five-year-old malt whiskey, because he's that kind of guy, and I drink club soda. His wife and his kids are asleep and the house is quiet. I can see stars through his office skylight, and I'm aware of the black bowl of night over our heads, the huge darkness that covers half the planet. Now and then a car swishes down the street, going to Burying Hill Beach and Southport. <br><br><i>Koko</i> described certain things that happened to members of my old platoon in and after the war, and <i>Mystery</i> was about the long-delayed aftermath of an old murder in a Wisconsin resort. Because we liked the idea, we set the novel on a Caribbean island, but the main character, Tom Pasmore&#x2014;who will turn up later in these pages&#x2014;was someone I knew back in Millhaven. He was intimately connected with the Blue Rose murders blamed on William Damrosch, and a big part of <i>Mystery</i> is his discovery of this connection. <br><br>After <i>Mystery</i> I thought I was done with Damrosch, with Millhaven, and with the Blue Rose murders. Then I got a call from John Ransom, another old Millhaven acquaintance, and because much in his life had changed, my life changed too. John Ransom still lived in Millhaven. His wife had been attacked and beaten into a coma, and her attacker had scrawled the words BLUE ROSE on the wall above her body.</p><h2>Thomas Paine and the Promise of America</h2><p><b>America&#x2019;s unfinished revolution </b><br><br>The&nbsp;revolutionary spirit that runs through American history and whose&nbsp;founding&nbsp;father and greatest advocate was Thomas Paine is fiercely traced in<i> Thomas Paine and the Promise of America</i>.&nbsp;Showing how Paine turned Americans into radicals&#x2014;and how we have remained radicals at heart ever since&#x2014;Harvey J.

The period from Nullification in 1932 until Fort Sumter in 1861 constituted a long period of cold war, even by today&#39;s standards. Men who opposed one another in 1832 had gone to their rewards when the shooting began, and the generation in the South which was to die had not been born when South Carolina first defied the Union. The quarrel was passed on, from generation to generation until the men who settled it in the bloodiest way possible had little notion of what had started it. In History of the Confederacy, Clifford Dowdey surveys the gathering-the disparity between North and South economically, South Carolina&#39;s defiance of the federal Tariff Act of 1832, the stark horror of Nat Turner&#39;s Rebellion and its subsequent harvest of fear, and the conflict between ways of life within the South itself. In this stirring and thoughtful work we see Davis, Calhoun, Tooms, Stephens, Jackson, Levy, all waiting to take their parts in the tragedy that was to be played out on their own beloved land. From Mr. Dowdey&#39;s story of the Civil War itself-from Fort Sumter to Appomattox-emerges the unforgettable picture of a young army that grew into the dedicated and valiant force that fought for Lee-and for the land of the South. This is history seen through the eyes of the men who lived it-and told in a masterly fashion by one of today&#39;s most eminent historians.</p><p></p><h2>Reckoning (Star Wars: Last of the Jedi, Book 10)</h2><p>The shocking conclusion to The Last of the Jedi series!<br><br>Former Jedi apprentice Ferus Olin must choose -- the way of the Jedi... or the dark side?

So let's just say it has naked pictures of Natasha Richardson...Can't say that? Well, let's say it's a nasty farce with lots of bathroom humor and violence which reminds me at least as much of Fawlty Towers as it does of Midnight's Children.'<br><br>-- Jay McInerney<br><br>A postmodern detective story, a scathing send-up of the rapacious eighties, a macabre Gothic -- all rolled up in a bravura tragicomic entertainment.<br><br>The Winshaw family, as their official biographer is warned by old Mortimer Winshaw himself, is the meanest, greediest, cruellest bunch of backstabbing penny-pinching bastards who ever crawled across the face of the earth.' Bankers, industrialists, politicians, arms dealers and media barons -- they rule Britannia, more or less. They also have a guilty secret in the shape of a mad aunt stashed away in a remote asylum, convinced of familial treachery during World War II and determined to effect the ruin of her entire clan.<br><br>In the summer of 1990, while Saddam Hussein is provoking yet another war, the Winshaws' biographer (a severely depressed young novelist) is piecing together the truth of their sordid legacy, and discovers that it converges bizarrely with the plot of a film he's been obsessed by since childhood. Moreover, it seems that all of this, dynasty and cinema alike, has some mysterious connection with his own troubled history. Of course whether he -- or anybody else -- will be alive when this compound riddle is solved remains to be seen.<br><br>Savagely funny, hugely inventive and passionately political. The Winshaw Legacy assumes Dickensian proportions as it excoriates the modern age of greed -- and heralds the American debut of an extraordinary writer. As The Economist concluded: Talented comic novelists are rare [but] that exclusive club -- Thomas Love Peacock, Evelyn Waugh and P. G. Wodehouse are among its members -- has admitted a newcomer, an Englishman called Jonathan Coe.'<br><br>'A remarkable achievement; intelligent, funny, and important.' -- The Times Literary Supplement<br><br>'An extravagant literary blockbuster...A grand and intelligent novel, so full of accomplishment and pleasure.' -- New Statesman &amp; Society'<br><br>Really, something to get excited about...his big, hilarious, intricate, furious, moving treat of a novel.' -- The Guardian</p><p>Born in Birmingham in 1961, Jonathan Coe took degrees from Cambridge and Warwick universities. He lives in London.In this patchily entertaining postmodern pastiche of class warfare, Coe places Michael Owen, a burnt-out middle-class writer, as the family chronicler of the Winshaws, an upper-class British dynasty involved in everything wrong with modern England: television and tabloid journalism (Hilary, the hack); Thatcherite politics and National Health Service Reform (Henry, the back-stabber); industrialized agriculture (the beastly Dorothy); insider stock trading (Thomas, the voyeur); and arms dealing with Iraq (the callous Mark). Coe's contemporary vile bodies are not only utterly unprincipled, greedy and philistine, but their presentation is uninspired and unamusing as well, contracting these issues down to a distinctly parochial dimension. Sandwiching their corrupt stories is an intricate comic plot out of the murder-at-the-manor genre, weirdly reflected in Owen's obsession with an old movie in which he is convinced he stars and which determines his fate. Coe's dry, deflating Midlands sense of humor infrequently rises above the episodes of scrupulously didactic satire and works well with the more quotidian social ills, such as telly-addiction and the unending waits in NHS hospitals. The narrative becomes more interesting toward the end, when Coe gets around to murdering a number of his characters, but since they never become quite real in the first place, the reader doesn't really care. A story closer to this mundane Britain of post-Thatcher disaffection would have been more welcome for his American debut than agitprop Waugh-mongering. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>James Wright: A Life in Poetry</h2><p><p><b>The authorized and sweeping biography of one of America&#x2019;s most complex, influential, and enduring poets</b></p><p>In the extraordinary generation of American poets who came of age in the middle of the twentieth century, James Wright (1927&#x2013;1980) was frequently placed at the top of the list.

New York City newspapers reported his death on their front pages. ("Crimson Tears," read the headline in the <i>New York Post</i>, "Nation weeps over death of legendary Bear Bryant, 69.") Three days later, America watched in awe as an estimated quarter of a million mourners lined the fifty-five mile stretch from Tuscaloosa to a Birmingham cemetery to pay their respects as his three-mile long funeral cortege drove by.<br><br>President Reagan and the three former American presidents sent flowers, as did people as diverse as Bob Hope, ABC's Roone Arledge, advice columnist Ann Landers and the Reverend Billy Graham. Scores of Bryant's former players, including Joe Namath, Lee Roy Jordan, Ken Stabler and Ozzie Newsome, were in attendance. So were Bryant's most distinguished colleagues, the greatest living football coaches, including Southern Cal's John McKay, who said, "It was like a presidential funeral procession. No coach in America could have gotten that. No coach but him. But then, he wasn't just a coach. He was the coach."<br><br>Bryant's passing was noted with the kind of reverence our country reserved for statesmen or military leaders, though Paul "Bear" Bryant had insisted for much of his life that he was "just a football coach." For millions he was much more, he was the greatest coach the game ever saw, the heir to the tradition established by Knute Rockne. He took his Alabama Crimson Tide teams to an unmatched six national championships. But to the players, journalists and fans whose lives he touched in his more than half a century as a player and coach, he was the last symbol of values that transcended football&#x2014;courage, discipline, loyalty, and hard work.<br><br>To his critics, Bryant represented the dark side of big-time college football&#x2014;brutality, fanaticism and blind adherence to authority. The real Bear Bryant was far more complex than either his admirers or detractors knew. While maintaining a public friendship with Alabama governor George Wallace, he continually sought ways to undermine the governor's segregationist policies, finally forcing a legendary football game in Birmingham with the University of Southern California that opened the floodgates to the integration of football at the University of Alabama, including its coaching staff. Old fashioned in his politics, he was nonetheless an admirer of Robert Kennedy, whom he planning to vote for in 1968.<br><br>Allen Barra's <i>The Last Coach</i> traces Paul Bryant's rise from a family of truck farmers to recognition as the most successful and influential coach in the game's history. The eleventh of thirteen children, Bryant was born in tiny Moro Bottom, Arkansas in 1913 and grew up in nearby Fordyce&#x2014;where his legend was born when he wrestled a live bear on the stage of a local theater. Paul was raised by his mother, who barely managed to keep him out of trouble and on the Fordyce High School Redbugs long enough to get a football scholarship at Alabama, where he would meet and marry the love of his life, campus beauty queen Mary Harmon Black.<br><br>At the height of the Depression, football took Bryant to the Rose Bowl with Alabama's 1934 national champions and on to a career as an assistant and, finally, a head football coach, where he matched wit and grit with the greatest coaches of two generations, men like Tennessee's General Robert Neyland, Oklahoma's Bud Wilkinson, Notre Dame's Ara Parseghian, Ohio State's Woody Hayes, and Penn State's Joe Paterno. Along the way, he stirred controversy with his infamous "Junction Boys" training camp in 1954, during which almost two-thirds of the Texas A&amp;M football team quit; his legal battle with <i>The Saturday Evening Post</i> over the accusation that he had conspired to fix a college football game, a trial which rocked the sports world; and his pursuit of Amos Alonzo Stagg's all-time record for college coaching victories.<br><br>Through it all, Bryant's influence has not only endured but prevailed as his former players and assistants continue to define the best in not only college but professional football. 32 pages of photographs.</p><p>A native of Alabama, <b>Allen Barra</b> contributes regularly to the <i>Wall Street Journal, The New York Times</i>, and <i>Slate</i>. He is the author of <i>Clearing the Bases: The Greatest Baseball Debates of the Last Century</i>. He lives in South Orange, New Jersey.<i>Starred Review.</i> This meticulous, fascinating look at the life of the legendary "Bear" Bryant (1913&#x2013;1983), longtime head football coach of the University of Alabama's fearsome "Crimson Tide," will further enhance the reputation of Barra (<i>Clearing the Bases</i>) as one of America's finest sportswriters. It begins with a powerful and unsentimental view of Bryant's difficult childhood in Moro Bottom, Ark., an area Barra describes as "the reality of which Al Capp's Dogpatch, the home of L'il Abner, was the hideous caricature." It ends with a moving description of Bryant's death, just 27 days after his final game and retirement, and the three-mile-long funeral procession viewed by an estimated quarter of a million people. In between, Barra covers Bryant's rise as a cultural and sports icon whose influence helped transform college football "from a game with a large cult following into the most lucrative spectator sport in the world." Among the many incidents Barra deftly explores are Bryant's hesitancy&#x2014;followed by his thoroughness&#x2014;in integrating the Alabama team (in 1971), and his visionary use of televised games in the early 1960s&#x2014;which he accomplished with ABC sports broadcasting superstar Roone Arledge, then a 29-year-old rookie&#x2014;to establish himself and his team (including flamboyant players such as Joe Namath) in the minds of a national sports audience. Throughout, Barra illuminates the complexities of what he sees as Bryant's legacies: "his intensity and will to win and his unshakable belief that these qualities, when applied to a higher purpose, can make you a better person."

"Unfortunately, that advice is sometimes biased or ill-informed," says John McDougall, M.D. "The consequence is that a lot of women choose treatments that are ineffective at best, or harmful at worst." In <i>The McDougall Program for Women</i>, he discusses the most common medical conditions affecting women, such as breast cancer, menopause, cardiovascular disease, and osteoporosis (don't miss his explanation of how high consumption of animal protein destroys bones). He describes how best to treat these conditions and the benefits and risks of the usual treatments. His solution to women's health problems isn't hormones, drugs, or surgery--it's diet and lifestyle changes, specifically a starch-based, vegetarian diet, moderate exercise, and eliminating the "most toxic of [your] bad habits," such as smoking.<p> McDougall is well known from his other books and his program at St. Helena Hospital in California, with a loyal bevy of followers who report tremendous health gains and weight loss by eating mainly bulky complex carbohydrates (whole grains, beans, legumes, starchy vegetables), no meat or dairy products, and no added oil. The 102 recipes show that this eating plan can be varied and tasty. This is no trendy diet-of-the-month scheme--McDougall includes 82 pages of scientific references that support his views. <i>--Joan Price</i></p><b>John McDougall, M.D</b>., is the author of many previous books, including <b>The McDougall Program, The McDougall Program for Maximum Weight Loss</b>, and <b>The New McDougall Cookbook</b>.

In a hundred and seventeen shrewd, surreal vignettes, Sachs lays bare the petty rivalries, thwarted affection, and mutual bafflement that have characterized the filial bond since the days of Davidic kings. A philosopher&#x2019;s son kills his father and explains his aphorisms to death. A father bequeaths to his son his jacket, deodorant, and political beliefs. England&#x2019;s most famous medium becomes possessed by the spirit of his skeptical father&#x2014;who questions, in front of the nation, his son&#x2019;s choice of career. A Czech pianist amputates his fingers one by one to thwart his father, who will not stop composing concertos for him. A nineteenth-century Italian nobleman wills his ill-conceived flying contraption&#x2014;incapable of actual flight&#x2014;to his newborn son. In West Hollywood, an aspiring screenwriter must contend with the judgmental visage of his father, a respected public intellectual whose frozen head, clearly disappointed in him, he keeps in his freezer. Keenly inventive, but painfully familiar, these surprisingly tender stories signal the arrival of a brilliant new comic voice&#x2014;and fresh hope for fathers and sons the world over.</p><p><b>Adam Ehrlich Sachs&nbsp;</b>studied atmospheric science at Harvard, where he wrote for the&nbsp;<i>Harvard Lampoon</i>.

This is the story of how TR took on Manhattan vice . . . and vice won. </b><br> <br>In the 1890s, New York City was America&#x2019;s financial, manufacturing, and entertainment capital, and also its preferred destination for sin, teeming with forty thousand prostitutes, glittery casinos, and all-night dives. Police cap�tains took hefty bribes to see nothing while reformers writhed in frustration. <br><br> In <i>Island of Vice</i>, Richard Zacks paints a vivid portrait of the lewd underbelly of 1890s New York, and of Theodore Roosevelt, the puritanical, cocksure police commissioner resolved to clean it up. Writing with great wit and zest, Zacks explores how young Roosevelt goes head to head with Tammany Hall, takes midnight rambles with muckraker Jacob Riis, and tries to convince two million New Yorkers to enjoy wholesome family fun. When Roosevelt&#x2019;s crackdown succeeds too well, even his supporters turn on him, and TR discovers that New York loves its sin more than its salvation. <br><br> With cameos by Stephen Crane, Mark Twain, and a horde of very angry cops, <i>Island of Vice</i> is an unforgettable snap�shot of turn-of-the-century New York in all its seedy glory and a brilliant miniature of one of America&#x2019;s most colorful presidents.</p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, March 2012</strong>: Those living in New York City today may be surprised (or not!) to read about the state of their city in the 1890&#x2019;s; overrun with prostitution, gambling, boot liquor and Tammany Hall, NYC was known as the &#x201c;Island of Vice.&#x201d; Enter the ever-ambitious Theodore Roosevelt, years before he became president, who stepped-in as the NYC Police Commissioner and made it his mission to clean up the city. Richard Zacks&#x2019; enthusiastic account of this period is a fun read&#x2014;an adjective rarely used to describe history books. It would be difficult to invent a cast of characters as exuberant and flawed as those involved here, and Zacks brings them all to life with ease.

She lives in Los Angeles, where she spends her time writing and raising twins.Julia Fletcher's chipper, brisk tone gives an efficient reading of Flanagan's conflicted ruminations. Flanagan questions major and minor decisions about working, raising children, and making a home. Fletcher's articulate voice smoothes over the m&amp;EACUTE;lange of essay topics that Flanagan has cobbled together. Fletcher does an admirable job establishing a consistent tone to express Flanagan's often contradictory thoughts about raising children and home care. She asks, for example, whether shopping for trendy containers counts as "house-cleaning." Flanagan's prose offers some bits of humor, which Fletcher delivers appropriately, but a title that seems to promise some true irreverence about the complications of daily life ultimately remains too inward-looking to truly satisfy.

Reprint. 20,000 first printing.</p><p>Most histories of the Seven Years' War focus on either the European or the North American theatre of the war. William Fowler's <i>Empires at War</i> is original, and praiseworthy, because he troubles to set the North American conflict in the European context. Bravo! Written in lively and engaging prose, <i>Empires at War</i> tells the story of what Fowler calls the "first world war." By keeping one foot in the North American wilderness and the other in the courts of Europe, Fowler makes a strong claim for the critical importance of early Canadian history to the history of the world. Fowler is also to be praised for the prominent role he assigns to the First Nations of eastern North America, who fought according to their own agendas and not merely as French or British auxiliaries. A third strength of this work is to found in Fowler's willingness to shatter myths. For example, many American historians have chosen to ignore George Washington's shameful conduct at Jumonville Glen, or they have looked for excuses for it. Fowler, to his credit, lays the blame right where it belongs: "It remains an open question why Washington felt compelled to attack a sleeping camp without warning at a time when two nations were at peace." Fowler is particularly good at fleshing out all of his characters: General Jeffrey Amherst is ruthless and brutal; James Wolfe nervous and complaining; the Marquis de Montcalm pessimistic and defeatist. The Seven Years&#x2019; War led directly to the American Revolution, the French Revolution, and the rise of Great Britain as a 19th-century superpower. It is vitally important that we learn more about these connections, and Fowler's <i>Empires at War</i> is a great place to start. <i>--William Newbigging</i><p>On May 28, 1754, a group of militia and Indians led by twenty-two-year-old major George Washington surprised a camp of sleeping French soldiers near present-day Pittsburgh. Washington could not have known it, but the brief and deadly exchange of fire that ensued lit the match that, in Horace Walpole's memorable phrase, would "set the world on fire." The resultung French and Indian War in North America became part of the global conflict known as the Seven Years War, fought across Europe, India, and the East and West Indies. Before it ended, nearly one million men had died.</p><p><i>Empires at War</i> captures the sweeping panorama of this first world war, especially in its descriptions of the strategy and intensity of the engagements in North America, many of them epic struggles between armies in the wilderness. William M. Fowler Jr. views the conflict both from British prime minister William Pitt's perspective-- as a vast chessboard, on which William Shirley's campaign in North America and the fortunes of Frederick the Great of Prussia were connected-- and from that of field commanders on the ground in America and Canada, who contended with disease, brutal weather, and scant supplies, frequently having to build the very roads they marched on. As in any conflict, individuals and events stand out: Sir William Johnson, a baronet and a major general of the British forces, who sometimes painted his face and dressed like a warrior when he fought beside his Indian allies; Edward Braddock's doomed march across Pennsylvania; the valiant French defense of Fort Ticonderoga; and the legendary battle for Quebec between armies led by the arisocratic French tactical genius, the marquis de Montcalm, and the gallant, if erratic, young Englishman James Wolfe-- both of whom died on the Plains of Abraham on September 13, 1759.</p><p>For many, the French and Indian War has been merely the backdrop for James Fenimore Cooper's famous novel, <i>The Last of the Mohicans</i>. William M. Fowler Jr.'s engrossing narrative reveals it to have been a turning point of modern history, without which the American Revolution as we know it might well not have occurred.</p><p><b>William M.

He is a former captain in the Air Force.<b>Chapter One <p> Zhukovsky Flight Research Center,<br> near Bykovo, Russian Federation<br> The next evening<br></p></b><p> </p><p> Even with many high-intensity lights ringing the area, it was almost impossible to see the big transport plane through the darkness and driving snowstorm as it taxied over to its parking spot. Its port-side turboprop engines, the ones facing the terminal building, the honor guard, a small band, and a group of waiting people, had already been shut down, and as soon as the plane was stopped by ground crews with lighted wands, the other two engines were also shut down. The ramp suddenly became eerily quiet, the only sound that of a long line of hearses' wheels crunching on snow. On one side of the transport plane's tail, seventeen hearses waited; on the other side were seventeen limousines for the family members, plus several official-looking government vehicles. From the official vehicles, two men surrounded by security guards alighted and took places beside the honor guard. </p><p> The transport's cargo ramp under the tall tail motored down, and the receiving detail marched over and stepped up the ramp, as the first limousine pulled out of line and maneuvered over to receive its passenger. The band began to play a solemn funeral march. A few moments later, the receiving detail slowly wheeled out the first casket, draped with the flag of the Russian Federation. As the honor guard and officials saluted and lowered flags in respect, a woman clothed all in black, wearing a black veil under her black beaver pelt hat, stepped forward from the line of limousines and reached out with both hands to gently touch the casket in silent greeting, as if wishing to not to disturb its occupant but to welcome him home. </p><p> Then, suddenly, her grief turned to anger. She cried aloud in anguish, piercing the frigid, snowy evening like a gunshot. She pushed the attendants aside, then grasped the Russian Federation flag in her gloved hands, pulled it off the casket, flung it to the ground, and rested her right cheek on the smooth gray surface of the casket's lid, sobbing loudly. A young man, tall and clothed in black as well, held her shaking shoulders, eventually pulling her away from the casket as it was escorted to the waiting hearse. The young man tried to comfort and support the woman as he led her to her own waiting limousine, where other family members were waiting, but she pushed him away. The limousine drove off, leaving the young man behind. The commander of the escort detail picked the flag up off the snow-covered ramp, quickly folded it, and gave it to one of the limousine attendants, as if unsure of what to do with it now. </p><p> The young man remained behind. He watched silently as the remaining sixteen caskets were escorted out of the big transport plane and placed into their hearses, and he remained, ignoring the snow falling heavier and heavier, after all the limousines, the escort detail, and the color guard had departed. None of the other family members spoke to the officials, and they did not attempt to speak with the family members. The officials returned to their limousines as soon as the last hearse drove away. </p><p> The young man saw he was not alone. A tall, distinguished-looking older gentleman, also in a black fur beaver-pelt hat and rich-looking sealskin coat, stood nearby, tears running unabashedly down his cheeks. They looked at each other across the snow-obscured ramp. The older man approached the younger and nodded politely. "<i>Spakoyniy nochyee, bratam</i>," he said in greeting. "<i>K sazhalyeneeyoo. Kak deela?</i>" </p><p> "I've been better," the younger man replied. He did not offer his hand in greeting. </p><p> "I'm sorry for your loss," the older man said. "I am Dr. Pyotr Viktorievich Fursenko. I lost my son, Gennadi Piotrievich, in Kosovo." </p><p> "I am sorry," the young man murmured. There was a glimmer of recognition in his eyes. </p><p> "Thank you. He was a lieutenant, one of the security officers. He had been in the army only eight months, and in Kosovo only two weeks." No other comment from the young man, so Fursenko went on: "I assume the unit commander, Colonel Kazakov, was your father?" The young man nodded. Dr. Fursenko paused, looked at the younger man, waiting for an introduction, but none was forthcoming. "And that was your mother, I assume?" Again, nothing. "I am sorry for her as well. I must tell you, I can't help but agree with her sentiments." </p><p> "Her sentiments?" </p><p> "Her anger at Russia, at the Central Military Committee, at the general state of our country in general," Fursenko said. "We can't seem to do anything right, even help our comrades hold on to a tiny republic in the backwaters of the Balkans." </p><p> The younger man glanced over at Fursenko. "How do you know I'm not an internal security officer or MVD, Doctor?" he asked. The MVD, or Ministry of Internal Affairs, conducted most government intelligence, counterintelligence, and national police activities inside the Russian Federation. "You could be investigated for what you just said." </p><p> "I don't care-let them investigate me, imprison me, kill me," Fursenko said, his voice filled with despair. "They are undoubtedly better at killing their own people than protecting their soldiers in Kosovo or Chechnya." The young man smiled at that comment. "My research center was torn down, my industry that I have worked in for twenty-five years has all but closed down, my parents are gone, my wife died a few years ago, and my two daughters are somewhere in North America. My son was all I had left." He paused, looking the younger man up and down. "I would say that you could be MVD or SVR as well." The SVR was the new name for the KGB, which conducted most foreign intelligence activities for Russia but was free to act inside the country as well. "Except I think you are dressed a little too well." </p><p> "You are a very observant man," the young man said. He regarded Fursenko for a moment, then extended a hand, and Fursenko accepted it. "Pavel Gregorievich Kazakov." </p><p> "Pleased to meet-" Fursenko stopped suddenly, then squinted his eyes. "Pavel Kazakov? The Pavel Kazakov?" </p><p> "I am very impressed by what you are doing at Metyor, Doctor Fursenko," Kazakov remarked, his voice deep and insistent, as if silently urging Fursenko not to dwell on what he had just figured out. </p><p> "I ... I ..." Fursenko took a moment to regain his composure, then went on "Thank you, sir. It is all due to you, of course." </p><p> "Not at all, Doctor," Kazakov said. "Metyor is a fine group." Most large privatized companies in the Commonwealth of Independent States belonged to organizations called IIGs, or Industrial Investment Groups, similar to corporations in the United States. IIG members were usually banks, other IIGs, some foreign investors, and a few wealthy individuals, but the primary member of any IIG was the Russian government, which controlled at least twenty percent but sometimes as much as ninety percent of any venture, and therefore had ultimate control. Metyor was one of the lucky ones: only thirty percent of the IIG was owned by the government. "And I am familiar with your old venture, the Soviet aircraft design bureau in Lithuania called Fisikous." </p><p> It was Fursenko's turn to look uncomfortable, which pleased and intrigued Kazakov. In conducting his due-diligence before investing in any new company, especially a troubled but high-tech concern like Metyor, Kazakov always put his extensive private intelligence operatives, most of them former KGB, to work learning all there was to learn about the previous holdings of the IIG, which in this case was a research and development institute called Fisikous. What he had found out was nothing short of astounding. </p><p> The Fisikous Institute of Technology had been an advanced aircraft and technology research facility in Vilnius, in what was then the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic, now the independent Republic of Lithuania on the eastern end of the Baltic Sea. Fisikous had been on the cutting edge of Soviet aircraft design, attracting the brightest engineers from all over the Soviet Union and the non-aligned nations. The big name at Fisikous had been a young scientist named Ivan Ozerov, who'd been the resident low observable technology-stealth-expert. No one knew anything about Ozerov, except that in a short time at Fisikous, under the direct supervision of the chief of the facility, Pyotr Fursenko, and another man who most suspected was KGB, he'd become the number-one design expert in all of the Soviet Union. Ozerov was brilliant, but weird and unpredictable, occasionally launching into wild tirades in English at the slightest provocation or agitation. Scientists there had long suspected Ozerov of being either on LSD or simply psychotic-he was far more than just eccentric. But there was no question that his work, especially on the incredible Fi-170 stealth bomber, had been nothing short of genius. </p><p> But there had been problems at Fisikous. The Baltic republic of Lithuania was driving toward independence from the Soviet Union, and Fisikous represented all that was bad about life under Soviet rule. Ivan Ozerov had disappeared during some kind of military action. Some said the American CIA or Special Forces had kidnapped Ozerov. Others said Ozerov had not been Russian but a captured American scientist, codenamed "Redtail Hawk," brainwashed right there at Fisikous by the KGB, and that the military action had really been a rescue mission. Even the Fisikous-170 stealth bomber, a one-hundred-and-twenty-thousand kilo warplane, had been stolen. </p><p> "When the Union collapsed, I went back to Russia to head up some other aerospace design bureaus," Fursenko went on. "I was going to retire or emigrate to the West, because the industry had all but disappeared in the Commonwealth. But when my wife died, I ... I stayed on ... well, mostly just to have something to do." </p><p> "I understand," Kazakov said sincerely. "I think that's important." "They had better <i>kofye</i> and <i>romavaya babas</i> in the labs than could afford as a pensioner anyway," Fursenko admitted with a faint smile. "There's not much money in Metyor, but we're doing important work, incredible things. I didn't mind not getting paid as long as I could keep on working and get real coffee. No offense, sir. It is rewarding work, but the pay is terrible." </p><p> "No offense taken. My mother made the best <i>romavaya babas</i> when I was a kid," Kazakov said. He sighed. "Now I think she would use a handful of them to choke me if she had the chance." </p><p> Fursenko didn't know what to say or do-he was afraid to smile, nod, or even move. He was very surprised and a bit wary after hearing the apparent warmth in Kazakov's voice-not something he had ever expected to hear at all. "I couldn't help but notice, your mother ... seemed rather upset at ... well ..." </p><p> "At me, yes," Kazakov admitted. "She does not approve of what I do." </p><p> "And at Russia also." </p><p> "She blames the Russian government for the sloppy way it supports our troops overseas," Kazakov said. "She blames me for everything else." </p><p> Fursenko definitely did not feel comfortable discussing this man's personal life-that was an area he had no desire whatsoever to explore. He extended his hand, and Kazakov took it warmly. "It was a pleasure to meet you, <i>Gaspadeen</i>-" Fursenko had used the more modern post-Union breakup, more "politically correct" term for "mister," but he automatically stopped himself, then said, "Tovarisch Kazakov." That was what most Russians had called each other back when there was a strong, fearsome, proud empire: Comrade. </p><p> Kazakov smiled and nodded approvingly. "My condolences for your loss, <i>Tovarisch</i> Fursenko." </p><p> "And to you, sir." Fursenko turned and quickly strode away, feeling very uncomfortable with that man knowing his name or even standing behind him. </p><p> Kazakov stood by himself on the ramp, reflecting on this very strange evening. First the death and return of his father in shame, without any honors; his mother's outburst and her rejection; and then this chance meeting with one of the Cold War's most famous and brilliant weapons designers. Pavel Gregorievich Kazakov didn't believe in fate-he wielded too much power to believe that anyone else decided your future-but there had to be a reason, some definite path, that this chain of events signaled. </p><p> At one time, Doctor Pyotr Viktorievich Fursenko had been considered the finest and most imaginative aerospace and electromagnetodynamics engineer in all of Europe. Since the age of thirty, he had been the director of several Soviet aircraft and weapon design bureaus, building the most advanced military aircraft, missiles, bombs, avionics, and components imaginable ... </p><p> At least, they had <i>thought</i> it was the best. Fursenko's word had been considered physics law until Ivan Ozerov had shown up at Fisikous. When Ozerov had started working at Fisikous, completely shattering the old beliefs and understandings, the Soviet scientists had realized exactly how far behind the United States they were on advanced warplane technology, especially low observable airframe, devices, systems, and counter-stealth technology. </p><p> This had only spurred Fursenko to even greater heights of genius. Even though the collapse of the Soviet Union meant the collapse of big, super-secret, well-funded agencies like Fisikous, it had also meant that Fursenko could travel and attend classes and seminars all over the world to learn more about modern warplane technology. When Ozerov had disappeared, probably back to whatever planetoid or genetic-engineering incubation tank had spawned him, Fursenko had again taken the lead in Russian aircraft and weapons design. </p><p> And now Kazakov knew where he was, had met him, and could even be called his boss-because Kazakov owned over sixty percent of Metyor Industrial Investment Group. The genius Fursenko had been at his disposal all this time, and he hadn't even know it! But how to take advantage of this development? His mind began racing.... </p><p> Only when the cargo ramp was finally raised and the transport plane made ready to be towed back to its hangar did Kazakov finally turn toward the three government vehicles behind him, which had also remained. </p><p> The middle and left side cars suddenly started up and drove off, leaving one car behind. A guard in a dark suit, wearing a machine pistol on a strap, emerged from the remaining vehicle, a stretch limousine, and opened a door for the young man. Kazakov brushed snow off his shoulders, then removed and brushed snow off his hat, revealing a shaved head, and stepped inside. The door closed behind the young man with a heavy CHUNK! that revealed its heavily armored doors and windows. The limousine drove off. </p><p> Inside was one man, a military officer in his early sixties, seated on a side-facing seat. Before him was a communications console, complete with satellite transceivers and television and computer monitors. A very pretty uniformed female aide sat in the forward aft-facing seat, with a similar console before her. She glanced at the young man, gave him an approving half-smile, and returned to her work. </p><p> "You did not even try to pay your respects to my mother, General," the young man said acidly,...</p></p><h2>The Art of the Cocktail: 100 Classic Cocktail Recipes</h2><p>"I drink to make other people interesting"<p>-- George Jean Nathan</p><p>Not so long ago, men drank martinis, women drank daiquiris, and no one knew what wine spritzers were.

Robert O&#39;Brien died in 1973.Occasionally, a book is better in print than on tape, no matter how expert the reader. Moore&#39;s youthful, androgynous voice is perfect for the teenaged diarist in O&#39;Brien&#39;s remarkable Doomsday novel. But the book, grimly fascinating on the page, reveals distracting weaknesses read aloud. Its formal prose (using no contractions) becomes awkward and stilted. And an important element--the narrator&#39;s gender is not revealed at first--is spoiled, not by the performance, but by the packaging; Christina Moore&#39;s name, and the cover illustration, give away the secret. Still, Moore&#39;s well-crafted performance and O&#39;Brien&#39;s moving, suspenseful story go far to make up for these flaws. This is good for car trips--the plot will enthrall adults, as well as teens. S.P.

Barney Pressman was a hard-working nobody who sold mostly second-hand clothing in a nowhere neighborhood in Manhattan. From those humble beginnings rose a store that became famous for the sheer volume of its suits, and the discount prices for which they were sold. But Barney Pressman's son, Fred, had a different vision. He wanted his store to be more upscale, even if it couldn't be uptown, like Bloomingdale's. He pulled that off, but his sons--Barney's grandsons--wanted even more. They envisioned a plush uptown store, franchised around the world, with no expenses spared. And so they spent $267 million on their Madison Avenue store--$600,000 alone for a hand-assembled marble-chip floor--sinking the three-generation family business in a mere 10 years.<p> Levine shapes this story less as a tragedy than a lesson in hubris--and in business. All of Barney and Fred Pressman's business savvy corrupted into snobbery when Fred's sons took over. Barneys became "too New Yorky for most New Yorkers." There's an old saying that no one goes broke underestimating the taste of Americans. The converse is that fortunes are easily lost going the opposite direction. Barneys may be the most fascinating proof of that adage in American history. <i>--Lou Schuler</i></p>Joshua Levine, a senior editor at <i>Forbes,</i> lives in New York City.

For this splendid collection of Casasola&#39;s work, the noted American author Pete Hamill has written a rich essay on the photographer and the Mexico he pictured so well.</p><p><b>Agustin Victor Casasola</b> (1874-1938) was born in Mexico City. By 1900, he had dedicated himself entirely to photography and was contracted as a freelance photographer for numerous newspapers in Mexico City.<br>Although not well known outside his native Mexico, Casasola (1874-1938) was one of the "early masters of photo-journalism," writes journalist and novelist Pete Hamill in his stirring and informative introduction to this unprecedented and invaluable collection of Casasola's powerful images of a country in violent transition. Little is known about Casasola himself--portrayed in one photograph hard at work in his darkroom with a pistol on his hip--except that he started out as a reporter, then, around 1900, switched from words to images just in time to masterfully document two cataclysmic events, the horrifically bloody Mexican Revolution and the world-altering Industrial Revolution. Casasola recorded it all, photographing rebel leaders Pancho Villa and Emiliano Zapata, federal troops, rebel soldiers and the <i>soldaderas</i> (courageous women who cared for and fought beside them), and the dead. Possessed of a preternatural sense of the telling moment, Casasola also captured scenes sharply emblematic of the dawn of modernity on the busy streets of postwar Mexico City. Bursting with richly toned, page-filling plates and illuminating commentary, this is a must-have volume for the crucial history Casasola so poignantly illustrates, his artistry, and his profound humanity. <i>Donna Seaman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

I have worked with entrepreneurs, executives, and professionals in industries such as real estate, financial services, retail sales, law, advertising, marketing, video games, and more. The techniques used to sell ideas in Hollywood not only work in other industries, they often work <i>better</i>.<br><br>As you already know, &#x201c;good in a room&#x201d; is a Hollywood term referring to creative people who excel at pitching in high-stakes meetings. I&#x2019;ve had&#x2013;literally&#x2013;thousands of these meetings. During my time as a studio executive at MGM, I had over three thousand pitch meetings where writers, directors, stars, and producers would try to persuade me to buy their ideas.<br><br>Most of the time, ideas are pitched poorly. However, there are some people who succeed all the time. Over a period of years, I paid attention to what worked and what didn&#x2019;t. I identified the techniques that were being used in all of the successful meetings&#x2013;regardless of who was pitching. I also found a considerable number of ways that the person pitching could break the deal, often without knowing it.<br><br>Many studio executives, or &#x201c;suits,&#x201d; have backgrounds in sales, marketing, or finance. My degree is in theatrical directing from Carnegie Mellon. So when I started hearing pitches, I wasn&#x2019;t just thinking about whether to say yes or no. I was seeing the meeting as a theatrical performance.<br><br>Unfortunately, most writers, like most people, do not have a comprehensive strategy to deliver a great performance. When the time comes to pitch in a high-stakes situation, even someone experienced can stumble and ruin a golden opportunity without a solid meeting technique.<br><br>When someone with a great idea doesn&#x2019;t present it effectively, it not only hurts them, but all of us as well. Why? Because mediocre ideas will get purchased and produced if superior ideas aren&#x2019;t pitched well enough.<br><br>The fact is that when it comes to making a buying decision, buyers can more easily evaluate the information on the surface, i.e., the pitch. It&#x2019;s harder to evaluate what&#x2019;s inside. As you know, this is true beyond Hollywood. In a grocery aisle, success is determined more by the design and copywriting on the packaging than by the quality of the product. In job interviews, hiring decisions tend to look past differences in work experience and focus on how the candidates perform in the room. My point is not that pitching is everything. Rather, it&#x2019;s that good products deserve good packaging and great ideas deserve a great pitch.<br><br>Even shy, awkward, introverted people can learn to pitch well. One of my highlights from MGM was when I found a new writer named Mike who was pitching a high school comedy with a unique angle. His script was great, but his pitch was a disaster. He didn&#x2019;t know how to handle the small talk, he pitched too soon and with way too much detail&#x2013;he broke the deal in a dozen different ways. Ordinarily I would just pass on his project, but I was frustrated with the quality of the movies we were making and I didn&#x2019;t want to send this great script back to the slush pile. So I coached Mike on how to perform in each stage of the meeting and told him exactly what to say when my boss asked, &#x201c;So, what&#x2019;s your project about?&#x201d;<br><br>The next day, Mike pitched his idea beautifully to my boss, and it sold right there in the meeting. Afterward, he told me that he&#x2019;d been staying on his brother&#x2019;s couch for the last three months and was preparing to move back in with his parents. With this one sale, his career was on an entirely new trajectory. And for me, in a job where so much of my time was spent surviving cutthroat politics and producing mediocre ideas, helping Mike succeed was really gratifying. I realized then that I wanted to focus on pitching, not production.<br><br>A year later, I left my executive job and started my own company, also called Good in a Room, to help writers and directors with quality ideas get the attention and financing they deserve. Then I did an interview with National Public Radio and I started getting some remarkable calls. A fashion designer wanted help bringing out his summer collection. A marketing exec wanted to get promoted to VP. A financial advisor wanted to find new clients and expand her business.<br><br>Soon enough, my non-Hollywood clients were landing million-dollar accounts, doubling their client rosters, launching successful small businesses, increasing their revenue, and getting promoted. Sure, some of my clients were skeptical at first. William, for example, was a sixty-something financial advisor from Texas. We met at the Merrill Lynch campus in New Jersey. I was there to give the concluding presentation at the annual conference for top producers.<br><br>William was already quite successful. He didn&#x2019;t need to change how he was doing business. As well, he was in a conservative business in a conservative part of the country, so anything that came out of a liberal place such as Hollywood was immediately suspect.<br><br>Still, he wanted to take his business to the next level, and he was smart enough to realize that unless he wanted to simply put in more hours and work harder, he was going to have to try something new. I consulted with him the next morning before we went to the airport and suggested that he modify his standard approach in a few significant ways. He was doubtful, but he said he&#x2019;d give it a shot when he got back to Texas.<br><br>When I landed in LA, William had already left me a message. Turns out the guy sitting next to him on the plane had just sold his business and needed a financial advisor he could trust. Rather than trying to &#x201c;sell&#x201d; him, as so many financial advisors do, my client practiced the Good in a Room techniques and signed him rather effortlessly.<br><br>Meeting a client on a plane is practically a clich� (though in reality, it doesn&#x2019;t happen very often), and all of the credit belongs to William. Still, the idea that a sixty-something financial advisor in conservative Texas could, with one consultation, master and successfully apply what works for thirty-something writers in liberal Los Angeles? Very cool.<br><br>Whether you work in Hollywood or not, the fact is that selling ideas is really difficult to do. The reason the pitching secrets of the most successful writers and directors are relevant is that these people have evolved an advanced method for selling ideas. <br><br>Whether you&#x2019;re a screenwriter, a journalist with an idea for a story, an entrepreneur with a business plan, an inventor with a blueprint, or a manager with an innovative solution, if you want other people to invest their time, energy, and money in your idea, you face an uphill battle.<br><br>First, ideas aren&#x2019;t tangible&#x2013;no one can kick the tires of your idea. Second, ideas aren&#x2019;t quantifiable&#x2013;the decision maker can&#x2019;t reliably estimate the value of your idea in monetary terms. As my boss at MGM used to say, &#x201c;If we knew which ideas would be hits, we would only make hits.&#x201d; Third, ideas are risky&#x2013;there can be millions of dollars on the line and reputations at stake when a buyer says yes to an idea. Fourth, people who buy ideas hear so many pitches that getting their attention and actually convincing them is exceptionally difficult. Finally, the more original your idea is, the tougher it is to pitch effectively. Any groundbreaking idea will be harder to sell simply because there isn&#x2019;t a precedent to show it will work.<br><br>As risks increase and buyers become more difficult to persuade, people who sell ideas must clear an even higher bar. We must get in the right rooms with the right people. We need a comprehensive strategy and the most advanced tactics. Then we can present ourselves and our ideas with confidence.</p><h2>Plumbing</h2><p>Plumbing Design and Installation provides comprehensive coverage of the plumbing trade including the design, installation, testing, and repair of plumbing systems in residential and commercial structures.

It was the year 1159 when the medieval Jewish traveler Benjamin left his native town of Tudela in northern Spain on an adventure to see the places he had read about in the Bible. He traveled for fourteen years - from Rome to Constantinople to Jerusalem to Baghdad, among others - by ship, by cart, and on foot, enduring great hardships in his quest for knowledge of other places and people.</p><p>Working from Benjamin's original chronicle, written in Hebrew, as well as other sources on the period, Uri Shulevitz captures the true spirit of this amazing adventurer, using a text written in the first person and superlative illustrations.</p><p><i>The Travels of Benjamin of Tudela</i> is a 2006 Bank Street - Best Children's Book of the Year.</p></p><p><p><b>Uri Shulevitz</b> is a Caldecott Medal-winning illustrator and author. He was born in Warsaw, Poland, on February 27, 1935. He began drawing at the age of three and, unlike many children, never stopped. The Warsaw blitz occurred when he was four years old, and the Shulevitz family fled. For eight years they were wanderers, arriving, eventually, in Paris in 1947. There Shulevitz developed an enthusiasm for French comic books, and soon he and a friend started making their own. At thirteen, Shulevitz won first prize in an all-elementary-school drawing competition in Paris's 20th district. </p><p>In 1949, the family moved to Israel, where Shulevitz worked a variety of jobs: an apprentice at a rubber-stamp shop, a carpenter, and a dog-license clerk at Tel Aviv City Hall. He studied at the Teachers' Institute in Tel Aviv, where he took courses in literature, anatomy, and biology, and also studied at the Art Institute of Tel Aviv. At fifteen, he was the youngest to exhibit in a group drawing show at the Tel Aviv Museum. </p><p>At 24 he moved to New York City, where he studied painting at Brooklyn Museum Art School and drew illustrations for a publisher of Hebrew books. One day while talking on the telephone, he noticed that his doodles had a fresh and spontaneous look&#x2015;different from his previous illustrations. This discovery was the beginning of Uri's new approach to his illustrations for <i>The Moon in My Room</i>, his first book, published in 1963. Since then he was written and illustrated many celebrated children's books. He won the Caldecott Medal for <i>The Fool of the World</i> <i>and the Flying Ship</i>, written by Arthur Ransome. He has also earned three Caldecott Honors, for <i>The Treasure</i>, <i>Snow</i> and <i>How I Learned Geography</i>. His other books include <i>One Monday Morning</i>, <i>Dawn</i>, <i>So Sleepy Story</i>,and many others. He also wrote the instructional guide <i>Writing with Pictures: How to Write and Illustrate Children's Books</i>. He lives in New York City.</p>*Starred Review* Gr. 4-7. At first blush, the story of a bona fide twelfth-century Jewish wanderer might not seem the stuff of picture books, even for older readers. But this is so uniquely rendered that it proves, along with other recently published titles, that outstanding execution can draw readers to almost any subject. This fictional account follows Benjamin on a 14-year trip, which takes him from his home in Spain to historic cities of the ancient world: Rome, Babylon, Baghdad, and Jerusalem, among others. Illness, hunger, thirst, thieves, and assassins plague the journey. Yet there are also wonderful adventures, mystical stories, and fabulous sights, such as the pyramids. Told in an expansive first-person narrative, the book is filled with a bazaar's worth of detail, with unobtrusive sidebars explaining text references. In an extensive author's note, Shulevitz discusses how, beginning with Benjamin's actual diary in the original Hebrew, he faced the task of making the mostly factual reporting appealing by adding incidents found in other books. An extensive bibliography lists his sources, but, unfortunately, there are no specifics about the experiences he took from them. It's no surprise that Shulevitz, a Caldecott winner, provides splendid illustrations, but he outdoes himself here. The richly painted scenes, which vary in style and color according to their location, are highlighted by collage accents. Together with the evocative text, they capture the sweep of mysterious and faraway places.

The middle son comes by a fine riding horse, and Per, the youngest, receives a handsomely carved and painted Dala horse. Though his brothers laugh, Per guesses that his horse will prove useful. And when the trolls of the underworld work their mischief, neither the workhorse nor the riding horse can compare with Per&#39;s magnificent Dala horse.</p><p>Rebecca Hickox is the author of &#34;The Golden Sandal: A Middle-Eastern Cinderella Story,&#34; &#34;Zorro and Quwi,&#34; and &#34;Matreshka,&#34; as well as &#34;Per and the Dala Horse.&#34; She is currently working on a sequel to &#34;Per and the Dala Horse,&#34; called &#34;The Troll&#39;s Wedding,&#34; also in collaboration with illustrator Yvonne Gilbert. &#34;The Troll&#39;s Wedding&#34; will be published by Skandisk, Inc. in 2006.PreSchool-Grade 3?Upon their father's death, three brothers inherit different gifts. The eldest receives the farm, workhorse, and plow; the second, a fine horse; and the youngest a dala horse?a hand-carved, brightly painted wooden toy. Although the older young men scoff at Per's gift, he maintains that it might be useful some day. Indeed, when trolls steal the gold communion cup from the priest's house, it is Per who, with the help of the wooden horse, outwits them. With his reward, he buys a farm and, later, gives the scratched toy to his youngest son. The vigorous text seamlessly incorporates elements of Swedish folklore. The colored-pencil illustrations are similar in style to Jan Brett's work, including borders and decorative detail, but with a pastel palette; a lighter, sketchier line; and more sense of movement. The blues, tans, and reds effectively evoke the setting, as do the details such as carved, decorated furniture; painted pottery; and embroidered and appliqued clothing. The borders extend the illustrations by depicting the farm, mountains, bewreathed horses, and trolls in pugnacious postures. Large white spaces frame the blocks of text, and the balanced composition effectively draws the eye to relevant characters or actions. Suitable for storytelling or independent reading.?Cynthia K.

Basically, they should be read by everyone! Mary Stewart&#39;s research for these books is phenomenal. Her understanding of myth and its relationship to fact is remarkable. The books are complex, yet incredibly inviting and you will absolutely love the characters. They also weave together so beautifully that you won&#39;t be able to read only one. Two things I find particularly interesting in this series is the portrayal of Arthur and the fall of Camelot. Arthur represents all of humanity in these books as opposed to the more mythical figure you usually see. And the fall of Camelot is more internal rather than external--more about the passions and lusts in the heart rather than a more obvious loss of power. The books go in this order: The Crystal Cave, The Hollow Hills, The Last Enchantment, The Wicked Day.

This fourth book (after Gone, No Forwarding ) in his series about Daniel Kearney Associates, a San Francisco private investigation firm specializing in auto repossession, displays his skill in managing a large cast and a variety of subplots; Gores's own experiences in a firm very much like DKA lend an air of verisimilitude to the often-hilarious goings-on. As the King of the Gypsies lies near death after a fall, San Francisco gypsies defraud Bay Area Cadillac dealers out of 31 vehicles in a single day. The meat of the story concerns the recovery of these cars plus a 32nd Cadillac, a pink 1958 convertible in which the king has said he would like to be buried. Gores provides lots of authentic gypsy lore and often induces readers to cheer the bad guys, since, like all successful con artists, the gypsies prey on their victims' venality and stupidity. Good fun all around, capped by a neat, unexpected ending. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.Third-person narration marks Gores's addition to the "Dan Kearney Associates" series. Kearney's car repossessors run the gamut from beautiful and female to muscular and inarticulate, but they prove their merit by matching wits with Gypsies bent on "appropriating" 32 new Cadillacs and one prize 1958 convertible. Rapid scene and character shifts move the action from bustling San Francisco to bucolic Steubenville, where the current Gypsy king lies dying. Picturesque scams make for continuous humor and slick prose.

It is also the first of the final three such collections, since Dr. Gould has announced that the series will end with the turn of the millennium.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>In this collection, Gould consciously and unconventionally formulates a humanistic natural history, a consideration of how humans have learned to study and understand nature, rather than a history of nature itself. With his customary brilliance, Gould examines the puzzles and paradoxes great and small that build nature's and humanity's diversity and order. In affecting short biographies, he depicts how scholars grapple with problems of science and philosophy as he illuminates the interaction of the outer world with the unique human ability to struggle to understand the whys and wherefores of existence.</p><p>One of this century's most thoughtful and prolific naturalists, Harvard professor Stephen Jay Gould looks at the human twists on science in his eighth series of essays taken from <i>Natural History</i> magazine. As only he can, Gould finds questions where others have never looked, and answers where others have been blinded--by their professional rivalries, by their unacknowledged privilege in society, by the dominant world-view at their particular juncture in history. "All great science," he says in the title essay, "indeed all fruitful thinking, must occur in a social and intellectual context--and contexts are just as likely to promote insight as to constrain thought." Gould's gift is being able to identify context, and see patterns in diverse fields or people or moments in history in a way that Darwin saw patterns in living species. <p> This book is less about clams, worms, and Leonardo than about some evolutionary dead ends in human intellectual history. It's not an easy read. Those who are already Gould fans will find more tantalizing tidbits--no, thick stew--from this fruitful author. Those first-timers drawn by an intriguing title will scratch, frown, fall asleep, swear, and generally want to give up. But don't! Gould is one of those authors that takes some getting used to. With a little patience, his extravagant prose will edify rather than trip you, and his digressions will delight rather than distract. <i>--Lauran Cole Warner</i></p>Praise for Questioning the Millennium<br><br>"Gould poses three questions about the millennium in this delicious science-historical jeu d'esprit. . . . [This] may be the most enjoyable millennium book of the second millennium."<br>--Booklist<br><br>"With a humorous Everyman approach, Gould juggles a mind-boggling array of various calendrical concepts as he explains why creating a reliable calendar was one of man's greatest struggles. Whether nailing down the precise date of the birth of Christ or airing his suspicion that God is a New York Yankees fan, Gould teaches rather than preaches."<br>--Entertainment Weekly<br><br>Praise for Full House<br><br>"Bacteria and baseball. Few authors besides Stephen Jay Gould could write convincingly about both. . . . Wandering about [Full House's] well-decorated rooms, nooks, and attics is a pleasure left to the reader."<br>--Washington Post Book World<br><br>"A tour de force of scientific reasoning, one that puts evolution in an astonishing new light."<br>--Wall Street Journal<br><br>"A veteran intellectual daredevil, Gould climbs further out on a thought-limb than ever before in his paradigm-shattering book. . . . Gould elegantly lays down a gauntlet here, and readers should rush to witness the first thrust in what may become a royal scientific duel."<br>--Publishers Weekly (starred review)<br><br>Praise for Dinosaur in a Haystack<br><br>"[Gould] writes in a consistently graceful, approachable style, with easy elegance and clarity, and he is an incomparable explainer of difficult ideas."<br>--New York Times Book Review<br><br>"Passionate, eloquent. His is an unintimidating, entertaining, and masterful technique."<br>--San Francisco Chronicle</p><h2>Eros and Civilization</h2><p>New copy. Fast shipping.

He is the author of the Prey novels, the Kidd novels, the Virgil Flowers novels, <em>The Night Crew</em>, and<em> Dead Watc</em>h. He lives in New Mexico.For those who thought computers were only for nonviolent geeks, John Sandford's THE DEVIL'S CODE certainly dispels that notion. The thriller, a high-tech suspense novel in which superior intelligence defeats money and power, is augmented by Frank Muller's flawless narration. When Jack Morrison is shot to death in what looks like a burglary gone bad, his sister Lane and friend Kidd, have reason to believe otherwise and begin to investigate. Kidd and Lane uncover a widespread conspiracy involving Anmath, Morrison's employer, and an array of government bureaucrats. Despite being outmanned, Kidd, Lane, and their band of computer geeks and hackers eventually succeed in revealing the conspiracy and confirming that Jack's death was not as it seemed. Muller is particularly effective in distinguishing the voices and personalities of the characters, and gives each scene the drama it deserves.

Pearson lives with his wife and two daughters, dividing their time between Missouri and Idaho.The Rock Bottom Remainders, a group of celebrated writers smitten with rock 'n' roll glamour, gladly submitted when independent publicist Kathi Karmen Goldmark conceived the idea of forming a literary rock band to perform at the 1992 American Booksellers Association convention in Anaheim. The band members--including Dave Barry, Matt Groening, Stephen King, Barbara Kingsolver and Amy Tan--had so much fun with that gig that they decided to take their show on the road, playing clubs from Boston to Miami on a jaunt financed by the advance on this book. Each writer/rocker contributed an article on "what being in a band has meant to me." Their various musings, ranging from the comic to the portentous, straddle the line between the charming and the pompous. The Remainders lapse at times into cliches and stereotypes--i.e., that "real" rockers are illiterate--which make them sound like frat boys and sorority sisters slumming. But even if this project is nakedly self-indulgent, for the most part it is self-aware. And Barry's and Groening's reflections are better than that--hilarious. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>To War With Whitaker</h2><p>1998 Arrow Trade PB.

Her earlier works include Postmortemthe only novel to win five major crime awards in a single yearand Cruel and Unusual, which won Britains prestigious Gold Dagger Award for the best crime novel of 1993. Dr. Kay Scarpetta herself won the 1999 Sherlock Award for the best detective created by an American author.<b>ONE</b><p>Win Garano sets two lattes on a picnic table in front of the John F. Kennedy School of Government. It's a sunny afternoon, mid-May, and Harvard Square is crowded. He straddles a bench, overdressed and sweaty in a black Armani suit and black patent-leather Prada shoes, pretty sure the original owner of them is dead. </p><p>He got a feeling about it when the saleslady in the Hand-Me-Ups shop said he could have the "gently worn" outfit for ninety-nine dollars. Next she pulled out suits, shoes, belts, ties, even socks. DKNY, Hugo Boss, Gucci, Hermes, Ralph Lauren. All from the same <i>celebrity whose name I can't tell you</i>, and it occurred to Win that not so long ago, a wide receiver for the Patriots got killed in a car wreck. One eighty, six feet tall, muscular but not a moose. In other words, Win's size. </p><p>He sits alone at the picnic table, more self-conscious by the moment. Students, faculty, the elite-most of them in jeans, shorts, carrying knapsacks-cluster at other tables deep in conversations that include very few comments about the dull lecture District Attorney Monique Lamont just gave at the Forum. <i>No Neighbor Left Behind</i>. Win warned her it was a confusing title, not to mention a banal topic for such a prestigious political venue. She's not going to appreciate that he was right. He doesn't appreciate that she ordered him here on his day off so she could boss him around, belittle him. Make a note of this. Make a note of that. Call so and so. Get her a coffee. Starbucks. Latte with skim milk and Splenda. Wait for her outside in the heat while she hobnobs inside the air-conditioned Littauer Center. </p><p>He sullenly watches her emerge from the brick building escorted by two plainclothes officers from Massachusetts State Police, where Win is a homicide detective currently assigned to the Middlesex County District Attorney's detective unit. In other words, assigned to Lamont, who called him at home last night and said effective immediately he's on leave from his regular duties. <i>I'll explain after my lecture at the Forum. See you at two.</i> No further details. </p><p>She pauses to give an interview to the local ABC affiliate, then to NPR. She talks with reporters from <i>The Boston Globe</i> the AP, and that Harvard student, Cal Tradd, who writes for the <i>Crimson</i>, thinks he's from <i>The Washington Post</i>. The presses loves Lamont. The press loves to hate her. No one is indifferent to the powerful, beautiful DA-today, conspicuous in a bright green suit. Escada. This year's spring collection. Seems she's been on quite the shopping spree of late, a new outfit practically every time Win sees her. </p><p>She continues talking to Cal as she walks confidently across the brick plaza, past massive planters of azaleas, rhodendrons, and pink and white dogwoods. Blond, blue-eyed, pretty-boy Cal, so cool and collected, so sure of himself, never flustered, never frowns, always so damn pleasant. Says something while scribbling on his notepad, and Lamont nods, and he says something else, and she keeps nodding. Win wishes the guy would do something stupid, get himself kicked out of Harvard. Flunking out would be even better. What a friggin' pest. </p><p>Lamont dismisses Cal, signals for her plainclothes protection to give her privacy, and sits across from Win, her eyes hidden by reflective gray-tinted glasses. </p><p>"I thought it went well." She picks up her latte without thanking him for it. </p><p>"Not much of a turnout. But you seemed to make your point." He says. </p><p>"Obviously, most people, including you, don't grasp the enormity of the problem." That flat tone she uses when her narcissism has been insulted. "The decline of the neighborhoods is potentially as destructive as global warming. Citizens have no respect for law enforcement, no interest whatsoever in helping us or each other. This past weekend I was in New York, walking through Central Park, and noticed a backpack abandoned on a bench. Do you think a single person thought to call the police? Maybe consider there could be an explosive device inside it? No. Everyone just kept going, figuring if it blew up, it wasn't their problem as long as they didn't get hurt, I suppose." </p><p>"The world is going to hell, Monique." </p><p>"People have slipped into complacency, and here's what we're going to do about it," she says. "I've set the stage. Now we create the drama." </p><p>Every day with Lamont is drama. </p><p>She toys with her latte, looks around to see who's looking at her. "How do we attention? How do we take people who are jaded, desensitized, and make them care about crime? Care so much they decide to get involved at a grass-roots level? Can't be gangs, drugs, carjackings, robberies, burglaries. Why? Because people want a crime problem that's, let's be honest,' front-page news but happens to others, not to them." </p>"I wasn't aware people actually want a crime problem." He notices a skinny young woman with kinky red hair loitering near a Japanese maple not far from them. Dressed like Raggedy Ann, right down to her striped stockings and clunky shoes. Saw her the other week, in downtown Cambridge, loitering around the courthouse, probably some petty crime like shoplifting. <p>"An unsolved sexual homicide," Lamont is saying. "April fourth, 1962, Watertown." </p><p>"I see. Not a cold case this time but a frozen one," he says, keeping his eye on Raggedy Ann. "I'm surprised you even know where Watertown is." </p><p>In Middlesex County, her jurisdiction-along with some sixty other modest municipalities she doesn't give a damn about. </p><p>"Four square miles, population thirty-five thousand, very diverse ethnic base," she says. "The perfect crime that just so happens to have been committed in the perfect microcosm for my initiative. The chief will partner you up with his lead detective&amp; You know, the one who drives that monstrous scene truck. Oh, what is it the call her? </p><p>'"Stump." </p><p>"That's right. Because she's short and fat." </p><p>"She has a prosthesis, a below-the-knee amputation," he says. </p><p>"Cops can be so insensitive. I believe the two of you know each other, from the little grocery store around the corner from where she works a second job. So that's a good start. Helps to be friends with someone you're going to spend a lot of time with." </p><p>"It's an upscale gourmet shop, and it isn't just a second job, and we're not friends." </p><p>"You sound defensive. The two of you go out, maybe not get along? Because that could be a problem." </p><p>"Nothing personal between us, never even worked a case with her," Win says. "But I think you have, since Watertown has plenty of crime and she's been around as long as you have." </p><p>"Why? Has she talked about me." </p><p>"Usually we talk about cheese." </p><p>Lamont glances at her watch. "Let's go to the facts of the case. Janie Brolin."</p><p>"Never heard of her." </p><p>"British. She was blind, decided to spend a year in the States, chose Watertown, most likely because of Perkins, probably the most famous school for the blind in the world. Where Helen Keller went." </p><p>"Perkins wasn't located in Watertown back in the Helen Keller days. It was in Boston." </p><p>"And why would you know trivia like that?" </p><p>"Because I'm a trivial person. And obviously you've been planning this <i>drama</i> for a while. So why did you wait until the last minute to tell me about it?"</p><p>"This is very sensitive and must be handled very discreetly. Imagine being blind and realizing there's an intruder inside your apartment. That horror factor and something far more important. I think you're going to discover she very well may have been the Boston Strangler's first victim. </p><p>"You said early April 1962?" Win frowns. "His alleged first murder wasn't until two months later, in June." </p><p>"Doesn't mean he hadn't killed before, just that earlier cases weren't linked to him." </p><p>"How do you propose we prove the Janie Brolin murder-or the Strangler's other thirteen alleged murders, for that matter-was committed by him, when we still don't know who he was?" </p><p>"We have Alberto DeSalvo's DNA." </p><p>"No one's ever proved he was the Strangler, and more to the point, do we have DNA from the Janie Brolin as for comparison?" </p><p>"That's for you to find out." </p><p>He can tell by her demeanor there's no DNA and she damn well knows it. Why would there be, some forty-five years later? Back then, there was no such thing as forensic DNA or even a thought that there might be someday. So forget proving or disproving anything, as far as he's concerned. </p><p>"It's never too late for justice," Lamont pontificates-or Lamonticates, as he calls it. "It's time to unite citizens and police in fighting crime. To take back our neighborhoods, not just here but worldwide. "We're going to create a model that will be studied everywhere." </p><p>Raggedy Ann is sending text messages on her cell phone. What a whack job. Harvard Square's full of them. The other day, Win say some guy licking the sidewalk in front of the Coop. </p><p>"Obviously, nothing about this to the press until the case is solved. Then, of course, it comes from me. It's too hot for May," she complains, getting up from the picnic table. Watertown tomorrow morning, ten sharp, the chief's office." </p><p>She leaves her barely touched latte for him to dutifully toss in the trash. </p><p></p><p></p></p><h2>Aquavit: And the New Scandinavian Cuisine</h2><p>An award-winning chef offers an innovative collection of recipes that emphasize the best in Scandinavian cuisine, including such unique dishes as Gravlax with Mustard Sauce, Swedish Roast Chicken with Spiced Apples, and Fois Gras Ganache, all tested for the home kitchen and accompanied by full-color photographs.</p><p>What kind of food would a French-trained Manhattan chef, born in Ethiopia and raised in Sweden, produce? The unique food of Aquavit, the Scandinavian restaurant whose refined, contemporary cooking Marcus Samuelsson presents in his eponymous debut cookbook. Samulesson's cuisine reflects the Swedish love of seafood, game, and pickled and preserved dishes, enlivened by Indian spices (brought to Sweden in the 17th century), plus other approaches. Thus <i>Aquavit</i> offers reborn Scandinavian favorites like Gravlax with Mustard Sauce and Swedish Roast Chicken with Spiced Apple Rice plus delights like Tandoori-Smoked Salmon with Goat Cheese Parfait, Hot-Smoked Char with Lemon Broth, and Glazed Salmon with Wasabi Sabayon. Though the book includes among its 150-plus recipes fare that's definitely friendly to the home cook--like Barbecued Boneless "Ribs" (made with boneless pork shoulder) and Slow Roasted Turkey Wings--this is fundamentally a chef's collection, and will probably be pored through more readily than cooked from. Nonetheless, for readers interested in the food of singular talent, presented in an oversized format as lovely as the cooking itself, the <i>Aquavit</i> is essential.<p> Chapters cover the basic menu stops, including soups, salads and sides, plus the likes of Steamed Crab Rolls from "Bites, Snacks and Little Plates"; Blueberry Bread from "Crackers and Breads"; and Lamb Sausage Wrap from "Sandwiches." Chapters on dessert offer such treats as Swedish Pancakes with Lingonberry Whipped Cream and Chocolate "Blini"; and a drinks section includes the unusual and very palatable likes of Lemon, Pepper, and Dill Aquavit and Yellow Mary Mix, a yellow-tomato bloody mary descendant. Illustrated with ravishing color photos that reiterate the sleek pleasures of the food, <i>Aquavit</i> is as special as its innovative and very worldly author. <i>--Arthur Boehm</i></p>Marcus Samuelsson is the executive chef and co-owner of Restaurant Aquavit, located in New York City and Minneapolis. Under his direction, Aquavit has repeatedly received the New York Times&#x2019;s coveted three-star rating. Samuelsson was named &#x201c;Rising Star Chef&#x201d; by the James Beard Foundation and has been featured in hundreds of publications around the world.</p><h2>A Short Guide to Praying as a Family: Growing Together in Faith and Love Each Day</h2><p>Praying together not only enriches family life but also leads the Catholic family toward its primary goal: the holiness and salvation of each member.<br><br> This wonderful little book provides a simple and easy-to-implement plan for family prayer.

He didn&#x2019;t mean to hurt anyone, he didn&#x2019;t mean to unlock his destiny, and he certainly didn&#x2019;t mean to see the shadows. But that is exactly what happened. Life often came at Will while he was focused on something else.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Since Will was twelve and nearly five feet tall, his parents thought he had outgrown riding the donkey they had rented for his brother Leo&#x2019;s birthday.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Aren&#x2019;t you a little old for a donkey ride, Will? It&#x2019;s for the kids. C&#x2019;mon,&#x201d; Deborah Wilder said, playfully mussing his spiky black hair in their sweltering backyard. She had a thin face like Will&#x2019;s, full lips, and blue-purple eyes that even the hardest of hearts could not resist for long. It was no wonder her TV show, Supernatural Secrets, had so many fans. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re getting so big, the donkey could ride you! Why don&#x2019;t you and your friends go finish that catapult thing you&#x2019;ve been working on?&#x201d; She gave him a quick one-armed hug and made her way back toward the party guests.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Mom, please, just one time around the yard--or maybe down the block,&#x201d; Will begged.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;No, you&#x2019;ll kill it, you big ox!&#x201d; she said over her shoulder with a smirk. Deborah swept back her straight brown hair and bent down to fix Will&#x2019;s six-year-old sister Marin&#x2019;s pink dress.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;So now donkey rides have age restrictions?&#x201d; Will yelled after her. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t know that, Mom! Is there a height limit too?&#x201d; But Deborah Wilder paid him no attention. She had already mingled back into the crush of family, children, and neighbors in the fun part of the yard.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Marin stuck her tiny pink tongue out at Will, both hands on her hips. &#x201c;Follow the rules, mithter. Follow the rules,&#x201d; she scolded with a lisp before cartwheeling away.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Sulking in defeat, Will shuffled back toward his three friends, two boys and a girl, who were watching closely from the fence at the rear of the yard. Since when am I too big? Will believed he had at least another year, maybe two, before he would officially outgrow amusements like donkey rides. He knew he had to let them go eventually. But not now--especially when money and prestige were on the line.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Strike one, Will-man,&#x201d; Andrew Stout, a massive kid with blazing red hair, and one of Will&#x2019;s closest friends, bellowed. &#x201c;Where&#x2019;s my five dollars?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not finished yet,&#x201d; Will said.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, no. You&#x2019;re finished. I said you couldn&#x2019;t get on the donkey, and you ain&#x2019;t on the donkey. So pay up. If you want to try again, it&#x2019;ll be double or nothing.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Can we check the law on this?&#x201d; interrupted a rail-thin boy with eyes that looked like black BBs behind his rectangular glasses. Simon Blabbingdale lightly poked Andrew&#x2019;s side with one of the thick paperbacks he always seemed to be carrying. &#x201c;Is it legal for Sheriff Stout&#x2019;s adolescent son to bet on ponies at a birthday party?&#x201d; Simon unleashed a series of high-pitched snorts, which he considered laughter. Nobody joined him. Simon and Will had been friends since the first grade. When no one in the cafeteria would sit next to the scrawny, curly-haired kid with glasses, Will did.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Can it, Simon.&#x201d; Andrew flicked the paperback from his ribs and focused on Will. &#x201c;We made a deal, Will-man, so pay up. I need the money for our trip.&#x201d; The big kid extended his open palm.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Wilders had invited Andrew and Simon to join them in Florida at the National Pee-Wee Karate Championships. Leo, an accomplished brown belt, was to compete at the tournament in two weeks&#x2019; time. Will and his friends would tag along for moral support and hit a few amusement parks between matches.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;What if I told you that I just came up with a new way to get on the donkey?&#x201d; Will mysteriously threw out, his hands clasped behind his back.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s see it. Double or nothing,&#x201d; Andrew said.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Camilla Meriwether, a girl with wide green eyes, a long chestnut-colored ponytail, and braces, rapped her knuckles on the fence behind her. &#x201c;Guys. Can we please try to act a little more mature? I mean, it&#x2019;s embarrassing. If Will&#x2019;s parents don&#x2019;t want him riding the donkey, why can&#x2019;t we just have some cake and enjoy the party?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Andrew and Will eyeballed each other, then in unison turned to Cami. &#x201c;Uh, no.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Cami was the only girl Will spoke to in his entire class. She was kind, sort of cute, and always spoke her mind--even if he rarely listened to her. &#x201c;Okay, well, while you little guys play your cowboy games, I&#x2019;m going to get some punch.&#x201d; She marched over to one of the refreshment tables.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When Cami was out ofearshot, Andrew spoke up. &#x201c;All right, get onto the donkey&#x2019;s back, I&#x2019;ll give you ten bucks. If you don&#x2019;t, you have to pay up. Deal?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Will furrowed his brow and got in Andrew&#x2019;s face. &#x201c;Deal.&#x201d; They shook on it and Will started to leave, but a swift tap on the arm from Simon stopped him.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I was thinking, as long as everybody&#x2019;s making wagers,&#x201d; Simon said, looking over the top of his glasses, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll buy you the first souvenir of our trip--no more than five dollars--if you race the donkey around the yard. You can&#x2019;t just ride it. I&#x2019;m talking a full gallop. If there&#x2019;s no gallop, you pick up the souvenir.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Will considered the offer for barely a second. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to be ten dollars richer and score a free souvenir. You&#x2019;re on too.&#x201d; He shot the boys a crooked smile, then ran off to appeal the donkey ban to the authority of last resort.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Dan Wilder, Will&#x2019;s father, with his tortoiseshell glasses and blue apron, stood at the barbecue pit on the deck methodically tending his perfectly spaced burgers. He laid them out like houses on a map at one of his city planning meetings. Dan Wilder was an architect, a city councilman, and a planner for the town of Perilous Falls. He had a refined sense of order even when it came to grilling--patties were restricted to the lower grill, veggies on the top.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As dads went, Dan was a handsome one. He had a strong, square jaw, and aside from three slight scars on the left side of his face, Dan could have been on the cover of any grocery checkout aisle magazine. A dad of few words, he usually kept to himself, attentively watching while others chattered on. Indeed, he had overheard Will&#x2019;s donkey pleas all day by the time the boy made his approach.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Dad, I was wondering . . .&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Without looking up from the smoldering patty at the end of his spatula, Mr. Wilder announced, &#x201c;The answer . . . son . . . is no.&#x201d; Then, brightening, he added, &#x201c;Do you want a burger?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Unless it can ride me around the yard, no thanks.&#x201d; Will stalked away in a huff to plot his next move.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He climbed onto a picnic table close to his house and studied the landscape like a general planning an invasion. How to get on that donkey?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>On the opposite side of his yard stood the squinty-eyed, mustached Heinrich Crinshaw. The Wilders&#x2019; bow-tied next-door neighbor was chairman of the Perilous Falls City Council and a constant if disagreeable presence at family events. On the surface Mr. Crinshaw seemed a refined gentleman, even warm.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Until he opened his mouth.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In a flat drone, he advised the neighborhood kids to stay on the Wilders&#x2019; side of the fence, worried that they might leap into his garden and ruin the rare flowers and herbs he spent thousands of dollars maintaining.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s nothing over there for you,&#x201d; he croaked to the kids when their parents were out of earshot. Then, bending down to their level, with a smile he added, &#x201c;Though my dog, Suzy, might like to see you all. She so enjoys children. She ate two last year--bones and all.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Mr. Crinshaw turned away as a couple of the little girls immediately burst into tears.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Will spied Aunt Freda, Deborah Wilder&#x2019;s blond relative, who had made herself snack guardian. Looking like an albino elephant caught in a kelly-green bedsheet, Freda jealously protected the table from approaching guests, gobbling cheese squares and chips as she made her way toward the cake at the other end of the table.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Across from Aunt Freda, near the drink station, Mayor Ava Lynch held a circle of parents spellbound. Her red suit and helmet of hard black hair seemed out of place at a backyard summer party. With the help of some sort of greasy youth cream, her skeletal face was quite animated that day. &#x201c;No, no . . . this city has got to move beyond the shackles of its history or we will never grow,&#x201d; she brayed, as if giving a campaign speech. At nearly seventy years old, the mayor&#x2019;s booming voice could still fill a yard, even reaching Will. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s why I decided to cancel this year&#x2019;s Jacob Wilder Day celebrations. The world is changing, and it is high time Perilous Fallsevolves with it. We can&#x2019;t pretend we&#x2019;re in the era of Jacob Wilder anymore,&#x201d; she said, chuckling.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Will saw his great-aunt Lucille Wilder&#x2019;s face flush with color at the mention of Jacob Wilder. Fireworks were coming. The compact woman with strawberry-blond hair spun on her heels to face the mayor.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Who are you to cancel a forty-five-year tradition?&#x201d; Aunt Lucille asked in a sharp voice, her curls trembling as if to emphasize the point. &#x201c;My father gave his life for this town, and I&#x2019;ll be stewed if you are going to stamp out his memory. Find another punching bag for your campaign, Ava--preferably someone living. You should all remember,there would be no Perilous Falls were it not for my father, Jacob Wilder.&#x201d; Those watching the little woman with fire in her arresting blue eyes fell silent.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, Lucille. You have to admit that your father&#x2019;s superstitious tales were wearing thin even when we were children. All that devil stuff . . .&#x201d; Mayor Lynch laughed, trying to win over the crowd. &#x201c;I know that your father founded the town--and it is wonderful that you run his little museum, bless your heart--but those antique trinkets and allyour daddy&#x2019;s stories won&#x2019;t make a safe and prosperous future for Perilous Falls. We&#x2019;re in the twenty-first century now, honey. People no longer believe the things our parents did. And we just don&#x2019;t have the resources to celebrate old fables, or even the one who created them.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The red hue of Aunt Lucille&#x2019;s face clashed with the powder-blue silk pantsuit she wore. Like loose pajamas, the material swallowed up Lucille&#x2019;s trim frame--but not her hands, which had balled into fists.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Your eyes see nothing, Ava, dear. They never did. My father was a visionary who had courage and virtues you&#x2019;ve never possessed. If you don&#x2019;t agree with his beliefs, or his warnings, say so. But don&#x2019;t disparage a man you never knew. Without my family, you might still be seating customers at Belle&#x2019;s Lounge.&#x201d; Lucille stared holes into the mayor. &#x201c;My grandfather Abe opened his first iron ore mine here when it was nothing but wilderness. My father tamed that wilderness with a purpose. He established schools and churches, and the city hall that you profane. He always said Perilous Falls was to be the last stronghold against the dark madness of the world. Our faith and our traditions are what sustain this town, Ms. Mayor. It is who we are. It is who we will always be. That is the legacy of Jacob Wilder, and I will celebrate him with or without mayoral approval. Now, if you&#x2019;ll excuse me.&#x201d; Aunt Lucille turned a withering glance on the mayor and bolted toward the house.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Poor woman&#x2019;s lost her mind,&#x201d; Mayor Lynch whispered to those nearest her.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Though in her sixty-sixth year, Aunt Lucille looked far younger as she strode across the yard with the ease and grace of a powerful dancer. She stopped next to Will&#x2019;s mom, throwing an arm dramatically on her shoulder.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Deb, dear, I totally forgot that I have a physical therapy session today,&#x201d; Aunt Lucille said. &#x201c;I left my gift for Leo on the kitchen table. Tell him I want to see his new karate moves and take him out on the boat one day this week, just him and me.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Did Ava say something?&#x201d; Deborah asked, suddenly serious. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t leave. Why don&#x2019;t you two try to settle your differences?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Deceit and lies are differences to be avoided, not settled. Ava Lynch&#x2019;s lies have done enough damage to this family . . . ,&#x201d; Aunt Lucille said darkly, shoving both hands into her brocaded silken pockets. Then, smiling, she added, &#x201c;I would love to stay for the rest of the party, but my physical therapy is so important these days. Let&#x2019;s talk later, dear.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Catching sight of Will on the picnic table as she reached the kitchen door, she threw him an exaggerated kiss and, her finger bouncing as if striking a note on an invisible piano, silently mouthed, &#x201c;You--be--good.&#x201d; With a wave, she was gone in a flash of blue silk.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Deborah followed Aunt Lucille to the center of the yard and announced, &#x201c;There&#x2019;s only one more donkey ride to go before we eat. It&#x2019;s the birthday boy&#x2019;s turn!&#x201d; She motioned for her younger son to come forward.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Mom, I don&#x2019;t need a commercial.&#x201d; The eight-year-old with the pouty lips and glasses rolled his eyes. Leo reluctantly edged past his friends toward a jumpy donkey leashed to an old bearded fellow.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;You ride as long as you want,&#x201d; Mrs. Wilder cooed to the red-faced Leo. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s your day. You&#x2019;re the boss.&#x201d; She returned to filling cups with punch and ordered Mr. Wilder to start doling out his precious hamburgers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>From the fence Andrew snapped a ten-dollar bill over his head, nodding knowingly at Will. Simon rotated his hands in a circular motion to spur Will to action.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Feeling the pressure, Will glared at Leo riding the donkey in lazy rings. He struggled to devise some way onto the animal&#x2019;s back.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Just then, something out of the corner of Will&#x2019;s eye drew his attention. A hunched black form crept into the very edge of his vision, sending a chill through his body. The air suddenly reeked, and his nose tingled. Will was afraid to look directly at the form, but he could feel its menace. Given its size, it could have been a crouching bear or even an ogre from one of his kiddie books. But when he mustered the courage to turn his head to face it, he saw nothing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Shadows and &#x201c;fuzzy things&#x201d; appearing in his peripheral vision had been an ongoing problem for Will since he was at least four years old. He had seen them at school, down near the Perilous River, even at friends&#x2019; houses. His mother had repeatedly taken him to the eye doctor to diagnose the problem. But each time, Dr. Schwartz reported that there was nothing wrong with Will&#x2019;s vision and that the shadows were likely the result of too little sleep. Dr. Schwartz suggested that they &#x201c;continue to monitor the situation&#x201d; and that Will get some extra rest.</p></p><h2>James Dean: Little Boy Lost</h2><p>He made only three movies - East of Eden, Rebel Without a Cause, and Giant - and became an international icon after his tragic death at the age of twenty-four. He was James Dean, and no one has told the real story of the man, the actor, the myth, as fully, as powerfully, and as intimately as the authors of James Dean: Little Boy Lost. This is the book drawn from extensive interviews with Dean's friends and colleagues, many of whom are speaking out for the first time...the book written by one of Dean's confidants...the book that Joe Hyams, noted celebrity biographer, has held back from writing - until now.<br>Who was James Byron Dean? After nearly four decades, many of the people who knew him best finally break their silence. To his friends - fellow actors like Elizabeth Taylor, Natalie Wood, Dennis Hopper, and Julie Harris - he was both generous and mean-spirited, solitary and social, macho and feminine, wise for his years and incorrigibly adolescent. To directors like Elia Kazan, Nicholas Ray, and George Stevens, he could be guilelessly open to suggestion one moment, yet arrogant and impossible the next. Most of all, the compelling enigma known as James Dean lived life joyously, painfully, and without restraint, embodying like no one else the conflicts and passions that are part of young people everywhere.<br>This book follows its fascinating subject from the Indiana farm where he spent an active but troubled boyhood, to the crucial, early training ground of the New York theater world, to his meteoric rise to international stardom in the movies. It shows how post-war Hollywood was still a charmed, leisurely community, yet one ripe for the explosive ascension of a dynamic new presence like James Dean. It reveals details never disclosed before of the making of his three landmark films. It candidly explores Dean's many love affairs and discusses with great insight the surprising truth about Dean's much-talked-about bisexuality. It exposes, as only an insider's book can, the true story of Dean and actress Pier Angeli - his one real love - and the shocking outcome of their liaison.<br>With sixteen pages of photographs, many never before published, James Dean: Little Boy Lost is the definitive story of a stunning young talent who lived too fast, died far too soon, but whose memory will live on as long as the youth of the world dare to hope, love, and dream.</p><p><b>Joe Hyams</b> (1923-2008) was a columnist and bestselling author most known for his biographies of such Hollywood stars as Humphrey Bogart, James Dean, and Lauren Bacall. Hyams became involved in the martial arts during his service in the US Army, where he was frequently attacked for being Jewish. His years of studying with such figures as Bruce Lee and Ed Parker laid the groundwork for his 1979 book <i>Zen in the Martial Arts</i>.<br><br></p><h2>The Snakebite Letters: Devilishly Devious Secrets for Subverting Society As Taught in Tempter&#39;s Training School</h2><p>By Peter J. Kreeft Taking his cue from the new literary genre invented by C. S. Lewis in Screwtape Letters, Peter Kreeft has gathered together fifteen spicy letters from Satan's agents below that allow the reader to spy into Hell's inter-office communication. Now that it is becoming more and more obvious that we are at war--not only cultural but spiritual war--it is also more necessary to understand our diabolical enemy and his strategy. Combining satire, humor and devilish insights, these fifteen letters from Snakebite to his trainee, Braintwister, provide a complete Satanic strategy for corrupting American society, public and private morality, and the Church. Focusing especially on the critical areas of sex, media, liturgy, theology and religious education, these letters reveal the inroads that Screwtape's satanic American counterparts of the 90s have made into subverting our modern culture. The Koran says: "Before shooting the arrow of truth, dip it in honey." This genre of devilish correspondence allows serious this-worldly social criticism to take the form of witty other-worldly letters.

Montgomery (Author) Mass Market Paperback: 325 pages Publisher: Bantam; 2nd edition (May 1, 1983)</p><p>Emily Starr was born with the desire to write. As an orphan living on New Moon Farm, writing helped her face the difficult, lonely times. But now all her friends are going away to high school in nearby Shrewsbury, and her old-fashioned, tyrannical aunt Elizabeth will only let her go if she promises to stop writng! All the same, this is the first step in Emily&#39;s climb to success. Once in town, Emily&#39;s activities set the Shrewsbury gossips buzzing. But Emily and her friends are confident -- Ilse&#39;s a born actress, Teddy&#39;s set to be a great artist, and roguish Perry has the makings of a brilliant lawyer. When Emily has her poems published and writes for the town newspaper, success seems to be on its way -- and with it the first whispers of romance. Then Emily is offered a fabulous opportunity, and she must decide if she wants to change her life forever.L.M.

It is about a 14-year-old Eskimo, Russel Susskit and his dogs, who is searching for answers about his life that he cannot find. His father could not tell him the answers-but a blind old man named Oogruk, sets him in the right direction. Disillusioned with modern life-such as &#34;snow machines&#34; and cooking meat-and his people losing tradition, Russel sets out on a quest in order to find himself, and the &#34;old ways&#34; of his people. Inspired by the Eskimo shaman Oogruk, Russel Susskit takes a dog team and sled to escape the modern ways of his village and to find his own &#34;song&#34; of himself. He travels across ice floes, tundra, and mountains, haunted along the way by a dream of a long-ago self whose adventures parallel his own. Reality melds with the dream when he finds an Eskimo girl who has run away from her village after becoming pregnant.

Scholastic/Apple, paper, $4.99 (0-439-84777-X).<br>Gr. 4&#x2013;7. From the very first page, the action is nonstop in this breathless thriller, the first book in Korman's Kidnapped series. Meg, 11, is abducted on her way home from school. Her brother, Aiden, 15, works with the FBI to find her and deliver the ransom money. In the meantime, Meg fights back with muscle and wit, even managing to sneak out an SOS letter. The hurtling plot, with mysterious meetings and high-tech surveillance, shifts between the two kids' viewpoints. As the first book in the Kidnapped series, this doesn't end with a rescue, and the references to what happened before this story actually begins (the kids' parents were framed for aiding terrorists and the kids survived as fugitives) are a bit confusing. Still, even reluctant readers will be asking for the second book, The Search, which is also now available. &#x2013;&#x2013;Hazel Rochman<br></p><h2>Learning to Love: Exploring Solitude and Freedom (The Journals of Thomas Merton Vol. 6)</h2><p>Having embraced a life of solitude in his own hermitage, Thomas Merton finds his faith tested beyond his imagination when a visit to the hospital leads to a clandestine affair of the heart. Jolted out of his comfortable routine, Merton is forced to reassess his need for love and his commitment to celibacy and the monastic vocation.This astonishing volume traces Merton&#x2019;s struggle to reconcile his unexpected love with his sacred vows while continuing to grapple with the burning social issues of the day &#x2013; including racial conflicts, the war in Vietnam, and the Arab-Israeli conflict &#x2013; visiting and corresponding with high-profile friends like Thich Nhat Hanh and Joan Baez, and further developing his writing career. Revealing Merton to be &#x2018;very human&#x2019; in his chronicles of the ecstasy and torment of being in love, Learning to Love comes full circle as Merton recommits himself completely and more deeply to his vocation even as he recognizes &#x2018;my need for love, my loneliness, my inner division, the struggle in which solitude is at once a problem and a &#x2018;solution&#x2019;. And perhaps not a perfect solution either&#x2019; (11 May, 1967).</p><p><p>Thomas Merton (1915-1968) is widely regarded as one of the most influential spiritual writers of modern times.

Higginson's response was presumably affirmative. I imagine a similar question posed by Merton: "Does my journal breathe?" To which I heartily respond, "Yes." -- <i>Anna J. Brown <i>America</i></i><br><br>"What one finds in Mertons' writings...is this discharge of the authentic self....What shines through in his writings and he never seemed to stop writing... is the luminous humanity of a devotion to the journey." -- <i>Toronta <i>Globe and Mail</i> </i><br><br><p>"Delightful . . . brilliant social, political and personal commentaries." -- <i><i>New York Times Book Review</i></i><br><br></p><p>"It has often been said that the world-renowned Trappist monk and author Thomas Merton was a man of paradox. . . . Now, [this] volume of Merton's journals adds greater detail to another, and perhaps his most surprising, paradox: that this monk and Roman Catholic priest had what he called an 'affair' with a student nurse in Louisville over six months in 1966." -- <i><i>Lexington Herald Leader</i></i><br><br></p><p>"When all the journals are published, it is likely that they will take a place with the famous journals of Henry David Thoreau, G.

Until the spring of 1841 he lived a simple, uneventful life with his wife and three children in Upstate New York. Then, suddenly, he fell victim to a series of bizarre events that make this one of the most amazing autobiographies ever written.<br>Northup accepted an offer from two strangers in Saratoga, New York, to catch up with their traveling circus and play in its band. But when the chase ended, Northup had been drugged, beaten, and sold to a slave trader in Washington, D.C. Subsequently, he was shipped to New Orleans, where he was purchased by a planter in the Red River region of Louisiana. For the next twelve years Northup lived as a chattel slave under several masters. He might well have died a slave, except for another set of bizarre circumstances which enabled him to get word to his family and finally regain his freedom.<br>These elements alone -- the kidnapping, enslavement, and rescue -- are sufficient for a sensational story. But Northup provides more. He was a shrewd observer of people and events. His memory was remarkable. He described cultivation of cotton and sugar in the Deep South. He detailed the daily routine and general life of the Negro slave. Indeed, he vividly portrayed the world of slavery -- from the underside.<br>Originally published in 1853, Northup's autobiography is regarded as one of the best accounts of American Negro slavery ever written by a slave. It is reprinted in full here for the first time, as the initial volume in The Library of Southern Civilization.<br>Northup's account has been carefully checked by the editors and has been found to be remarkably accurate. To his own narrative of a long and tragic adventure, Professors Eakin and Logsdon have added significant new details about Northup and the plantation country where he spent most of his time as a slave. Heretofore unknown information about the capture and trial of Northup's kidnappers has been included, adding still another fascinating episode to an already astounding story.</p></p><p>This story of the abduction of a free Negro adult from the North and his enslavement in the South--provides a sensational element which cannot be matched in any of the dozens of narratives written by former slaves. &#39;Think of it: For thirty years a man, wit all man&#39;s hopes, fears and aspirations--with a wife and children to call him by the endearing names of husband and father--with a home, humble it may be, but still a home...then for twelve years a thing, a chattel personal, classed with mules and horses....Oh! it is horrible. It chills the blood to think that such are.&#39;<p>Sue Eakin (1918-2009) taught history at Louisiana State University in Alexandria.<br>Joseph Logsdon (1938-2000) was an assistant professor of history at Louisiana State University in New Orleans.</p></p><h2>Distrust That Particular Flavor</h2><p>William Gibson is known primarily as a novelist, with his work ranging from his groundbreaking first novel, <i>Neuromancer</i>, to his more recent contemporary bestsellers <i>Pattern Recognition, Spook Country</i>, and <i>Zero History</i>.

To document his argument that people are not systematically educated and that overspecialization is rampant, the author (Ten Philosophical Mistakes takes us on an A-to-Z romp through encyclopedias, card catalogues and university curricula. Such thinkers as Aristotle, Bacon, Coleridge and Spencer have wrestled with the problem of how to organize all human knowledge. The core of this challenging, if peculiar, "guidebook" surveys some 20 thinkers in two- to four-page sections. Adler attempts to provide tools to make the leap from information to organized knowledge and wisdom. His proposal to map current disciplines includes an "outline of knowledge" that helped revolutionize the Encyclopaedia Britannica, and an "index of great ideas" embodied in the Great Books of the Western World series. Philosophy is restored as queen of the sciences in Adler's scheme, and poetry turns out to be philosophy's handmaiden. <br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.Adler's goal is to present a guide to learning for anyone who wishes to be truly educated in this century of the knowledge explosion. He criticizes the alphabetical arrangement of subjects in encyclopedias, library catalogs, and courses in university catalogs, which results in a bewildering chaos of segments of knowledge. Several chapters are devoted to a cursory survey of classification systems from ancient to present times. He suggests remedies for "alphabetiasis," describes the classification of knowledge in Encyclopedia Britannica's Propaedia, and recommends the Syntopicon of the Great Books of the Western World as a guide for learning. In spite of a few inaccuracies, this provocative book is required reading for educators and both students and practitioners in library and information science.

He lives in Banbury, England, with his wife and their two daughters, Laura and Rosie. This is his first picture book.<p>PreS-Gr 2-In a leap of reason fit only for silly tall tales out of the Wild West, Cowgirl Rosie is responsible for the care of five baby bison-Bigwig, Bonnie, Beefy, Butch, and Baby B. As with any big family, the youngsters keep Rosie busy. On a trip into town to visit Sheriff Joe, one by one, the bison disappear. "Oh calamity!" With the help of the sheriff, the young protagonist searches high and low for her babies. The two meet up with Snakey Jake, who coincidentally has five white bison in a flour sack. It is only when Rosie's unhappy tears fall like rain upon the flour-covered animals that their true identities are uncovered. With her handy lasso, Rosie thwarts Jake's attempt at escape, and the happy cowgirl is a local hero. For her reward, Sheriff Joe gives her a brand-new five-bison baby buggy. The hilarious language and predictability of this tale make it a fun choice to read aloud. The pace of the story is quick, and the vibrant illustrations convey not only the campy silliness of the story, but also incorporate traditional images of the West.

His career as a writer began in the late 1940s, but it was his 1972 novel <i>Cockfighter</i> that announced his name to a wider audience. Of that book, Harry Crews said, "Charles Willeford renders the sport with such knowledge and attention to detail that... I had the almost inexpressible impression of being on my knees again beside the great fighting pits of the southern circuit." Considered to be Willeford's masterpiece, <i>Cockfighter</i> is a brutal and beautiful fiction of the American South, loosely modeled, according to the author, on Homer's <i>Odyssey</i>. Frank Mansfield is the titular cockfighter: a silent and fiercely contrary man whose obsession with winning will cost him almost everything. Mansfield haunts the cockpits, bars and roads of the rural South in the early 1960s, adrift but always capable of nearly anything.

Aimlessly, unable to decide whether it wanted to fall up or down, just letting itself be driven by the hellish, ice-cold wind that was sweeping in from the great darkness covering the Oslo fjord. Together they swirled, wind and snow, round and round in the darkness between the warehouses on the quayside that were all shut for the night. Until the wind got fed up and dumped its dance partner beside the wall. And there the dry, windswept snow was settling around the shoes of the man I had just shot in the chest and neck.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Blood was dripping down onto the snow from the bottom of his shirt. I don&#x2019;t actually know a lot about snow&#x2014;or much else, for that matter&#x2014;but I&#x2019;ve read that snow crystals formed when it&#x2019;s really cold are completely different from wet snow, heavy flakes, or the crunchy stuff. That it&#x2019;s the shape of the crystals and the dryness of the snow that make the haemoglobin in the blood retain that deep red colour. Either way, the snow under him made me think of a king&#x2019;s robe, all purple and lined with ermine, like the drawings in the book of Norwegian folk tales my mother used to read to me. She liked fairy tales and kings. That&#x2019;s probably why she named me after a king.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The <i>Evening Post</i> had said that if the cold carried on like this until New Year, 1977 would be the coldest year since the war, and that we&#x2019;d remember it as the start of the new ice age scientists had been predicting for a while. But what did I know? All I knew was that the man standing in front of me would soon be dead. There was no mistaking the way his body was shaking. He was one of the Fisherman&#x2019;s men. It was nothing personal. I told him as much before he collapsed, leaving a smear of blood down the wall. If I ever get shot, I&#x2019;d rather it was personal. I didn&#x2019;t say it to stop his ghost coming after me&#x2014;I don&#x2019;t believe in ghosts. I just couldn&#x2019;t think of anything else to say. Obviously I could have just kept my mouth shut. That&#x2019;s what I usually do, after all. So there must have been something that made me so talkative all of a sudden. Maybe it was because there were only a few days to go before Christmas. I&#x2019;ve heard that people are supposed to feel closer to each other around Christmas. But what do I know?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I thought the blood would freeze on top of the snow and end up just lying there. But instead the snow sucked the blood up as it fell, drawing it in under the surface, hiding it, as if it had some sort of use for it. As I walked home I imagined a snowman rising up from the snowdrift, one with clearly visible veins of blood under its deathly pale skin of ice.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>On the way back to my flat I called Daniel Hoffmann from a phone box to tell him the job was done.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Hoffmann said that was good. As usual, he didn&#x2019;t ask any questions. Either he&#x2019;d learned to trust me in the course of the four years I&#x2019;d been working as a fixer for him, or else he didn&#x2019;t actually want to know. The job was done, so why would a man like him trouble himself with that sort of thing when what he was paying for was to have fewer problems? Hoffmann asked me to go down to the office the next day&#x2014;he said he had a new job for me.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;A new job?&#x201d; I asked, feeling my heart skip a beat.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Hoffmann said. &#x201c;As in a new commission.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, okay.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I hung up, relieved. I don&#x2019;t really do much more than commissions. I can&#x2019;t actually be used for much more than that.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Here are four things I can&#x2019;t be used for. Driving a getaway car. I can drive fast, that&#x2019;s fine. But I can&#x2019;t drive inconspicuously, and anyone driving a getaway car has to be able to do both. They have to be able to drive so they look just like any other car on the road. I landed myself and two other men in prison because I can&#x2019;t drive inconspicuously enough. I drove like a demon, switching between forest tracks and main roads, and I&#x2019;d long since lost our pursuers, and was just a few kilometres from the Swedish border. I slowed down and drove in a steady, law-abiding way like a grandad on a Sunday outing. And we still got stopped by a police patrol. They said afterwards that they had no idea it was the car used in the robbery, and that I hadn&#x2019;t been driving too fast or breaking any of the rules of the road. They said it was the <i>way</i> I was driving. I&#x2019;ve no idea what they meant, but they said it was suspicious.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I can&#x2019;t be used in robberies. I&#x2019;ve read that more than half of all bank employees who experience a robbery end up with psychological problems afterwards, some of them for the rest of their lives. I don&#x2019;t know why, but the old man who was behind the counter of the post office when we went in was in a big hurry to develop psychological problems. He fell to pieces just because the barrel of my shotgun was pointed in his general direction, apparently. I saw in the paper the next day that he was suffering from psychological problems. Not much of a diagnosis, but either way, if there&#x2019;s one thing you don&#x2019;t want, it&#x2019;s psychological problems. So I went to visit him in hospital. Obviously he didn&#x2019;t recognise me&#x2014;I&#x2019;d been wearing a Santa Claus mask in the post office. (It was the perfect disguise. No one gave a second glance to three lads in Santa Claus outfits carrying sacks as they ran out of a post office in the middle of the Christmas shopping crowds.) I stopped in the doorway to the ward and looked at the old man. He was reading <i>Class Struggle,</i> the Communist newspaper. Not that I&#x2019;ve got anything against Communists as individuals. Okay, maybe I have. But I don&#x2019;t <i>want</i> to have anything against them as individuals, I just think they&#x2019;re wrong. So I felt a bit guilty when I realised that I felt a lot better because the bloke was reading <i>Class Struggle.</i> But obviously there&#x2019;s a big difference between feeling a bit guilty and a lot guilty. And like I said, I felt a <i>lot</i> better. But I stopped doing robberies. After all, there was no guarantee the next one would be a Communist.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And I can&#x2019;t work with drugs, that&#x2019;s number three. I just can&#x2019;t do it. It&#x2019;s not that I can&#x2019;t get money out of people who are in debt to my employers. Junkies only have themselves to blame, and in my opinion people should pay for their mistakes, plain and simple. The problem&#x2019;s more that I have a weak, sensitive nature, as my mum once put it. I suppose she saw herself in me. Either way, I have to stay well away from drugs. Like her, I&#x2019;m the sort of person who&#x2019;s just looking for someone to submit to. Religion, a big-brother figure, a boss. Drink and drugs. Besides, I can&#x2019;t do math either, I can hardly count to ten without losing my concentration. Which is kind of stupid if you&#x2019;re going to sell drugs or collect debts&#x2014;that ought to be pretty obvious.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Okay. Last one. Prostitution. Same sort of thing there. I don&#x2019;t have a problem with women earning money whatever way they like, and the idea that a bloke&#x2014;me, for instance&#x2014;should get a third of the money for sorting things out so the women can concentrate on the actual work. A good pimp is worth every krone they pay him, I&#x2019;ve always thought that. The problem is that I fall in love so quickly, and then I stop seeing it in terms of business. And I can&#x2019;t handle shaking, hitting or threatening the women, whether or not I&#x2019;m in love with them. Something to do with my mother, maybe, what do I know? That&#x2019;s probably why I can&#x2019;t stand seeing other people beating up women either. Something just snaps. Take Maria, for instance. Deaf and dumb, with a limp. I don&#x2019;t know what those two things have got to do with each other&#x2014;nothing probably&#x2014;but it&#x2019;s a bit like once you start getting bad cards, they just keep coming. Which is probably why Maria ended up with an idiot junkie boyfriend as well. He had a fancy French name, Myriel, but owed Hoffmann thirteen thousand for drugs. The first time I saw her was when Pine, Hoffmann&#x2019;s head pimp, pointed out a girl in a home-made coat and with her hair up in a bun, looking like she&#x2019;d just left church. She was sitting on the steps in front of Ridderhallen, crying, and Pine told me she was going to have to pay back her boyfriend&#x2019;s drug debt in kind. I thought it best to give her a gentle start, just hand-jobs. But she jumped out of the first car she got into after barely ten seconds. She stood there in floods of tears while Pine yelled at her. Maybe he thought she&#x2019;d hear him if he shouted loud enough. Maybe that was what did it. The yelling. And my mum. Either way, something snapped, and even if I could see what Pine was trying to get into her head by the use of very loud sound waves, I ended up decking him, my own boss. Then I took Maria to a flat I knew was empty, then went to tell Hoffmann that I was no use as a pimp either.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But Hoffmann said&#x2014;and I had to agree with him&#x2014;that he couldn&#x2019;t let people get away without paying their debts, because that sort of thing soon spreads to other, more important customers. So, well aware that Pine and Hoffmann were after the girl because she&#x2019;d been stupid enough to take on her boyfriend&#x2019;s debts, I went out looking until I found the Frenchman in a squat up in Fagerborg. He was both wrecked by drugs and broke, so I realised I wasn&#x2019;t going to get a single krone out of him, no matter how much I shook him. I said that if he so much as approached Maria again I&#x2019;d smash his nose into his brain. To be honest, I&#x2019;m not sure there was much left of either of them. So I went back to Hoffmann, said the boyfriend had managed to get hold of some money, handed him thirteen thousand and said I presumed that meant hunting season on the girl was over.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I don&#x2019;t know if Maria had been a user while they were together, if she was the sort who looked for ways to be submissive, but she seemed pretty straight now, at least. She worked in a small supermarket, and I looked in every now and then to make sure things were okay, and that her junkie boyfriend hadn&#x2019;t popped up to ruin things for her again. Obviously I made sure she couldn&#x2019;t see me, just stood outside in the darkness looking into the well-lit shop, watching her sitting at the till, putting things in bags, and pointing at one of the others if anyone spoke to her. Every so often I suppose we all need to feel that we&#x2019;re living up to our parents. I don&#x2019;t know what Dad had that I could live up to&#x2014;this is probably more about Mum. She was better at looking after other people than herself, and I suppose I saw that as a kind of ideal back then. God knows. Either way, I didn&#x2019;t really have much use for the money I was earning from Hoffmann. So what if I dealt a decent card to a girl who&#x2019;d been given such a lousy hand?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Anyway. To sum up, let&#x2019;s put it like this: I&#x2019;m no good at driving slowly, I&#x2019;m way too soft, I fall in love far too easily, I lose my head when I get angry, and I&#x2019;m bad at math. I&#x2019;ve read a bit, but I don&#x2019;t really know much, and certainly nothing anyone would find useful. And stalactites grow faster than I can write.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So what on earth can a man like Daniel Hoffmann use someone like me for?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The answer is&#x2014;as you might have worked out already&#x2014;as a fixer.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I don&#x2019;t have to drive, and I mostly kill the sort of men who deserve it, and the numbers -aren&#x2019;t exactly hard to keep track of. Not right now, anyway.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There are two calculations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To start with, there&#x2019;s the one that&#x2019;s ticking away the whole time: When exactly do you reach the point where you know so much about your boss that he starts to get worried? And when do you know he&#x2019;s beginning to wonder if he ought to fix the fixer? Like one of those black widows. Not that I know much about arachnology or whatever it&#x2019;s called, but I think the widows let the males, who are much smaller, fuck them. Then, when he&#x2019;s finished and the female has no more use for him, she eats him. In <i>Animal Kingdom 4: Insects and Spiders</i> in the Deichman Library there&#x2019;s a picture of a black widow with the male&#x2019;s chewed-off pedipalp, which is like the spider&#x2019;s cock, still hanging from her genitals. And you can see the blood-red, hourglass-shaped mark on the female&#x2019;s abdomen. Because the hourglass is running, you pathetic, randy little male spider, and you need to keep to your allotted visiting time. Or, to be more accurate, you need to know when visiting time is over. And then you get the fuck out of there, come what may, with a couple of bullets in the side or whatever&#x2014;you just have to get away, to the only thing that can save you.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That&#x2019;s how I saw it. Do what you have to, but don&#x2019;t get too close.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And that&#x2019;s why I was seriously fucking worried about the new job Hoffmann had given me.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He wanted me to fix his wife.</p></p><h2>The Famished Road</h2><p>Azaro, a &#34;spirit-child&#34; from a ghetto community in Africa, uses his instinctual memory from ancient times to see the hate and violence that keep his people trapped in poverty</p><p>You have never read a novel like this one. Winner of the 1991 Booker Prize for fiction, <i>The Famished Road</i> tells the story of Azaro, a spirit-child. Though spirit-children rarely stay long in the painful world of the living, when Azaro is born he chooses to fight death: "I wanted," he says, "to make happy the bruised face of the woman who would become my mother." Survival in his chaotic African village is a struggle, though. Azaro and his family must contend with hunger, disease, and violence, as well as the boy's spirit-companions, who are constantly trying to trick him back into their world. Okri fills his tale with unforgettable images and characters: the bereaved policeman and his wife, who try to adopt Azaro and dress him in their dead son's clothes; the photographer who documents life in the village and displays his pictures in a cabinet by the roadside; Madame Koto, "plump as a mighty fruit," who runs the local bar; the King of the Road, who gets hungrier the more he eats.<p> At the heart of this hypnotic novel are the mysteries of love and human survival. "It is more difficult to love than to die," says Azaro's father, and indeed, it is love that brings real sharpness to suffering here. As the story moves toward its climax, Azaro must face the consequences of choosing to live, of choosing to walk the road of hunger rather than return to the benign land of spirits. <i>The Famished Road</i> is worth reading for its last line alone, which must be one of the most devastating endings in contemporary literature (but don't skip ahead). <i>--R. Ellis</i></p>Set in the ghetto of an African city during British colonial rule, this rich, phantasmagorical novel follows Azaro, a "spirit-child" who has reneged on a pact with the spirit world. Winner of the 1991 Booker Prize, this book is "something approaching a masterpiece of magic realism...." -- <i>The Wall Street Journal</i></p><h2>Visual History of the King James Bible, A: The Dramatic Story of the World&#39;s Best-Known Translation</h2><p>For 400 years the King James Version of the Holy Bible has been the most influential book to be published in the English language.

This number used to be much smaller, but interest in Wicca, Witchcraft, and contemporary magic has increased exponentially over the past few decades. The dramatic rise of this Nature-based religion is due at least in part to the Internet&#x2014;just twenty years ago, people curious about these subjects often had little access to credible information, especially those without a good New Age or Occult bookstore nearby. But the appeal of Wicca is also growing in tandem with the increasing complexities of our modern, high-pressured mainstream society.<br><br>The world we live in today seems wholly distant from the one our ancestors lived in&#x2014;a world where humans and Nature were at one, their existence intertwined in the natural cycles of life. Amid all of our gadgets and other man-made distractions, many people forget to take notice of the sheer beauty of the natural world that still surrounds us. Wicca teaches us to appreciate the Earth, celebrating the intricate changes in the seasons and everything they bring&#x2014;from the bounties of the Summer harvest to the cold and darkness of the Winter months, when Mother Nature rests in preparation for the next explosive cycle of life that begins in Spring.<br><br>As you&#x2019;ll discover in this book, Wicca is a reincarnation of the very earliest religions, practiced for millennia before the advent of Christianity. It is often referred to as &#x201c;the Old Religion,&#x201d; and many Wiccans consider their practice to fit within a broader tradition of Witchcraft that has been passed down over the centuries. Wiccans celebrate and share many of the same beliefs our ancestors held, with practices that honor the old ways while being compatible with contemporary life. The divine is worshipped as both masculine and feminine, with a focus on balance and harmony with Nature, and a recognition of the magical power inherent in the Universe as well as in ourselves. It is an empowering religion, rooted in ancient times and yet well-suited for the 21st century.<br><br><p><b>Foundations of Wiccan Belief and Practice</b></p><i>Wicca for Beginners</i> was created as an entry point for anyone seeking information about this fascinating religion. It is intended as a broad introduction, covering the most basic questions that people curious about Wicca tend to have. Whether you're just looking to learn more about the Wiccan way of life, or you want to start practicing Wicca yourself, you will have a solid understanding of the essence of Wicca after reading this book:<br><br><ul> <li><b>The history of Wicca: its modern foundations as well as its ancient inspirations</b></li> <li>An introduction to the God and Goddess and their multiple aspects</li> <li><b>The Wiccan holidays of the Wheel of the Year: the Sabbats and the Esbats</b></li> <li>Core elements of Wiccan ritual, including an overview of ritual tools</li> <li><b>Principles of magic&#x2014;both ancient and modern</b></li> <li>An overview of Wiccan covens, circles, and solitary practice</li> <li><b>Example ritual and spellwork suitable for beginners</b></li> <li>Sample tables of correspondence identifying the magical properties of selected colors, crystals, herbs and oils</li></ul>Until fairly recently, centuries of suppression of the Old Religion meant that Wiccans and other Witches had to maintain strict secrecy about their practices. Thankfully, we have entered a much more enlightened age, with resources like Wicca for Beginners to help dispel the old misconceptions about Witchcraft and magic. By the end of the book you will have a solid sense for the basics of Wicca and Witchcraft, and, I hope, a stronger desire to pursue this path.<br><br><p><b>If you're ready to begin your Wiccan journey, scroll to the top of the page and hit the Buy button.

Decades later, George is as curious--and naughty--as ever. To celebrate the 60th anniversary of Curious George's debut, this special edition is a collection of seven classic adventures by Margret and H.A. Rey, along with an introduction by critic Leonard Marcus, a retrospective note by publisher Anita Silvey, a history of the Reys by Dee Jones, curator of the de Grummond Children's Literature Collection, and a photo album. The many generations of fans of the "good little monkey who was always very curious" will be fascinated to learn how H.A. and Margret escaped on bicycle from German-occupied Paris, with just their winter coats and several picture books (including a draft of <i>Curious George</i>, then called <i>Fifi</i>) strapped to the racks. Photos and essays reveal H.A. to have been a gentle, humorous man, while Margret, by all accounts, was spirited and brutally direct, with a keen business mind. The chemistry between them worked beautifully. Between them, they created one of the most beloved characters in children's literature. This handsome volume includes <i>Curious George</i>, <i>Curious George Takes a Job</i>, <i>Curious George Rides a Bike</i>, <i>Curious George Gets a Medal</i>, <i>Curious George Flies a Kite</i>, <i>Curious George Learns the Alphabet</i>, and <i>Curious George Goes to the Hospital</i>. (Ages 4 to 8) <i>--Emilie Coulter</i>Hans Augusto Rey was born in Hamburg, Germany in 1898. As a child, he spent much of his free time in that city&#39;s famous Hagenbeck Zoo drawing animals. After serving in the army during World War I, he studied philology and natural science at the University of Hamburg. He then married Margret Rey and they moved to Montmartre for four years. The manuscript for the first Curious George books was one of the few items the Reys carried with them on their bicycles when they escaped from Paris in 1940. Eventually, they made their way to the United States, and Curious George was published in 1941. Curious George has been published in many languages, including French, German, Japanese, Afrikaans, and Norwegian. Additional Curious George books followed, as well as such other favorites as CECILY G. AND THE NINE MONKEYS and FIND THE CONSTELLATIONS.</p><h2>NIV/The Message Parallel Bible (New International Version)</h2><p>The Message Designed to read like a letter from God, The Message presents Scripture the way it originally appeared, as a naturally flowing narrative.

The dead are called Histories, and the vast realm in which they rest is the Archive. Da first brought Mackenzie Bishop here four years ago, when she was twelve years old, frightened but determined to prove herself. Now Da is dead, and Mac has grown into what he once was: a ruthless Keeper, tasked with stopping often-violent Histories from waking up and getting out. Because of her job, she lies to the people she loves, and she knows fear for what it is: a useful tool for staying alive.<br><br>Being a Keeper isn&#x2019;t just dangerous it&#x2019;s a constant reminder of those Mac has lost. Da&#x2019;s death was hard enough, but now that her little brother is gone too, Mac starts to wonder about the boundary between living and dying, sleeping and waking. In the Archive, the dead must never be disturbed. And yet, someone is deliberately altering Histories, erasing essential chapters. Unless Mac can piece together what remains, the Archive itself might crumble and fall.<br><br>In this haunting, richly imagined novel, Victoria Schwab reveals the thin lines between past and present, love and pain, trust and deceit, unbearable loss and hardwon redemption.&nbsp;Advance praise for <i>THE ARCHIVED</i>:&nbsp; &#x201c;This gripping supernatural thriller features nuanced characters navigating a complex moral universe.&#x201d; <i>Kirkus Reviews</i></p><p>Victoria Schwab is the author of <i>The Near Witch</i>--which <i>Kirkus</i> praised for its "shivery horror tang"--as well as several upcoming novels. Victoria suffers from a wicked case of wanderlust, but when she's not haunting Paris streets or trudging up English hillsides, she can usually be found tucked in the corner of a coffee shop in Nashville, sipping tea and dreaming up monsters.Gr 9 Up-Mackenzie was just 11 when her Da passed along the heavy responsibility of being a "Keeper": one in charge of returning Histories to the Archive. A History is a sort of ghost, but more like a copy of a dead person's life. Librarians keep every History on a shelf, in a complex and rigid order. But every once in a while one slips (becomes restless and crazed) and escapes the orderly Archive into the chaos of the Narrows-a lightless series of corridors filled with doors. A Keeper's role is to return the Histories to the Archive lest they escape into the real world. When her family moves to an old hotel turned apartment building called the Coronado after the tragic death of her beloved little brother, Mac's workload of wandering Histories begins increasing exponentially. Plus, she meets a strange-looking Goth guy named Wes who shocks her by confessing that he, too, is a Keeper, and she begins to bond with him. Soon the ordered quiet of the Archive is booming with the noise of escaped Histories, and there appears to be a saboteur. Mac uncovers a dark secret held in the walls of the Coronado. Something terrible happened there and great lengths have been taken to cover it up. Stranger still is Owen, whom Mac encounters in the Narrows, a History who is not on her list and somehow has not yet slipped. Schwab skillfully manages that rare accomplishment: a spine-tingling, supernatural, ghostly mystery that is fully believable.

Included in each large-format volume are gorgeous food and landscape photographs.</p><p>Provence is loved for its sunlit beauty and earthy, tantalizing cuisine. Both are celebrated in <i>Provence the Beautiful Cookbook</i>, an oversized (more than two feet tall!) picture and cookbook of breathtaking color photos and authentic regional recipes. The 270 recipes, compiled and written by award-winning food book author Richard Olney, include soups and starters; seafood, meat, game, and poultry dishes; vegetable and grain specialties; and simple but luscious desserts. Readers seeking an armchair tour of the region, singularly depicted, and the chance to see and reproduce its dishes, will delight in the book, which would also make a welcome gift. <p> Beginning with an introduction to the land and its cooking, the book then weaves short essays about the Proven�al regions with recipes arranged by courses. There are exemplary versions of bouillabaisse and bourride (the creamy, garlic-infused fish chowder), estouffade (braised beef, here with olives and mushrooms), daubs (stews), vegetable-filled omelets, and tians (savory gratins). Less familiar treasures include a mixed herb pasta from Alpes-de-Haute-Provence, porgy with crab sauce from the Var, a braised stuffed lamb shoulder from Vaucluse, zucchini and rice gratin from the Alpes Maritimes, and dried figs in thyme and red wine syrup, also from the Var. The recipes reflect Olney's unerring palate and dedication to tradition; some cooks may find certain dishes beyond their reach, but all will discover approachable recipes that are easily made. Wine information and a glossary conclude the portrait of Provence and its table--a feast for the eye and palate alike. <i>--Arthur Boehm</i></p>Richard Olney was born in Marathon, Iowa, and has lived in France since 1951.

The stunning debut of a lively new culinary voice, <em>The Cook and the Gardener</em> chronicles a year in the life of the walled kitchen garden at Chateau du Fey and its taciturn, resourceful, charmingly sly peasant caretaker. Using the fruits and vegetables harvested from Monsieur Milbert's garden, Amanda Hesser creates four seasons of recipes tied ineluctably to the land and the all-but-forgotten practices upheld by Milbert. Hesser's sublimely simple recipes&#x2015;each with accessible ingredients and clear notes and instructions&#x2015;also tell a story. They are a month-by-month record of the ingredients available to her, so that this cookbook also serves as an almanac for cooks. Special "Basics" sections at the opening of each season lay the culinary groundwork for the recipes that follow. Tips on how to buy, store, and prepare particular vegetables, fruits, and herbs are presented in margin notes to recipes. By bringing the kitchen closer to the garden, <em>The Cook and the Gardener</em> gives home cooks a new understanding of the produce they have on hand, whether from the supermarket, the farmer's market, or their own gardens. At the same time, it captures the quirky customs and wily wisdom of a vanishing way of life in provincial France.</p><p><i>The Cook and the Gardener</i> is Amanda Hesser's first book. From the opening lines of its introduction, her literary gifts are as evident as her passion for good food. Since this work combines recipes with her essays about Monsieur Milbert (the gardener at the Chateau du Fey in Burgundy, where Hesser worked as the cook), readers get to enjoy both of her talents. <p> Hesser worked hard to get M. Milbert to talk with her. She shares the careful, deliberate way she wooed him, sometimes by bringing freshly baked bread to his less mobile wife, sometimes by holding back questions she wanted to ask, just to win his tolerance of her presence. Crusty, surly, and tradition-bound, he is the quintessential French peasant. Fortunately, Hesser--who is respectful and patient even when M. Milbert's stubborn ways exasperated her--knows he is an almost-vanished breed. None of his children, or anyone else, is likely to work as he has, continuing to live mainly off the land for nearly 60 years.</p><p> Each chapter covers a month, starting with March, when the nearly 400-year-old walled garden comes to life. Hesser talks about the garden, how she used the bounty gathered by M. Milbert, and muses on life in and around Burgundy. In September, "the rains seemed to clean off and illuminate the plants' colors ... everything seemed to wake up, as after a hot, cranky nap." The final tomatoes are harvested, as are the green and butter beans, with Milbert sneakily keeping the best for himself. Hesser visits a neighbor's Portuguese-style garden, as exuberant and vivid as Milbert's is restrained and disciplined. She cooks saut�ed red snapper with tomatoes, fennel, and vermouth; makes a profound Tomato Consomm�; and slow roasts tomatoes into meltingly tender mounds.</p><p> Sepia drawings by Kate Gridley add to the low-key charm of this information-packed work. (It even includes a history of purslane going back to the Middle Ages.)</p><p> The knowledge and maturity of this work belie Hesser's youth. Not yet 30 at the time of writing, she's a wise cook worth following. <i>--Dana Jacobi</i></p><p><strong>Amanda Hesser</strong>, co-founder and CEO of Food52, is the author of the award-winning <em>The Essential New York Times Cookbook</em>, <em>Cooking for Mr. Latte</em>, and <em>The Cook and the Gardener</em>, as well as the editor of the essay collection <em>Eat, Memory</em>.

Life so often seems like a turbulent river threatening to drown us and destroy our world. Why, then, shouldn&#x2019;t we cling to the certainty of the comfortable&#x2014;to our deep-seated habits and familiar ways?

The teachings she presents here&#x2014;known as the &#x201c;Three Commitments&#x201d;&#x2014;provide a treasure trove of wisdom for learning to step right into the unknown, to completely and fearlessly embrace the groundlessness of being human.

Underlying them all is the basic instruction to make friends with yourself&#x2014;to be honest with yourself and kind. This begins with the willingness to stay present whenever you experience uneasiness. As these feelings arise, rather than running away, you lean into them. Instead of trying to get rid of thoughts and feelings, you become curious about them. As you become accustomed to experiencing sensation free of interpretation, you will come to understand that contacting the fundamental ambiguity of being human provides a precious opportunity&#x2014;the opportunity to be with life just as it is, the opportunity to experience the freedom of life without a story line."<br>&#x2014;from <i>Living Beautifully</i></p><h2>Brotherhood of the Screaming Abyss: My Life with Terence McKenna</h2><p>For those who lived through what is sometimes called the Psychedelic Revolution, Terrence McKenna is a legend. Once referred to as &#34;the intellectual&#39;s Timothy Leary.&#34; Terence attained iconic status as a radical philosopher, futurist, cultural critic, and raconteur. His unorthodox ideas about the evolutionary and cultural impact of psychedelic drugs shocked many and resonated with many others. In 1971, we embarked on an expedition to the Amazon, bent on uncovering the real mystery behind psychedelic experience. Terrence died in 2000, never to learn if his predictions about the end of the world, in his particular sense, were true. As Terence&#39;s younger brother and only sibling, I grew up with him in a small town in western Colorado during the fifties and sixties. Traveling together in the Colombian Amazon in 1971 with a few other kindred spirits we called our band &#34;the Brotherhood of the Screaming Abyss.&#34; As Terence&#39;s brother, I helped him create and develop many of &#34;his&#34; ideas. Terence became the spokesman for the alien dimensions accessed through psychedelics, a philosopher of the unspeakable, a beloved and sometimes reviled bard of the marvels and occasional terrors waiting in the recesses of human consciousness. By choice and inclination, I stayed in the background, pursuing a scientific career in disciplines that ranges from ethnopharmachology and ethnobotany to neuroscience. Since Terence&#39;s death, we&#39;ve witnessed the first decade of a new era that by all early indications will be as strange and disturbing, as full of hope and despair, as any period that humanity has yet endured.

This is the fascinating true story of how one man beat the odds and changed the way America plays the stock market. And it is an inspiration to all individual investors who want to learn the smartest way to manage their finances, grow their businesses, and increase the value of their investments.</p> <p>In November 1983, O'Neil laid out his plans to start a brand-new national paper, Investor's Daily (its original name until Sept. 16, 1991). Unlike the Wall Street Journal, the industry's heavyweight champ for the past century, IBD would give daily ratings for every stock to measure profit growth and stock-price strength. For the first time, investors would be able to compare stocks against other stocks. The paper would also print charts of the major indexes so readers could study the market's overall price trend. It would run about 100 small weekly charts daily to ensure that no great stock would be ignored. IBD would feature new growing companies in detail and update a table of nearly 200 industry groups ranked by six-month performance. In short, IBD wouldn't be like any other financial publication.</p> <p>Achieving profitability wasn't IBD's only goal. Teaching readers to understand how the stock market really works would help them protect their interests even during severe market downswings. When the U.S. stock market lost an estimated $7 trillion in shareholder wealth during the 2000---2002 bear market, those who followed IBD's advice were able to cash out and save the majority of their portfolios. By providing a daily education on sound stock investing based on 50 years of fact-based stock market research, IBD has become a unique tool and information source that helps investors build wealth through buying, holding, and eventually selling the best growth stocks in the market. Along the way, the paper has debunked many of the myths on investing by highlighting the most relevant data for finding the big winners. This is O'Neil's legacy--a wealth of insight that will change the way you invest and succeed.</p> <p><b>Financial experts agree: Investor's Business Daily is always right on the money</b></p> <p>"Thanks for being the 11th Secret to Success for two decades." </p> <p>--Larry Weinbach, Chairman and CEO, Unisys Corporation</p> <p>"Congratulations to Investor's Business Daily on 20 great years of providing readers with excellent financial coverage and investment information."</p> <p>--Salvatore F.

Resurrected by the power of an alien race, for reasons they can only guess at, unlikely fellow travelers like Mark Twain, Hermann Goring, and Cyrano de Bergerac wander the banks of a ten-million-mile-long river in search of their makers and the answers to this mystery. Now some of their questions have been answered, and even more raised, by their discovery of the giant tower that rises from Riverworld&#39;s north polar sea. Here is the great computer that controls the resurrection process -- and their mastery of that mechanism will make them like gods in Riverworld, with power of life and death over those billions of human lives. But they are not alone in the tower. Strange footsteps in the corridors, attempts on their lives, one &#34;accident&#34; after another, all lead them to an inevitable conclusion; either there is an assassin left behind in the tower -- or one of their band is a traitor!</p><p>billion people from throughout Earth's history were resurrected along the great and winding waterways of Riverworld. Most began life anew--accepting without question the sustenance provided by their mysterious benefactors. But a rebellious handful burned to confront the unseen masters who controlled their fate--and these few launched an invasion that would ultimately yield the mind-boggling truth.<br><br>Now Riverworld's omnipotent leaders have been confronted, and the renegades of Riverworld--led by the intrepid Sir Richard Francis Burton--control the fantastic mechanism that once ruled them. But the most awesome challenge lies ahead. For in the vast corridors and secret rooms of the tower stronghold, an unknown enemy watches and waits to usurp the usurpers . . .<br>"A FEAST FOR THE IMAGINATION."<br>--Los Angeles Times<br><br>"A virtual playground for SF's growing fascination with history."<br>--Locus<br></p><h2>Visionseeker</h2><p>In this remarkable work, Dr. Wesselman reveals what it means to be a mystic and a medicine man in an age of high technology and super science.

VISIONSEEKER, his third book, details his many encounters with spirits who lived at other times. Although spiced with musical bridges at the beginning and end of each side, the book overall is a disappointment. Wesselman speaks in a monotonous drone, sounding as if he is giving a six-hour lecture. His voice is a flat monotone, even during intense or emotional passages.

In this study of the Gospels based upon a demonstrable literary theory, Randel Helms presents the work of the four evangelists as the &#34;supreme fictions&#34; of our culture, self-conscious works of art deliberately composed as the culmination of a long literary and oral tradition.Helms analyzes the best-known and the most powerful of these fictions: the stories of Christ&#39;s birth, his agony in the Garden of Gethsemane, his betrayal by Judas, his crucifixion, death and resurrection. In Helms&#39; exegesis of the Gospel miracle stories, he traces the greatest of these - the resurrection of Lazarus four days after his death - to the Egyptian myth of the resurrection of Osiris by the god Horus.Helms maintains that the Gospels are self-reflexive; they are not about Jesus so much as they are about the writers&#39; attitudes concerning Jesus. Helms examines each of the narratives - the language, the sources, the similarities and differences - and shows that their purpose was not so much to describe the past as to affect the present.This scholarly yet readable work demonstrates how the Gospels surpassed the expectations of their authors, influencing countless generations by creating a life-enhancing understanding of the nature of Jesus of Nazareth.</p><p><b>Randel Helms&nbsp;</b>is a writer, professor, biblical scholar, and specialist in the works of William Blake and&nbsp;J.R.R. Tolkien. Helms was born in Alabama and was educated at the University of California Riverside. After leaving school, Helms began teaching at a number of universities around the United States. Many of his books are dedicated to debunking the Bible as fiction. He is the author of&nbsp;<i>Gospel Fictions, Who Wrote the Gospels,&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>The Bible Against Itself.</i></p><h2>Prey (Aliens Vs.

HE WHO DESIRES TO DIE WELL, MUST LIVE WELL I NOW commence the rules to be observed in the Art of dying well. This art I shall divide into two parts: in the first I shall speak of the precepts we must follow whilst in good health; in the other of those we should observe when we are dangerously ill, or near death&#x2019;s door. We shall first treat of those precepts that relate to virtue; and afterwards of those which relate to the sacraments: for, by these two we shall be especially enabled both to live well, and to die well. But the general rule, &#x201c; that he who lives well, will die well,&#x201d; must be mentioned before all others: for since death is nothing more than the end of life, it is certain that all who live well to the end, die well; nor can he die ill, who hath never lived ill; as, on the other hand, he who hath never led a good life, cannot die a good death. The same thing is observable in many similar cases: for all that walk along the right path, are sure to arrive at the place of their destination; whilst, on the contrary, they who wander from it, will never arrive at their journey&#x2019;s end. They also who diligently apply to study, will soon become learned doctors; but they who do not, will be ignorant. But, perhaps, some one may mention, as an objection, the example of the good thief, who lived ill and yet died well. This was not the case; for that good thief led a holy life, and therefore died a holy death. But, even supposing he had spent the greater part of his days in wickedness, yet the other part of his life was spent so well, that he easily repented of his former sins, and gained the greatest graces. For, burning with the love of God, he openly defended our Saviour from the calumnies of His enemies; and filled with the same charity towards his neighbour, he rebuked and admonished his blaspheming companion, and endeavoured to convert him. He was yet alive when he thus addressed him, saying: &#x201c;Neither dost thou fear God, seeing thou art under the same condemnation? And we indeed justly, for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done no evil.&#x201d; (St. Luke 23:40, 41.) Neither was he dead when, confessing and calling upon Christ, he uttered these noble words: &#x201c;Lord, remember me when thou shalt come into thy kingdom.&#x201d; The good thief then appeared to &#x201c;have been one of those who came last into the vineyard, and yet he received a reward greater than the first.&#x201d; True, therefore, is the sentence, &#x201c; He who lives well, dies well;&#x201d; and, &#x201c;He who lives ill, dies ill.&#x201d; We must acknowledge that it is a most dangerous thing to deter till death our conversion from sin to virtue: far more happy are they who begin to carry the yoke of the Lord &#x201c;from their youth,&#x201d; as Jeremiah saith; and exceedingly blessed are those, &#x201c;who were not defiled with women, and in whose mouth there was found no lie: for they are without spot before the throne of God. These were purchased from among men, the first-fruits to God and to the Lamb.&#x201d; (Apoc. 14:4, 5.) Such were Jeremias, and St. John, &#x201c;more than a prophet;&#x201d; and above all, the Mother of our Lord, as well as many more whom God alone knoweth. This first great truth now remains established, that a good death depends upon a good life.</p><p>John Dalton is Director of London School of Public Relations and Branding (LSPR) and LSPR-Worldwide.

Tour.</p><p>Eagle Pond Farm, familiar even to casual readers of poet Donald Hall (author of 13 volumes of poetry spanning over 40 years), constitutes his spiritual and geographic center. He moved there permanently in 1975 after marrying the young and talented poet Jane Kenyon. His long relationship to Eagle Pond Farm and the creative haven the two poets created gives <i>Without</i> a special poignancy. It is where, in 1995, Jane Kenyon died.<p> The facts are hard but simple. In 1994, Jane Kenyon--who at 46 was beginning to enjoy the growing recognition of her work--was diagnosed with leukemia. Kenyon and Hall opted for the harrowing bone marrow transplant, to be performed in Seattle. It was not successful, and 12 weeks later, she was dead. Hall began drafting <i>Without</i> during the procedure and subsequent treatment, an act almost impossible to imagine--or perhaps for a poet, the only act possible in the face of what for most would be unspeakable. The magnitude of such suffering might indeed explain the collection's flatness of tone, as if grief can be touched only across great distances.</p><p> However restrained the pieces, Hall's gaze is fearless. Shifts in voice (he writes both in first and third person) create a tension that pulls the reader forward, as if compelled to consume this moving, raw account in one sitting. The quality of reader attention is more akin to what one gives a story. Narrative elements include a terse account of the bone-marrow transplant and Kenyan's subsequent radiation treatments ("It was as if she capped the Chernobyl pile with her body"), and it's here that the poems become almost unbearable to read.</p><p> <i>Without</i> captures the tedium of dying, jolted by surges of rage and "witless" love. Numbly, it lists the flinty details of Kenyon's last days, spent choosing the poems for her last volume, <i>Otherwise: New &amp; Selected Poems</i>. It describes the moment of her dying in a way that makes one wonder if the ultimate experience of intimacy is to watch the beloved die, to be the one to close her eyes. "Back home from the grave," Hall writes toward the end of this volume, "behind my desk I made / a gallery of Janes," but it can be said that every poem presents a facet of his wife while dying, accruing finally to a gallery of love and grief.</p><p> There are some distinguishing jolts to our familiar concepts about death as in, for example, the poem showing the couple, with their minister, praying and holding hands. And when they prayed, "grace was evident / but not the comfort of mercy or reprieve / The embodied figure / on the cross still twisted under the sun." By and large, however, it's a volume not remarkable for bold imagery or shocking connections; rather for the expression of raw grief that follows, unwelcome, all of our necessary losses. <i>--Hollis Giammatteo</i></p>DONALD HALL, poet laureate of the United States from 2006 to 2007, has received the National Book Critics Circle Award, the Los Angeles Times Book Prize in poetry, the Lenore Marshall Award, the 1990 Frost Medal from the Poetry Society of America, and the Ruth Lilly Poetry Prize. He is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters.</p><h2>The First American Revolution: Before Lexington and Concord</h2><p>In an eye-opening look at the history of America&#39;s revolutionary struggle, the author of A People&#39;s History of the American Revolution describes how, in the years prior to the Battle of Lexington and Concord, local people took the British authority to declare themselves free from colonial oppression. 10,000 first printing.</p><p><b>Ray Raphael</b> is the author of numerous books, including <i>A People's History of the American Revolution, An Everyday History of Somewhere, Men from the Boys</i>, and <i>Tree Talk</i>. He lives in northern California.Historian Raphael contends that the United States' war for independence did not begin in April 1775 with the "shot heard round the world." Rather it began the previous summer in rural towns like Worcester as patriots forced royal appointees to publicly resign their offices. These actions brought to a standstill the courts and public bodies established under the Massachusetts Government Act. The thousands of farmers and artisans then reclaimed the Charter of 1691 to democratically reopen the courts, establish new governmental bodies and organize a network of militias. Raphael thus brings into clear focus events and identities of ordinary people who should share the historic limelight with the Founding Fathers. This successful rebellion has until now remained obscure, the author says, because "[t]he telling of history cries out for individual protagonists" while this revolution was decentralized and nonhierarchical, creating not leaders but a participatory democracy that, in Raphael's view, "far outreached the intentions of the so-called `Founding Fathers.'" Moreover, unlike Lexington and Concord, this revolution involved no dramatic shedding of blood. Whether or not "the transfer of political authority to the American patriots" in 1774 was the "real revolution" making the clash in April 1775 a British counter-revolution to regain lost territory Raphael (A People's History of the American Revolution) makes a compelling case that these early events were critical to the success of the war that followed and should no longer escape our notice. His liberal use of primary sources (excerpts from town records, newspapers, letters, etc.), authoritative secondary sources and his meticulous care in footnoting will prove extremely useful for further study. <br>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Explorers (The Australians)</h2><p>Ladies maid Jessica Maclaine and sea captain Justin Broome find each other amid desperate rebels and adventurers in the wild country of early colonial Australia</p><p></p><h2>The Case For Democracy</h2><p>Natan Sharansky believes that the truest expression of democracy is the ability to stand in the middle of a town square and express one's views without fear of imprisonment. He should know. A dissident in the USSR, Sharansky was jailed for nine years for challenging Soviet policies. During that time he reinforced his moral conviction that democracy is essential to both protecting human rights and maintaining global peace and security. <p> Sharansky was catapulted onto the Israeli political stage in 1996. In the last eight years, he has served as a minister in four different Israeli cabinets, including a stint as Deputy Prime Minister, playing a key role in government decision making from the peace negotiations at Wye to the war against Palestinian terror. In his views, he has been as consistent as he has been stubborn: Tyranny, whether in the Soviet Union or the Middle East, must always be made to bow before democracy. </p><p> Drawing on a lifetime of experience of democracy and its absence, Sharansky believes that only democracy can safeguard the well-being of societies. For Sharansky, when it comes to democracy, politics is not a matter of left and right, but right and wrong. </p><p> This is a passionately argued book from a man who carries supreme moral authority to make the case he does here: that the spread of democracy everywhere is not only possible, but also essential to the survival of our civilization. His argument is sure to stir controversy on all sides; this is arguably the great issue of our times.</p></p><p><b>Natan Sharansky</b> is a former Soviet dissident, political prisoner, and human rights icon who has spent his life championing democracy and freedom. He now serves as the Minister for Jerusalem and Diaspora Affairs in the Israeli Government.Cited by the current administration as a strong influence on the president, Sharansky's work is part political philosophy, part biography. The two genres are intertwined effortlessly by the former Soviet political prisoner who is now a political leader in Israel. Simon Vance presents a sophisticated and thoughtful reading. His voice is what one would imagine Sharansky's voice might sound like: articulate, cosmopolitan, and passionate. Vance's speech has the accent of one whose first language is not English, but who is a careful English speaker. The core argument is that the world is divided between free and "fear" societies and the way to fight the latter is by promoting freedom. Sharansky also argues that freedom is a universal aspiration of human beings.

He is perhaps most famous for his series of Flashman novels, featuring his antihero Harry Flashman. In addition to his novels, he wrote numerous screenplays, most notably&nbsp;<i>The Three Musketeers</i>&nbsp;and the James Bond film&nbsp;<i>Octopussy</i>. George MacDonald Fraser died in 2008 at the age of 82.Fraser's Flashman yarns are a guilty pleasure: shamelessly enjoyable, yet utterly reprehensible, like a diet of chocolate creams. Harry Flashman--and this is the ninth volume of his exploits, complete, like the others, with its very real scholarly apparatus of notes and sources--is vain, cowardly, a hypocrite and a sexist lecher. Yet such is the zest and skill with which Fraser relates his adventures that the reader is seldom aware of being thoroughly manipulated into a sneaking admiration for this Victorian soldier of fortune who always finds himself in the thick of things, whether in India, Africa or at Custer's Last Stand; the books are allegedly parts of his memoirs. This time the scene is the Punjab as the outnumbered British forces face a formidable Sikh army. Behind the scenes are a glamorous but corrupt maharani (who is bedded by Flashman), her son and various devious pretenders. Flashman, who speaks the lingo, is acting as secret agent on behalf of the British but somehow always gets involved in battles he seeks to avoid. The atmosphere is colorful in the extreme, the battle scenes are splendidly rendered and some decidedly odd British commanders are deftly sketched. Flashman ultimately emerges with the famous Koh-i-Noor diamond, which he is seen in a delicious prologue discussing with an elderly Queen Victoria. For Flashman fanciers, this is one of his best; for others, an ideal introduction. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Greenleaf Guide to Famous Men of the Renaissance and Reformation</h2><p>A study guide with background information, discussionquestions, and suggested activities toaccompany Famous Men of the Renaissance &amp;Reformation.

So it is that through the telling of one Chinese peasant woman's life, a vivid vision of Chinese history and culture is illuminated. Over the course of two years, Ida Pruitt&#x2015;a bicultural social worker, writer, and contributor to Sino-American understanding&#x2015;visited with Ning Lao T'ai-ta'i, three times a week for breakfast. These meetings, originally intended to elucidate for Pruitt traditional Chinese family customs of which Lao T'ai-t'ai possessed some insight, became the foundation for an enduring friendship. As Lao T'ai-t'ai described the cultural customs of her family, and of the broader community of which they were a part, she invoked episodes from her own personal history to illustrate these customs, until eventually the whole of her life lay open before her new confidante. Pruitt documented this story, casting light not only onto Lao T'ai-t'ai's own biography, but onto the character of life for the common man of China, writ large. The final product is a portrayal of China that is "vividly and humanly revealed."</p><p>Ida Pruitt was a social worker, interpreter, and speaker who worked to advance cultural understanding between China and the United States. She authored several books including <em>A China Childhood</em>, <em>Old Madam Yin: A Memoir of Peking Life, 1926-1938</em>, and <em>Tales of Old China</em>."This is surely the warmest, most human document that has ever come out of China. . . . The report of her life and labors has the lasting symbolic quality of literature."&#x2013;The American Journal of Sociology<br><br>"No recent book has better portrayed the common man in China. . . . This short autobiography is right in description of Chinese Social customs. . . . In writing this book, Ida Pruitt has rendered a great service to the Chinese people.

An Oxford graduate in history, he is largely self-taught in art criticism. How this distinguished colleague of Bernard Berenson and Kenneth Clark honed his analytical skills and rose to eminent positions at the British Museum, the Victoria and Albert Museum and New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art should make for a fascinating story, but this genteel self-portrait does not live up to its title.

Fogg and have an exciting adventure.</p><p>Ages 5-7. When Jack McTavish marries Marion McGillicuddy, they decide they can afford either a wonderful, speedy car that doesn't break down or lots of children. Then they hit upon a compromise. They'll have just a few children--six or seven--and make do with an old rattlebang of a car. So seven children later, the McTavishes enjoy going on trips to places like Shark Park in their undersized, overstuffed green car. Also along for the ride is Granny McTavish, loved by the children except when it comes to the hard-as-rock pizzas she insists on making. This story has all the kick one would expect from another Mahy-Kellogg pairing. The family has wild adventures during their picnics on the beach and at the river, but when they head up to Mount Fogg, the fun really begins. Their clunker car bumps and grinds up the winding, rocky road. Coming down is harder. Mount Fogg is a volcano, and when the lava spits out, it's time to go. But the old rattlebang isn't up to the ride. It loses a wheel, and not until the kids come up with the idea of using one of Granny's pizzas in its stead are they able to flee the flow. Kellogg's chock-a-block pictures erupt, too--with kids, playthings, pizzas, and car parts. P.S.: Watch for the hippos sneaking into the artwork, runaways from <i>The Boy Who Was Followed Home</i> (1986). <i>Ilene Cooper</i>The distinguished duo behind the droll The Boy Who Was Followed Home offer another absurdly amusing but less satisfying tale. The newlywed MacTavishes forgo the purchase of a reliable new car in favor of "an old rattlebang" so that they can also afford to have seven children. The whole family, including Granny MacTavish, piles in the rattlebang on picnic adventures. Granny is known for baked goods that are "tougher than old boots," and at Shark Park her picnic pizzas are more useful as Frisbees than food. Kellogg's boisterous, detailed illustratons underscore just how tough the pizzas are by showing a shark whose teeth fly out of his mouth after one bite. (Discerning fans will also chuckle over subtle cameo appearances from players in other Kellogg works.) When the family picnics at Mt. Fogg, the hot springs and geysers provide hours of fun--until Mt. Fogg erupts, and the rattlebang loses one of its wheels. As the "sinister hiss of red-hot lava" moves threateningly close, the children rally to the rescue by proposing that one of Granny's pizzas be used as a tire. While many will enjoy Mahy's spirited family, abrupt transitions may prevent the reader from forming more than a superficial connection to the story.

Tickle puts each day&#x2019;s prayers, psalms, readings, and refrains&#x2013;everything you need&#x2013;in one place. The rhythm that Tickle&#x2019;s book establishes gives one a stronger sense of participating in an ancient, worldwide but very personal liturgy.&#x201d;<br>&#x2013;Nora Gallagher, <i>beliefnet.com</i>, and author of <i>Things Seen and Unseen: A Year Lived in Faith<br></i><br>The third and final volume in a trilogy of prayer manuals compiled by <i>Publishers Weekly</i> religion editor Phyllis Tickle as a contemporary Book of Hours to guide Christians gently yet authoritatively through the daily offices.<br><br><i>The Divine Hours </i>is the first major literary and liturgical reworking of the sixth-century Benedictine Rule of fixed-hour prayer. This beautifully conceived and thoroughly modern three-volume guide will appeal to the theological novice as well as to the ecclesiastical sophisticate. Making primary use of the Book of Common Prayer and the writings of the Church Fathers, <i>The Divine Hours </i>is also a companion to the New Jerusalem Bible, from which it draws its Scripture readings. The trilogy blends prayer and praise in a way that, while extraordinarily fresh, respects and builds upon the ancient wisdom of Christianity. <br><br>The third and final book in the set, <i>Prayers for Springtime</i>, provides prayers, psalms, and readings for this season associated with rebirth. Compact, with deluxe endpapers, it is perfect for those seeking greater spiritual depth. As a contemporary Book of Hours, <i>The Divine Hours:<b> </b>Prayers for Springtime<b> </b></i>heralds a renewal of the tradition of disciplined daily prayer, and gives those already using the first two volumes the completion they are seeking. With this volume, the series culminates with three prayer manuals encompassing the liturgical and calendar year with the offices for every day.</p><p><i>The Divine Hours</i> completes the celebrated trilogy of fixed-hour prayer manuals edited by Phyllis Tickle. Where gospel and shared meals are known as the "food and sustenance of the Church," the fixed-hour prayer is the "work," according to Tickle, religion editor for <i>Publishers Weekly</i>. Fans of the previous <i>Divine Hours</i> books (<i>Prayers for Summertime</i>, <i>Prayers for Autumn and Wintertime</i>) applaud Tickle's uncomplicated format, her use of a modern calendar rather than a liturgical one, and the single ribbon in the binding, which is, amazingly, all that readers need to track the daily offices. Fixed-hour prayers (also called "keeping the hours" or "saying the offices") are listed for each calendar day--morning, midday, and evening. Almost all of the sacred readings are from the New Jerusalem Bible, and the psalms and psalm hymns are lifted from the Book of Common Prayer. Some readers may object to the occasional passages with traditional, patriarchal language ("Almighty God, my heavenly Father: I have sinned against you, through my own fault....") Be assured that Tickle chose these readings carefully, no doubt relying upon her extensive religious studies and strong feminine perspective, as evidenced in her excellent memoir <i>The Shaping of a Life</i>. <i>--Gail Hudson</i>Chapter 1<br><br>The Gloria<br><br>Glory be to God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit.

Like the Magna Carta and the American Revolution, the English Civil War resolved fundamental questions of sovereignty and political rights that are still the guiding principles of democracies today. However, the price of peace included the execution of a king, brutal persecution of Catholics and Royalists, and years of tyranny. Drawing on exciting new sources, including letters, memoirs, ballads, plays, illustrations, and even cookbooks, Diane Purkiss creates a rich and nuanced portrait of this turbulent era. Purkiss peoples her story with fascinating characters, from the obstinate King Charles I to his opponents such as the poet John Milton, from the brutal and egomaniacal Oliver Cromwell to the self-styled prophet Lady Eleanor Davies, to witchfinders, revolutionaries, and ordinary men and women. The English Civil War�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s dramatic consequences&#x2014;rejecting divine right monarchy in favor of parliamentary rule&#x2014;continue to influence our lives. In this colorful narrative, Diane Purkiss vividly brings to life the history that changed the course of Western government.</p><p><b>Diane Purkiss</b> is a Fellow and Tutor at Keble College, Oxford.

She holds a B.A. from the University of Queensland, and a Ph.D. from Merton College, Oxford. She lives in Oxford, England.There are many ways to approach the history of the 17th-century upheaval that beheaded a king and laid the foundations for democratic revolutions to come, and this absorbing, ungainly study tries them all. Oxford historian Purkiss (<i>The Witch in History</i>) draws a gallery of sharp biographical sketches of participants from Cromwell to ordinary soldiers, paying special attention to the oft-neglected doings of women, like aristocratic intriguer Lucy Hay and radical dissenter Anna Trapnel. She also slathers on plenty of social history, digressing on everything from contemporary housing to cookbooks. And she interweaves an avowedly disjointed, episodic kings-and-battles narrative of military campaigns and political maneuverings, replete with dramatic eyewitness accounts. Fixated on trees rather than the forest, Purkiss offers no clear overview of events or much coherent interpretation of the conflict, aside from some facile psychoanalysis ("Charles I's longing to make the monarchy independent of any hurtful criticism proceeded from the bullied child he was"). The book doesn't work as a general introduction, but readers who already know some of the history will find it full of colorful personalities and scenes and evocative period writings that bring to life the people, culture and violent turmoil of the age.

New typesetting and beautiful hardbound cover.</p><p>The Council of Trent, held in the sixteenth century, was one of the Church&#39;s most important Ecumenical Councils. It was presided over by Popes Paul III, Julius III, and Pius IV. The Council played a major role in the Counter-Reformation against Martin Luther&#39;s principles and was itself a significant reform conference. Its main objectives were to condemn the doctrines of Protestantism, effect a reformation in the Church&#39;s discipline, make known the fact that the Church\&#39;s interpretation of Scripture is final, and define the relationship of faith and works in relation to salvation. Also an important point of discussion was the Real Presence and sacrificial nature of the Eucharist. The Council of Trent convened in 1545 and ended in 1563.</p><h2>Caretaker (Star Trek Voyager, No 1)</h2><p>A novelization of the first episode of Star Trek: Voyager finds the crew of the starship Voyager thrown across the galaxy, where they must form an alliance with dangerous enemies in order to get home.

We must blame ourselves for misinterpreting them. One-Eye&#x2019;s handicap in no way impairs his marvelous hindsight.<br>Lightning from a clear sky smote the Necropolitan Hill. One bolt struck the bronze plaque sealing the tomb of the forvalaka, obliterating half the spell of confinement. It rained stones. Statues bled. Priests at several temples reported sacrificial victims without hearts or livers. One victim escaped after its bowels were opened and was not recaptured. At the Fork Barracks, where the Urban Cohorts were billeted, the image of Teux turned completely around. For nine evenings running, ten black vultures circled the Bastion. Then one evicted the eagle which lived atop the Paper Tower.<br>Astrologers refused readings, fearing for their lives. A mad soothsayer wandered the streets proclaiming the imminent end of the world. At the Bastion, the eagle not only departed, the ivy on the outer ramparts withered and gave way to a creeper which appeared black in all but the most intense sunlight.<br>But that happens every year. Fools can make an omen of anything in retrospect.<br>We <em>shouldhave been better prepared. We did have four modestly accomplished wizards to stand sentinel against predatory tomorrows&#x2014;though never by any means as sophisticated as divining through sheeps&#x2019; entrails.</em><br>Still, the best augurs are those who divine from the portents of the past. They compile phenomenal records.<br>Beryl totters perpetually, ready to stumble over a precipice into chaos. The Queen of the Jewel Cities was old and decadent and mad, filled with the stench of degeneracy and moral dryrot. Only a fool would be surprised by anything found creeping its night streets.<br>* * *<br>I had every shutter thrown wide, praying for a breath off the harbor, rotting fish and all. There wasn&#x2019;t enough breeze to stir a cobweb. I mopped my face and grimaced at my first patient. &#x201c;Crabs again, Curly?&#x201d;<br>He grinned feebly. His face was pale. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s my stomach, Croaker.&#x201d; His pate looks like a polished ostrich egg. Thus the name. I checked the watch schedule and duty roster. Nothing there he would want to avoid. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s bad, Croaker. Really.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Uhm.&#x201d; I assumed my professional demeanor, sure what it was. His skin was clammy, despite the heat. &#x201c;Eaten outside the commissary lately, Curly?&#x201d; A fly landed on his head, strutted like a conqueror. He didn&#x2019;t notice.<br>&#x201c;Yeah. Three, four times.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Uhm.&#x201d; I mixed a nasty, milky concoction. &#x201c;Drink this. All of it.&#x201d;<br>His whole face puckered at the first taste. &#x201c;Look, Croaker, I....&#x201d;<br>The <em>smellof the stuff revolted me. &#x201c;Drink, friend. Two men died before I came up with that. Then Pokey took it and lived.&#x201d; Word was out about that.</em><br>He drank.<br>&#x201c;You mean it&#x2019;s poison? The damned Blues slipped me something?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Take it easy. You&#x2019;ll be okay. Yeah. It looks that way.&#x201d; I&#x2019;d had to open up Walleye and Wild Bruce to learn the truth. It was a subtle poison. &#x201c;Get over there on the cot where the breeze will hit you&#x2014;if the son of a bitch ever comes up. And lie still. Let the stuff work.&#x201d; I settled him down.<br>&#x201c;Tell me what you ate outside.&#x201d; I collected a pen and a chart tacked onto a board. I had done the same with Pokey, and with Wild Bruce before he died, and had had Walleye&#x2019;s platoon sergeant backtrack his movements. I was sure the poison had come from one of several nearby dives frequented by the Bastion garrison.<br>Curly produced one across-the-board match. &#x201c;Bingo! We&#x2019;ve got the bastards now.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Who?&#x201d; He was ready to go settle up himself.<br>&#x201c;You rest. I&#x2019;ll see the Captain.&#x201d; I patted his shoulder, checked the next room. Curly was it for morning sick call.<br>I took the long route, along Trejan&#x2019;s Wall, which overlooks Beryl&#x2019;s harbor. Halfway over I paused, stared north, past the mole and lighthouse and Fortress Island, at the Sea of Torments. Particolored sails speckled the dingy grey-brown water as coastal dhows scooted out along the spiderweb of routes linking the Jewel Cities. The upper air was still and heavy and hazy. The horizon could not be discerned. But down on the water the air was in motion. There was always a breeze out around the Island, though it avoided the shore as if fearing leprosy. Closer at hand, the wheeling gulls were as surly and lackadaisical as the day promised to make most men.<br>Another summer in service to the Syndic of Beryl, sweating and grimy, thanklessly shielding him from political rivals and his undisciplined native troops. Another summer busting our butts for Curly&#x2019;s reward. The pay was good, but not in coin of the soul. Our forebrethren would be embarrassed to see us so diminished.<br>Beryl is misery curdled, but also ancient and intriguing. Its history is a bottomless well filled with murky water. I amuse myself plumbing its shadowy depths, trying to isolate fact from fiction, legend, and myth. No easy task, for the city&#x2019;s earlier historians wrote with an eye to pleasing the powers of their day.<br>The most interesting period, for me, is the ancient kingdom, which is the least satisfactorily chronicled. It was then, in the reign of Niam, that the forvalaka came, were overcome after a decade of terror, and were confined in their dark tomb atop the Necropolitan Hill. Echoes of that terror persist in folklore and matronly admonitions to unruly children. No one recalls what the forvalaka were, now.<br>I resumed walking, despairing of beating the heat. The sentries, in their shaded kiosks, wore towels draped around their necks.<br>A breeze startled me. I faced the harbor. A ship was rounding the Island, a great lumbering beast that dwarfed the dhows and feluccas. A silver skull bulged in the center of its full-bellied black sail. That skull&#x2019;s red eyes glowed. Fires flickered behind its broken teeth. A glittering silver band encircled the skull.<br>&#x201c;What the hell is that?&#x201d; a sentry asked.<br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know, Whitey.&#x201d; The ship&#x2019;s size impressed me more than did its flashy sail. The four minor wizards we had with the Company could match that showmanship. But I&#x2019;d never seen a galley sporting five banks of oars.<br>I recalled my mission.<br>I knocked on the Captain&#x2019;s door. He did not respond. I invited myself inside, found him snoring in his big wooden chair. &#x201c;Yo!&#x201d; I hollered. &#x201c;Fire! Riots in the Groan! Dancing at the Gate of Dawn!&#x201d; Dancing was an old time general who nearly destroyed Beryl. People still shudder at his name.<br>The Captain was cool. He didn&#x2019;t crack an eyelid or smile. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re presumptuous, Croaker. When are you going to learn to go through channels?&#x201d; Channels meant bug the Lieutenant first. Don&#x2019;t interrupt his nap unless the Blues were storming the Bastion.<br>I explained about Curly and my chart.<br>He swung his feet off the desk. &#x201c;Sounds like work for Mercy.&#x201d; His voice had a hard edge. The Black Company does not suffer malicious attacks upon its men.<br>* * *<br>Mercy was our nastiest platoon leader. He thought a dozen men would suffice, but let Silent and me tag along. I could patch the wounded. Silent would be useful if the Blues played rough. Silent held us up half a day while he made a quick trip to the woods.<br>&#x201c;What the hell you up to?&#x201d; I asked when he got back, lugging a ratty-looking sack.<br>He just grinned. Silent he is and silent he stays.<br>The place was called Mole Tavern. It was a comfortable hangout. I had passed many an evening there.

Except Dash. She knew without confirming that he&#x2019;d be here, just as he&#x2019;d been here on this day for the previous two years, waiting to take her to the cemetery to visit and put fresh flowers on her husband&#x2019;s grave.</p><p>The flowers were on the counter beside her, just waiting for her to pick up and carry out of the house. But she hesitated, because this year . . . This year was different. She was apprehensive and yet resolved.</p><p>She had to move on with her life. She had to let go. It hurt, and yet at the same time, it brought her a measure of relief, as if a great weight had been lifted from her shoulders. It was time. All she had left to do was visit Carson&#x2019;s grave and make peace with her decision.</p><p>She smoothed her shirt and ran her hands down the legs of her jeans. Not what she normally wore to the cemetery on the anniversary of her husband&#x2019;s burial. In the last two years, she&#x2019;d worn black. It hadn&#x2019;t seemed respectful to go casual, as if the visit wasn&#x2019;t that important.</p><p>But she also knew that Carson wouldn&#x2019;t want her to live like this. He&#x2019;d want her to be happy. And it wouldn&#x2019;t have made him happy to know she still mourned him so deeply.</p><p>With a sigh, she applied a light gloss to her lips and quickly fastened her long hair into a ponytail, leaving part of it loose in a messy bun.</p><p>This was the real Joss. Not fussy. More comfortable in jeans and a casual shirt than the expensive dresses and jewelry her husband had loved to spoil her with. Only underneath her clothing did she wear the sexy lingerie her husband had so loved to see her in.</p><p>She closed her eyes, refusing to look back, to remember how it felt when he touched her. How his hands moved over her body, knowing it better than she knew it herself. He knew exactly how to please her, how to touch her, kiss her, make love to her.</p><p>He&#x2019;d given her everything she could have ever wanted. His love. His respect. Everything but the one thing she needed most, and it was something she could have never asked him for. She&#x2019;d loved him too much to ever demand of him something he couldn&#x2019;t give her.</p><p>She shook away the heavy veil of sadness, determined to get through the day and on with her life. Her new life.</p><p>She picked up the flowers, her favorite, brought them to her nose, closing her eyes as she inhaled. They were what Carson always gave her. Every birthday. Every anniversary. Or any time just because. Today she&#x2019;d place them on his grave and walk away. This time for good.</p><p>She didn&#x2019;t need to see the cold slab of marble that marked his life and death to remind her of her husband. That wasn&#x2019;t the way she wanted to remember him. She was through torturing herself by standing over his grave, missing him with her every breath.</p><p>He&#x2019;d live in her heart and soul always. That was where she&#x2019;d visit him in the future. Not on the grassy knoll that covered the casket underneath.</p><p>She walked briskly to the front door, letting herself out and blinking against the sudden wash of sun. Though it was spring, the Houston weather was already warm and she was glad she&#x2019;d worn the short sleeved T-shirt instead of the black dress she always wore.</p><p>And there was Dash, leaning against his car, waiting for her as she knew he would be. He straightened when he saw her, and she saw a brief flicker of surprise before he schooled his features and extended a hand to her.</p><p>She slid her fingers over his and he gave her hand a light squeeze. No words were necessary. They both grieved the loss of her husband and his best friend.</p><p>&#x201c;You look lovely, Joss,&#x201d; Dash said as he walked her around to the passenger side.</p><p>She smiled, knowing she didn&#x2019;t look particularly lovely today. And he was likely surprised by her casual appearance, but he didn&#x2019;t remark on it. He took the flowers and carefully positioned them in the back so they wouldn&#x2019;t fall over, and then closed her door after ensuring she was fully inside.</p><p>She watched him stride around the front of the car, his long legs eating up the distance in a matter of seconds. Then he slid into the driver&#x2019;s seat and his scent wafted through her nostrils.</p><p>Dash always smelled the same. Utterly masculine, though she knew he never wore cologne or aftershave. He was a no-frills kind of guy, much like Carson had been, though her husband had worn expensive clothing and even his casual wear was tailored to fit his personality.</p><p>Even Dash&#x2019;s car fit his personality. A sleek black Jaguar. How appropriate he drove a vehicle named for a predator. He fit the part well.</p><p>They&#x2019;d been partners in business, but Carson had always been the front man. The one who wined and dined clients, the polished spokesman, the one who sealed the deals, attended all the social events while Dash worked behind the scenes. The closer. The one who always did most of the legwork and fixed the problems.</p><p>Carson had often laughed and said he was the looks and charm and Dash was the brains of the operation. But Dash was certainly not lacking in looks or charm. They were the complete antithesis of one another. Carson was fair-haired to Dash&#x2019;s dark brown and while Carson&#x2019;s eyes were blue, Dash&#x2019;s were a deep brown, enhanced by his darker coloring. He wasn&#x2019;t any less attractive than Carson. His was just a quieter attractiveness. Silent. Brooding almost. He had made Joss nervous back when she&#x2019;d first met him when she and Carson had dated. Theirs had been a whirlwind courtship. Carson had swept her off her feet, and Joss had known that Dash was concerned that his friend was getting in way over his head. Moving too fast. The fact Joss knew that had made her wary of Dash, but over time, he&#x2019;d become her rock. Especially after Carson had died.</p><p>As they drove out of Joss&#x2019;s exclusive subdivision, Dash reached over for her hand, lacing his fingers through hers, and as he&#x2019;d done before, he squeezed lightly, a gesture of reassurance.</p><p>Joss turned and smiled at him, telling him without words that she was okay. As they stopped at a red light, Dash studied her intently, almost as if he were trying to decipher what was different about her.</p><p>Evidently satisfied with whatever he&#x2019;d seen in her eyes or expression, he smiled back, but he kept hold of her hand as he navigated through traffic on the way to the cemetery, just a few miles from where Joss and Carson had lived.</p><p>The drove in comfortable silence, but then they&#x2019;d never conversed much on the day Dash drove her to the cemetery every year. Oh, Joss visited at other times, but Dash always accompanied her on the anniversary.</p><p>But that wasn&#x2019;t the only time she saw Dash. He&#x2019;d stepped in from the moment Carson had passed away and he&#x2019;d been her rock ever since. That first year especially, she&#x2019;d needed him desperately and he never hesitated, no matter what she needed, whether it was help deciphering the paperwork and red tape after her husband&#x2019;s death or simply coming over to keep her company on the days she felt herself falling apart.</p><p>She would be forever grateful for Dash and his unwavering support over the last three years, but it was time to move on. It was time for her to stand on her own two feet and it was time for Dash to stop having to babysit her.</p><p>Today was not only about her letting go of Carson, but of Dash as well. He deserved more than to be saddled with the responsibility of his best friend&#x2019;s widow. He had a life of his own. She had no idea of his relationships or if he was even in a steady relationship. She realized with sudden clarity just how selfish and self-absorbed she&#x2019;d been since her husband&#x2019;s death. Dash had been a steady fixture, one she&#x2019;d taken for granted, but she would do it no longer. It would be a miracle if Dash were in a steady relationship because not many women would be tolerant of Dash dropping everything to rush to the aid of his best friend&#x2019;s widow.</p><p>When they arrived at the cemetery, Dash parked and Joss immediately got out, not waiting for him to come around for her. She opened the door to the backseat and leaned in to retrieve the flowers.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll get them, Joss.&#x201d;</p><p>Dash&#x2019;s low voice brushed over her ears, causing a prickle at her nape. She picked up the vase and turned with a reassuring smile.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got it, Dash. I&#x2019;m okay.&#x201d;</p><p>He gave her an inscrutable stare and she got the impression he was studying her again, trying to peel back the layers and get into her head. It was as if he knew something was different but couldn&#x2019;t put his finger on it. Which was just as well, because Joss would die if Dash could read her thoughts. If he knew just what it was she&#x2019;d planned and how she intended to move on with her life.</p><p>He&#x2019;d be horrified, no doubt. He&#x2019;d wonder if she&#x2019;d finally snapped and he&#x2019;d probably haul her into a shrink&#x2019;s office so fast it would make her head spin. Which was why she had no intention of letting him know.</p><p>Her girlfriends were another matter. Chessy would understand absolutely. She&#x2019;d even be encouraging. Kylie . . . not so much.</p><p>Kylie was Joss&#x2019;s sister-in-law, Carson&#x2019;s only sibling. They&#x2019;d both grown up in horrific circumstances, and just as Carson could never provide what Joss craved&#x2014;needed&#x2014;neither would Kylie ever understand what drove Joss.</p><p>She might even be angry with Joss&#x2019;s choices. Might think it was a betrayal of her brother. Joss could only hope she&#x2019;d support Joss even if she didn&#x2019;t fully understand.</p><p>But she was getting ahead of herself. First the cemetery and talking to Carson one last time. Then she&#x2019;d tackle her best friends over lunch. She needed as much as possible to keep busy today, because tonight?</p><p>Tonight was when it all began.</p><p>Joss waited for the betraying sting of tears as they neared Carson&#x2019;s grave. But oddly, she felt at peace for the first time in three long years. Yes, it was time.</p><p>She knelt and gently brushed away the leaves and dust at the base of the headstone before setting the vase of flowers in the middle. Her gaze drifted upward to the inscription. The reminder of Carson&#x2019;s birth and death.</p><p>Her finger slowly traced the words. Beloved husband, brother and best friend. Those words said it all. A reminder of those left behind who mourned him still. She&#x2019;d insisted that Dash be honored on the headstone, as he was every bit as much family as herself and Kylie. She only wished they&#x2019;d had children so his legacy and memory would live on through them.</p><p>But as with any young couple, they&#x2019;d thought they had all the time in the world. Carson was apprehensive about having children. He feared that he shared the same genetic traits that his father had possessed. No matter how many times Joss had gently reminded him that he was nothing like his father, Carson still lived in fear of hurting those he loved the most.</p><p>She understood his fear. She knew how much he loved her. She also knew he&#x2019;d die before ever hurting her or any children they had. But the darkness of his past still overshadowed his present. The past still haunted his dreams at night. Though Kylie, his sister, hadn&#x2019;t spoken of it often, Joss knew that Kylie had the same nightmares that Carson had. That she shared many of the same sleepless nights Carson experienced.</p><p>A wave of sadness overtook Joss. Such a waste. Carson&#x2019;s father had destroyed the lives of two innocent children. Worse, he lived on well into their adulthood, influencing their choices, always living in their fears even though he was dead. He still held them in his grasp from the grave, his memory and the memories of all he did torturing them still.</p><p>&#x201c;Joss?&#x201d;</p><p>Dash softly called her name, breaking through her thoughts, and she realized just how long she&#x2019;d knelt there at the base of the monument, tracing the inscription with her fingers.</p><p>He sounded worried and a little uncertain, and Dash was never nothing if not sure of himself.</p><p>She turned, tilting her head up so her gaze connected with Dash&#x2019;s.</p><p>&#x201c;Give me a moment please. Wait for me at the car if you don&#x2019;t mind. I&#x2019;ll only take a few minutes and then I&#x2019;ll be ready to go.&#x201d;</p><p>Again, surprise flickered in Dash&#x2019;s eyes. Never before had she asked to be left alone at Carson&#x2019;s grave. It had been too difficult, too emotional. Dash had always remained at her side, steady and strong, her rock to lean on. He&#x2019;d stayed with her as long as she wanted to remain and then he&#x2019;d take her back to the car and back home, where he&#x2019;d spend the rest of the afternoon sitting with her as she cried on his shoulder.</p><p>Not today. Not anymore.</p><p>&#x201c;If you&#x2019;re sure,&#x201d; he said hesitantly.</p><p>She nodded firmly, making sure no tears threatened. She wasn&#x2019;t going to unravel in front of him. She&#x2019;d been doing that far too long.</p><p>&#x201c;All right,&#x201d; he conceded. &#x201c;Take your time, honey. I&#x2019;ve arranged to take the entire day off.&#x201d;</p><p>She smiled. Of course he would have. But she didn&#x2019;t intend for him to spend it with her as he&#x2019;d done in the past. There was too much to get done before tonight. And she didn&#x2019;t want to chance breaking her resolve and confiding in Dash. Not only was it not appropriate, but he would most certainly not approve. He&#x2019;d think she&#x2019;d lost her damn mind.</p><p>And maybe she had. Or perhaps she was just getting it back.</p><p>She turned back as Dash headed back toward the car and then pushed herself upward to stand over the grave. She stared down, her jaw tight, locking down her emotions for the conversation she intended to have with her husband.</p><p>&#x201c;I love you, you know,&#x201d; she said, almost as if he were standing there in front of her. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll always love you, Carson. But I want you to know I&#x2019;m going to move on. Try to move on,&#x201d; she amended. &#x201c;Starting tonight. I know there were . . . things . . . you couldn&#x2019;t give me. And I want you to know I never resented you for that. God, I loved you far too much to ever expect you to give me something it was impossible for you to give.</p><p>&#x201c;But you&#x2019;re gone now.&#x201d;</p><p>Her voice cracked as she said the last, and she swallowed back the surge of tears.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m lonely, Carson. I miss you so much. Not a day goes by that I don&#x2019;t miss you. You were so good to me. The love of my life. I know I&#x2019;ll never find that again. Finding perfection once in a lifetime is incredible. But twice? No, I know there&#x2019;ll never be another for me like you. But there are things I . . . need,&#x201d; she whispered. &#x201c;Things you couldn&#x2019;t give me. Things I&#x2019;d never ask you for. And I wanted to come here today to tell you. To say that I wouldn&#x2019;t be back. Not because I don&#x2019;t love you or that I&#x2019;m going to forget you. But this isn&#x2019;t what I want my memory of you to be. I want to remember you in life. And us in love. And it&#x2019;s too painful for me to come here and talk to you, knowing that I&#x2019;ll never get you back.&#x201d;</p><p>She took a deep breath and forged ahead.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve found a place that specializes in . . . dominance. I need to know if it&#x2019;s what I&#x2019;m missing. If it&#x2019;s always been what I&#x2019;m missing. Maybe I&#x2019;ll find the answer. Maybe I won&#x2019;t. But I have to try. I have to know. And I couldn&#x2019;t go without telling you. Without explaining that I never lacked for anything when we were married. I never doubted even for a moment that you loved me, and you would have given me the moon if I asked. But this . . . This I couldn&#x2019;t ask you for. And right now I need something to fill the void. There&#x2019;s a hole in my soul, Carson...</p></p><h2>People of the Lakes (The First North Americans series, Book 6)</h2><p><p>Clan fighting over a powerful totemic mask has brought the Mound Builder people of the Great Lakes region to the edge of destruction.

His name was Green Spider, but now he looked more like a plucked bird than a spider. His arms stuck out like wings, his legs were close together. He might have been dead, so limp did he lie.Only on close inspection could the faint rise and fall of his bony back be detected. Smooth, coppery skin sparkled with beads of sweat. Arching from the middle of each shoulder blade across to the collarbone, three deep cuts marred his flesh. The blood--an offering to the Spirit World--had trickled down the strips of muscle and bone that composed his sapling-thin body. A bone skewer, split from a deer's cannon bone and ground sharp on both ends, pinned the tight bun of thick black hair in place at the base of his skull. He looked young, no more than twenty-five winters in age.Despite the awkward angle of his head, part of his face could be seen. Broad cheekbones accented a high brow, and the nose appeared narrow and hooked, like a raptor's beak. Thin shells--each delicately carved into the shape of a spider and dyed bright green--dangled from the lobes of his ears.For four long days--deprived of food, sleep, and water--he'd lain thus: sweating, praying, falling into the hole in his soul, seeking, seeking ...... and the Vision had begun to form, that of flight ... sailing ... twisting on the predawn currents of cloud and wind.&nbsp;<br>Far below, the earth waited, gray and somber, locked in the grip of winter. Patches of ice-crusted snow molded around the boles of trees and contoured the mottled yellow-brown leaf mat of the oak-hickory forest.His strangely acute sight located the winding course of theFather Water and followed the familiar sinuous shape to the mouth of the Deer River, then turned eastward, up toward the divide. Nestled in clearings, small thatched huts clustered, awaiting the winter solstice sunrise.There, along the north bank of the Deer River, blocky earthen mounds had been constructed on the high terraces above the swampy bottoms. Some--centrally placed--rose higher than the trees and had an unbroken view of the distant horizon. Each capped with yellow sand, they glistened in the predawn light. Other earthen mounds had been placed along the solstice and equinox lines that radiated out from the towering central mound. These were rectangular, and capped with white sand in preparation for the Dances and offerings. Yet other mounds, smaller and rounded, bore the bones and ashes of the Dead. These mounds had been placed along the lines of the constellations.<i>"Do you know this place?"</i> a voice asked from the hazy gray distance."The City of the Dead."The humped shapes of charnel houses clustered in the flats between the mounds. Young trees had been harvested for their construction, the butts placed in postholes and bent to stress the wood into firm bows before saplings were woven into the framework and lashed together. The whole had been covered by tightly laced shocks of grass.On this special day, the Spirits of the Dead waited, already anxious and hungry for the feast in their honor.<i>"I am giving you a special gift,"</i> the voice told him. <i>"I will let you see through my eyes ... the eyes of Many Colored Crow."</i>And the sense of flight changed, altered, gaining Power and the memory of times long past and places far away. Green Spider circled, drawing the clouds around him like a thick cocoon. In one scaled foot he clutched the Power of lightning, ready to strike. With his keen Spirit Vision, he studied the scene below."Many Colored Crow?"<i>"I have heard you crying for a Vision."</i>"But I ... it's so ..."<i>"Look down! Observe. This is one of the two holiest days of the year."</i>Despite the sullen cold of winter, people had braved the chill to journey from isolated farmsteads or from the loose aggregatesof oblong houses where they gardened, hunted, and gathered food during the year. From as far away as a six-day walk, they had converged on the mound center of the City of the Dead. They came wrapped in blankets, their feet bound to shield them from the crusted snow. Their backs were bowed, burdened by pots full of food, offerings, or the ashes of those who had died during the preceding year. Some had come along the rivers, paddling canoes through the icy waters of still swamps and meandering streams.People congregated here four times a year, on the solstices and equinoxes. Some came to bury their Dead, others to honor their ancestors, to bring them food or gifts--to remind the Dead that the living remembered and cherished them. To beg for help in the coming year.Still others came for the feasting and dancing, for on this winter solstice, the shamans would welcome the new year and invite Father Sun to begin his trip northward. Observances would be kept, and sacred artifacts would be cleaned, their Spirits ritually fed and cared for before being stowed in receptacles within the temple buildings.The ceremonial societies would Dance and perform the rituals that would ensure a good year for all. The young who sought initiation would be tested. Those who passed the ordeals would be accepted into the secrets of their societies. The structures and enclosures within which these events occurred would be inspected and plans laid for their upkeep. The sacred grounds of the City of the Dead would be policed, and invading saplings chopped out.During the four days of the ceremonies, clans conducted most of their business. The female clan leaders would decide which crops would be planted in spring. Fields needed to be rotated and farmsteads moved. Hours would be spent in serious council regarding soils, seed crops, and where the forests should be cleared. Internal matters would be dealt with: disputes settled, marriages negotiated, and in some cases, divorces granted."Will this Vision give me the Power to call the storms? To control nature and people?"<i>"No, Green Spider. You seek order, and you will find only Truth. Look at them. See the people? You will never see them the same way again."</i>As Green Spider gazed down from above, most of those people slept. He turned his attention to the long, thatched temple that stood just south of the highest mound in the central group. There, five men remained awake despite the hour.Four old men, the Clan Elders, sat inside the temple. They hunched like shriveled toads as they watched a naked young man prone on the floor."Me ... that's me!" Green Spider's senseless body still lay facedown on the mat-covered floor. How pitiful his flesh looked, inert, little more than warm clay.<i>"Yes, you ... as you were. Who are those old men who watch you so? Is their faith in you justified?"</i>"They are the Clan Elders, the old men who see to the rituals. They are the Spiritual guardians of my people."Green Spider studied the familiar Clan Elders. Summer suns and winter winds had deepened and enriched those walnut complexions with a patina of age. Copper ear spools hung from stretched earlobes, and the wrinkles camouflaged faded tattoos. Mouths puckered around toothless jaws, but their eyes remained bright, sharply focused on Green Spider's inert body.They wore long winter coats, fringed shawls, and fur-lined moccasins that rose to mid-calf. The cloth, woven from processed nettle and milkweed, had been spun into the finest of fibers before master weavers had strung thread over loom. Great artistry had gone into the weaving, and intricate patterns decorated the carefully dyed cloth. The color represented each Elder's clan affiliation.The Red Bloods were the clan of the east; to them, the color red was sacred. They dyed it into the stunning fabrics they specialized in producing, and painted it on their bodies for the ceremonials. Blood represented the Power of life that was shared by all living things. With it, the clans renewed the fields in spring and painted themselves after a successful hunt to thank the Spirits of the animals upon which they depended. Old Man Blood carried a conch shell, the symbol of his office.The Sun Clan held the bench along the south wall and wore the color yellow--symbolizing Father Sun and the life he brought to all living things. This clan maintained the sacred fires in the temples and lit them in the surrounding clan houses for the seasonal rituals. The Sun Clan carried burning brands whennew fields were to be cleared or old ones retired, for fire cleansed. Old Man Sun carried fire sticks.The western bench represented the Sky Clan, who donned blue for their sacred rituals. Blue was the color of water as well as the sky, for the two were interrelated. The sky provided rain for the fields and replenished the rivers for the fish, turtles, and waterfowl. Blue was the color of renewal. Old Man Sky carried a small jar of water.The northern bench belonged to the Winter Clan, and their color was black, that of war, the hunt, and the winter storms. For what good were blood, sun, sky, and water without courage, strength, and death? Life could not exist without death, nor could the day without the night. All things--be they yearly cycles or lifetimes--must eventually end. And from endings came new beginnings. Old Man North had rattles--crafted from sections of human skulls--tied to his knees so that each step he took rattled the passing of time and the inevitability of death,Had it not always been so?"I will be strong enough." Green Spider's soul chilled. Strong enough for what?<i>"Before I grant you what you seek, I must test you,"</i> the voice of Many Colored Crow told him. <i>"Can you fulfill the needs of Power?"</i>All of Green Spider's life, he'd prepared himself to be a Dreamer. He could always sense Power just bey...</p><h2>GONE FISHIN: Featuring an Original Easy Rawlins Short Story &#34;Smoke&#34;</h2><p>Everything Easy Rawlins and Mouse Alexander know about friendship, and themselves, comes apart at the seams when they enter a steamy bayou world of voodoo, sex, revenge, and death. Reprint.</p><p><b>Gone Fishin'</b> actually marks the first appearance of Ezekiel "Easy" Rawlins, as well as his homicide-prone sidekick Raymond "Mouse" Alexander. But the story takes place in 1939, when both protagonists are still living in Houston. This is no tightly plotted mystery, but an atmospheric coming-of-age story, which gives the reluctant Easy an education in sex and death, family and forgiveness. As always, Mosley's prose is a marvel: musical, funny, and full of no-frills lyricism. And the unfolding of Easy's character is every bit as gripping as the breakneck plotting of the later installment.Walter Mosley is the author of five Easy Rawlins mysteries: <i>Devil in A Blue Dress</i>, <i>A Red Death</i>, <i>White Butterfly</i>, <i>Black Betty</i> and <i>A Little Yellow Dog</i>; three non-mystery novels, <i>Blue Light</i>, <i>Gone Fishin'</i>, and <i>R. L.'s Dream</i>; two collections of stories featuring Socrates Fortlow, <i>Always Outnumbered, Always Outgunned</i>, for which he received the Anisfield Wolf Award, and which was an HBO movie, and a nonfiction book, <i>Workin' On The Chain Gang</i>.

Tour.</p><p>One of Scott Hamilton's early skating coaches had an ironclad rule: If you fall during a routine, you bounce back up and skate on, smiling. This habit of tenaciousness not only helped Hamilton win Olympic Gold, but kept him going through a chronic childhood illness and, recently, an episode of cancer. His fast-paced memoir will appeal to even the most casual fans of competitive skating. Since Hamilton does TV sports commentary and is comfortable with a microphone, and since so many are familiar with his voice, this is one autobiography that could benefit from being read by the author. Doug Ordunio's reading is satisfactory though. His pace is good and his emotional coloring tastefully modulated. S.P. � AudioFile 2000, Portland, Maine-- <i>Copyright � AudioFile, Portland, Maine</i>Readers seeking a peek at the world of competitive figure skating will be more than satisfied with Hamilton's book. Like Peggy Fleming (see above), Hamilton is a cancer survivor. He opens his story with the diagnosis of his testicular cancer, but the illness is just one aspect of Hamilton's difficult but ultimately satisfying life. An adopted child, Hamilton was quite ill as a child and spent much of his early years in and out of hospitals, on intravenous feedings, weak and falling behind in school. Gradually, as Hamilton gained strength, his mother suggested he try to ice skate. Whether Hamilton's various illnesses had run their course or the skating cured him, Hamilton was healthy enough to pursue skating. His route to the Olympics is familiar to skating fansAliving away from home with other families, constant practice sessions and the nervous tension and rivalries. Hamilton is far more willing than Fleming to write about his relationships with other skaters and his feelings about the skating world. He addresses the confusion over his sexuality: "Frankly I was sick of people constantly assuming I was gay because I was a figure skater." Hamilton also writes about how critical reviewers were of his early appearances as a skating commentator and how he finally had to do the best he could rather than try to measure up to one of his idols, Dick Button. A little more brassy than Fleming, Hamilton strikes a nice balance between the personal and the professional.

The other half, who had received placebo surgery, felt their last hope dissolve into bitter frustration. But the hardest road lay ahead for those who had been given the highly experimental procedure. <i>Healing the Brain</i> captures the emotional events that unfolded in the months afterward as Freed, his researchers, and their courageous, desperate patients awaited the outcome and witnessed a moral debate unfolding across the nation over embryonic stem-cell medicine. Would the brain regenerate itself or reject the new cells? This pioneering team was willing to take perilous risks to find out.<br><br><i>Healing the Brain</i> is a moving, fascinating narrative about discovery and disillusionment, conflict and compassion, suffering and -- for some -- amazing success.<br></p><p>Convinced that drug therapies based on dopamine replacement would never fully relieve the symptoms of Parkinson's disease, Dr. Curt Freed instead cut to the core of the matter--quite literally--and explored ways to replace damaged neurological systems caused by the disease. <i>Healing the Brain</i> meticulously chronicles his development and testing of a controversial surgical method, in which microscopic "noodles" of fetal brain tissue were implanted in the brains of suffering patients. <p> Fueled by major funding from the National Institutes of Health, Freed conducted the first double-blind fetal cell transplant study--a project involving 40 patients and spanning an unexpected five years (1994-1999). He hoped to show that such transplants would help the brain heal by repairing critical pathways that appear damaged in Parkinson's patients. </p><p> To some degree, he succeeded. Throughout this vivid account, Freed and coauthor Simon LeVay carefully outline the history of Parkinson's, treatment successes and failures, and all the players (patients, politicians, and fellow researchers) in Freed's fight against this progressively degenerative disease. While most of the text reads easily, the surgical accounts will challenge queasy stomachs; every action and reaction (by patient, doctor, and equipment) is recorded here. Most compelling, however, is Freed's insight into the disease itself and his confidence that science eventually will provide a cure. <i>--Liane Emory Thomas</i></p>Curt Freed, M.D., is the director of the neuroscience and neurotransplant programs at the University of Colorado and the director of the National Parkinson Foundation Center of Excellence.

His patients are challenged by life-threatening drug addictions, mental illness, Hepatitis C or HIV and, in many cases, all four. But if Dr. Mat�&#x2019;s patients are at the far end of the spectrum, there are many others among us who are also struggling with addictions. Drugs, alcohol, tobacco, work, food, sex, gambling and excessive inappropriate spending: what is amiss with our lives that we seek such self-destructive ways to comfort ourselves? And why is it so difficult to stop these habits, even as they threaten our health, jeopardize our relationships and corrode our lives?<br><br>Beginning with a dramatically close view of his drug addicted patients, Dr. Mat� looks at his own history of compulsive behaviour. He weaves the stories of real people who have struggled with addiction with the latest research on addiction and the brain. Providing a bold synthesis of clinical experience, insight and cutting edge scientific findings, Dr. Mat� sheds light on this most puzzling of human frailties. He proposes a compassionate approach to helping drug addicts and, for the many behaviour addicts among us, to addressing the void addiction is meant to fill.<br><br><i>I believe there is one addiction process, whether it manifests in the lethal substance dependencies of my Downtown Eastside patients, the frantic self-soothing of overeaters or shopaholics, the obsessions of gamblers, sexaholics and compulsive internet users, or in the socially acceptable and even admired behaviours of the workaholic. Drug addicts are often dismissed and discounted as unworthy of empathy and respect. In telling their stories my intent is to help their voices to be heard and to shed light on the origins and nature of their ill-fated struggle to overcome suffering through substance use. Both in their flaws and their virtues they share much in common with the society that ostracizes them. If they have chosen a path to nowhere, they still have much to teach the rest of us. In the dark mirror of their lives we can trace outlines of our own.<br></i>&#x2014;<i>from <b>In the Realm of Hungry Ghosts</b></i></p><p>He would probably dispute it, but Gabor Mat� is something of a compassion machine. Diligently treating the drug addicts of Vancouver's notorious Downtown Eastside with sympathy in his heart and legislative reform in mind can't be easy. But Mat� never judges. His book is a powerful call-to-arms, both for the decriminalization of drugs and for a more sympathetic and informed view of addiction. As Mat� observes, "Those whom we dismiss as 'junkies' are not creatures from a different world, only men and women mired at the extreme end of a continuum on which, here or there, all of us might well locate ourselves." <i>In the Realm of Hungry Ghosts</i> begins by introducing us to many of Dr. Mat�'s most dire patients who steal, cheat, sell sex, and otherwise harm themselves for their next hit. Mat� looks to the root causes of addiction, applying a clinical and psychological view to the physical manifestation and offering some enlightening answers for why people inflict such c! atastrophe on themselves.<p></p>Finally, he takes aim at the hugely ineffectual, largely U.S.-led War on Drugs (and its worldwide followers), challenging the wisdom of fighting drugs instead of aiding the addicts, and showing how controversial measures such as safe injection sites are measurably more successful at reducing drug-related crime and the spread of disease than anything most major governments have going. It's not easy reading, but we ignore his arguments at our peril. When it comes to combating the drug trade and the ravages of addiction, society can use all the help it can get. <i>--Kim Hughes</i>Gabor Mat�, M.D. is the author of the bestselling books <b>Scattered Minds</b> and <b>When the Body Says No</b>&#x2013;published in ten languages on five continents&#x2013;and co-author, with Gordon Neufeld, of <b>Hold On To Your Kids</b>.

Her fortieth high school reunion, the last one, is one week away, and she&#x2019;s trying to decide whether or not to draw a beauty mark above her lip for the occasion. It wouldn&#x2019;t be entirely false; she does have a mole there, but it&#x2019;s faint, hard to see. She just wants to enhance what already exists, nothing wrong with that; it&#x2019;s de rigueur if you&#x2019;re a woman, and it&#x2019;s becoming more common in men, too. Wrong as that is. Dorothy would never have anything to do with a man who wore makeup or dyed his hair or carried a purse or wore support hose or cried or did any of those womanly things men are appropriating as though it&#x2019;s their god-given right. No. She prefers an all-American, red-blooded male who is not a jerk. They&#x2019;re hard to find, but she holds out hope that she will have some sort of meaningful relationship with one before she&#x2019;s six feet under.<br><br>She regards herself in the mirror, tilts her head this way and that. Yes, a beauty mark would be fun, kind of playful. She pencils in the mark gingerly, then steps back to regard herself. Not bad. Not bad at all. Sexy. Just like she wanted. Helloooo, Marilyn. She pictures Pete Decker looking up from his table full of jocks when she walks into the hotel ballroom and saying, Va va va voom! And then, Dorothy? Dorothy Shauman?<br><br>&#x201c;Uh-huh,&#x201d; she will say, lightly, musically, and walk right past him. Though she will walk close enough to him for him to smell her perfume. Also new. One hundred and ten smackeroos. She got perfume, not cologne, even though her personal belief is that there is no difference. She&#x2019;d asked the counter woman about that. She&#x2019;d leaned in confidentially and said, &#x201c;Now, come on. Tell me, really. If you were my best friend, would you tell me to get the perfume over the cologne?&#x201d; And the woman had looked her right in the eye and said, &#x201c;Yes.&#x201d; Dorothy was a little miffed, because the woman had acted as though Dorothy had affronted her dignity or questioned her ethics or something. Like the time Dr. Strickland was telling Dorothy to get a certain ($418!!!) blood test and she&#x2019;d said, &#x201c;Would you tell your wife to get it?&#x201d; And Dr. Strickland had drawn himself up and quietly said, &#x201c;I would.&#x201d; Dorothy had been all set to give him an affectionate little punch and say, &#x201c;Oh, come on, now; don&#x2019;t be so prissy,&#x201d; but then Dr. Strickland had added, &#x201c;If she were still alive,&#x201d; and that had just ruined everything. It wasn&#x2019;t her fault the woman had died! Dorothy had been going to refuse the test no matter what, but when he said his wife was dead, well, then she had to get it. Those dead people had more power than they thought.<br><br>Dorothy has never gone to a high school reunion. She&#x2019;d been married when they had them before, and who wanted to bring that to a reunion. Now she is divorced, plus she saw that movie about saying yes to life. She steps closer to the mirror and raises her chin so her turkey neck disappears. She&#x2019;ll hold her head like this when she walks by Pete Decker. Later, when they&#x2019;re making out in his car, it will be dark, and she won&#x2019;t have to be so vigilant. Oh, she hopes he drives to the reunion; she happens to know he lives a mere three and a half hours away. She knows his exact address, in fact; and she Google-Earthed him, which was very exciting.<br><br>In high school, Pete had a four-on-the-floor, metallic green GTO, and Dorothy always wanted to make out with him in that car. But she never even got to sit in it. She bets he has something like a red Lexus coupe now. And she bets that at the reunion he&#x2019;ll watch her for a while, then come up to her and say, &#x201c;Hey, Dots. Want to take a walk?&#x201d; And she&#x2019;ll say, all innocent, &#x201c;Where?&#x201d; And he&#x2019;ll get a little flustered and say something like &#x201c;You know, just a walk, get some air.&#x201d; She&#x2019;ll hesitate just for a second, just long enough to make him think she might refuse, and then she&#x2019;ll shrug prettily before she agrees to accompany him outside. They&#x2019;ll go right to his car and he&#x2019;ll open the passenger-side door and raise an eyebrow and she&#x2019;ll say, &#x201c;Pete!&#x201d; like she&#x2019;s offended at the very notion. But then she&#x2019;ll get in, will she ever. She likes this part of the fantasy best: She&#x2019;ll get in, he&#x2019;ll come around and get in on his side, and then, just before he lunges at her, he&#x2019;ll look at her with smoke practically coming out of his eyes. And in her eyes, a soft Yes, I know. I, too, have wanted this for years.<br><br>Dorothy does plan on being a little mean to Pete at first; she has finally learned it can be a good thing to be mean to men. Apparently they like it; it&#x2019;s supposed to appeal to their hunting instinct. That&#x2019;s why she&#x2019;s going to walk right by him when he first sees her and notices how attractive she is. Considering.<br><br>Her daughter, Hilly, is the one who told her about being mean to men. She said you do it just at the beginning and then every so often, just to keep up a level of intrigue, like immunization shots. And it works, too, because when Hilly started doing it, wasn&#x2019;t she engaged in what seemed like ten minutes! She&#x2019;s getting married in Costa Rica next month, and Dorothy thinks it&#x2019;s a wonderful idea, the destination wedding. Thank God Dorothy&#x2019;s ex will pay for everything. Poor he was not. She supposes he&#x2019;ll bring his new wife to the wedding, and pander to her every single second. Holding her hand, as though they were teenagers. Bringing her drinks, as though the woman is incapable of doing anything for herself. Staring into her eyes like the secret of the universe is written there. It&#x2019;s nauseating, the way they behave, anyone would say so. Hilly calls them the Magnets, though she might only do that to offer some kind of support to her mother, who lives alone now and must take out the garbage and figure out whom to call for repairs and check the locks at night and kill centipedes in the basement and everything else. Dorothy suspects the truth is, Hilly actually likes her stepmother. She hasn&#x2019;t said so directly, but she did say that she&#x2019;s happy for her dad, and wasn&#x2019;t that just like nails on a chalkboard. But Dorothy did the noble thing and said yes, she was, too. Uh-huh, yes, he did seem happy now, Dorothy said, and she just wanted to throw up.<br><br>Hilly&#x2019;s fianc� is a doctor. A proctologist, specializing in the wonderful world of buttholes and rectums, but still. Dorothy is working up to asking the question that&#x2014;come on!&#x2014;must occur to everyone to ask him: What exactly made you choose this line of work? When Dorothy tried to ask her daughter about it, all Hilly did was get mad. It is true Dorothy could have used a more sensitive approach&#x2014;what she&#x2019;d asked Hilly was &#x201c;Why in the wide, wide world would you ever want to look up people&#x2019;s heinies all day?&#x201d; Still, Dorothy doesn&#x2019;t see why Hilly had to take such offense. Her daughter had said something like perhaps Dorothy should consider the fact that preventing and treating cancer is a pretty noble goal. But that still didn&#x2019;t answer the question, did it?<br><br>Dorothy thinks it was a book her daughter read that taught her about being mean to men. Who knows, if Dorothy had been mean to Pete Decker in high school, they might have gotten married. They went out once&#x2014;well, not a date technically, but they did spend some time together on the class trip to Washington, D.C., and Dorothy was awfully nice to Pete and then of course that was that, he never called her. But if they had gotten married, they probably would have gotten divorced, and then she wouldn&#x2019;t be looking forward so much to going to her high school reunion. Apart from her friends Linda Studemann and Judy Holt, she&#x2019;s really only going to see him. And, to be honest, to show off her recent weight loss. That was the one nice thing about her divorce: During the grief part, before she realized how much better off she was without her husband, she lost twenty-three pounds. She bets she&#x2019;ll look better than the cheerleaders, and even better than Candy Sullivan, who had been queen of everything. Not that Candy Sullivan is coming. According to Pam Pottsman, who is the contact person for this year&#x2019;s reunion, Candy came to the five-year reunion and hasn&#x2019;t come to any since. &#x201c;Is she dead?&#x201d; Dorothy asked, ready to offer an impromptu eulogy praising Candy&#x2019;s good points, even though Candy never gave Dorothy the time of day. But Pam said no, Candy wasn&#x2019;t dead, apparently she just thought she was too good to come, and then they both started talking about what a snob Candy always was, and she wasn&#x2019;t even really all that hot. &#x201c;Did you know she stuffed her bra?&#x201d; Pam said, and Dorothy said, &#x201c;Really?&#x201d; and felt that delicious rush, and Pam said, &#x201c;Yup, I sat across from her in Mr. Simon&#x2019;s psychology class and I saw Kleenex coming out of the top of her blouse one day and I whispered to her that it was showing and she got all embarrassed and stuffed it back in and wouldn&#x2019;t look at me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But wait a minute,&#x201d; Dorothy said. &#x201c;I saw her naked in gym class, and she didn&#x2019;t need any Kleenex.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What year?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Senior. And she did not need Kleenex.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, that psychology class was sophomore year,&#x201d; Pam said, and she sounded a little disappointed that Candy Sullivan had outgrown her need for bra stuffing. But then she told Dorothy how a lot more people were coming this year than ever before, probably because it was the last reunion their class was going to have; and she named several of their classmates who had signed up. Dorothy thinks it will be fun to see poo...</p><h2>Everglades (Doc Ford)</h2><p>Meeting a former lover whose real-estate husband has disappeared and been pronounced dead, Doc Ford investigates the woman&#39;s suspicions of foul play and finds himself deep in the Everglades, where a big business owner is hatching a scheme to promote his cash flow and personal power. 40,000 first printing.</p><p>Randy Wayne White is the author of seventeen previous Doc Ford novels and four collections of nonfiction. He lives in an old house built on an Indian mound in Pineland, Florida.Doc Ford, marine biologist and sometime intelligence agent, is wallowing in depression, drinking too much, not exercising, and doing too much thinking. Then Sally Minster, an old friend comes to him for help; her husband has disappeared, and she refuses to believe he's dead. Thus begins a tale of cult religion, real estate schemes, and murder in the Florida Everglades. Dick Hill's staccato rhythm and tempo give great advantage to the story's action scenes. Using distinguishing voices that are easy to identify, he portrays a spectrum of characters and delivers sighs, laughter, and other emotions naturally. While there are many long introspective passages that Hill could have read more smoothly--his delivery works much better with the dialogue--all in all this is a good performance.

No one knows if he ever succeeded, though, as all trace of Albrek and his followers simply vanished from history. Now, however, the dwarves must find the magical talisman that Albrek carried with him before their mines run dry, which would threaten the livelihood of the entire dwarf realm. And so the newly named wizard Alexander Taylor joins a familiar company of adventurers on a quest to discover what happened to Albrek, find his mythical tomb, and locate the lost talisman. Discovering Albrek s fate, however, may be the least of the adventurers problems when they cross paths with an ancient, wandering paladin who has a taste for confrontation and a paranoid belief that some great evil is working in all of the known lands.

One of the most tragic and mysterious of nineteenth-century figures, Mary Lincoln and her story symbolize the pain and loss of Civil War America. Authoritative and utterly engrossing, <i>Mrs. Lincoln</i> is the long-awaited portrait of the woman who so richly contributed to Lincoln's life and legacy. </p></p><p><b>Book Description</b><p> Abraham Lincoln is the most revered president in American history, but the woman at the center of his life, his wife, Mary, has remained a historical enigma. In this definitive, magisterial biography, Catherine Clinton draws on important new research to illuminate the remarkable life of Mary Lincoln, and at a time when the nation was being tested as never before. </p> <p> Mary Lincoln's story is inextricably tied with the story of America and with her husband's presidency, yet her life is an extraordinary chronicle on its own. Born into an aristocratic Kentucky family, she was an educated, well-connected Southern daughter, and when she married a Springfield lawyer she became a Northern wife&#x2014;an experience mirrored by thousands of her countrywomen. The Lincolns endured many personal setbacks&#x2014;including the death of a child and defeats in two U.S. Senate races&#x2014;along the road to the White House. Mrs. Lincoln herself suffered scorching press attacks, but remained faithful to the Union and her wartime husband. She was also the first presidential wife known as the "First Lady," and it was in this role that she gained her lasting fame. The assassination of her husband haunted her for the rest of her life. Her disintegrating downward spiral resulted in a brief but traumatizing involuntary incarceration in an asylum and exile in Europe during her later years. One of the most tragic and mysterious of nineteenth-century figures, Mary Lincoln and her story symbolize the pain and loss of Civil War America. </p> <p> Authoritative and utterly engrossing, <i>Mrs. Lincoln</i> is the long-awaited portrait of the woman who so richly contributed to Lincoln's life and legacy. </p> <p> <strong>Questions for Catherine Clinton </strong> </p><p> <b>Q: Why did you decide to write about Mrs. Lincoln in this book?</b><br> <b>A: </b> Of course, it was a daunting task to take on this project in the wake of so much new information on Lincoln and his world, and with the Lincoln Bicentennial looming on the horizon. But I knew that Mary Lincoln was being lost in the shuffle of the new Lincoln literature. With an outpouring of new work on Abraham Lincoln every year it's been over twenty years since the last biography of Mary. When it was written, we did not have the cache of new letters (uncovered by Jason Emerson) which showed Mary&#x2019;s state of mind during her incarceration. We also did not have the past quarter century of Civil War scholarship which has contextualized and expanded our appreciation of what it truly meant when families were divided by war.<br><br> <b>Q: Was Lincoln&#x2019;s wife a southern sympathizer?</b><br> <b>A:</b> No, and this is one of the misconceptions I hope to counter in my study, although I do portray her as a daughter of the Bluegrass, and brought up to be a proper southern lady. However, she had always been unconventional--temperamental, articulate, not only better read than her husband (and conversing with diplomats on state occasions in French) but she had more than ten years of formal education. She also became a partisan abolitionist when he befriended Charles Sumner, and was opposed to anyone who advocated disunion. At the same time, when Elmer Ellsworth, the war&#x2019;s first casualty--shot while tearing down a rebel flag in Virginia in May 1861--was killed, his murderer was shot dead--a brother of a Dr. Jackson from her hometown of Lexington. So in this first armed encounter when Virginia seceded, the Lincolns mourned Ellsworth&#x2019;s passing, but Mrs. Lincoln could appreciate as well the sorrow of the Jacksons in Kentucky at losing a brother, a son, and the fratricidal nature of the conflict.<br><br> <b>Q: So were the Lincolns racist as some modern critics have suggested?</b><br> <b>A:</b> I think both Abraham and Mary reflected the prejudices of their era, but not only the wealth of new work on race and gender over the past few decades has informed my approach in Mrs. Lincoln, but some of the real, human aspects of life in the White House were new to me.<br><br> <b>Q: How so?</b><br> <b>A:</b> Mary Lincoln&#x2019;s relationship with the black women who were a part of the White House staff, as well as her crucial relationship with Elizabeth Keckly (whose biography appeared in 2003) needed a fresh approach. I used memoirs and interview material drawn from the lives of those who knew the Lincolns in the White House. I was especially impressed to discover that Abraham Lincoln, who doted on his sons, had taken his son Tad to the Slade house on Massachusetts Ave. N.W., where he might play with the African American children of his father&#x2019;s trusted aide, William Slade. So it was really these kind of details that I hope will bring both the Lincolns to life.<br><br> <b>Q: A lot of people want to know if Mrs. Lincoln was crazy?</b><br> <b>A:</b> My degrees from Harvard and Princeton are not in medicine--so I cannot diagnose. I can say that I felt she did deteriorate mentally during her time in the White House and my study attempts to place into context some of her challenges and failings. But I also wanted to show her relationship with the press, her relationship with her children, and especially the many trials she faced as a widow...which is why I begin the book with Lincoln&#x2019;s assassination as the defining moment of her life.<br><br> <b>Q: Do you think Mary Lincoln could give any advice to Michelle Obama?</b><br> <b>A:</b> Many of Lincoln&#x2019;s critics went after his wife to get at him--using the folk wisdom, if you want to destroy a house, set fire to the thatch. The wife of our 44th President has shown wit and humor and intellect that mirrors perhaps many attributes Mary Lincoln brought to the White House, but Michelle Obama has advantages that Mrs. Lincoln did not have. But the one thing I think the campaign has already taught our newest occupant of the White House is to not let those who hang on her every word and focus on fashion define her.</p><p>Catherine Clinton is the author of <em>Harriet Tubman: The Road to Freedom</em> and <em>Fanny Kemble's Civil Wars</em>.

Yet the rich, vivid, and romantic story of Marya Salome Sklodwska-the young Polish national who discovered radioactivity-has been lost to time . . . until now, in the pages of this stunning, wildly creative, and uniquely moving visual biography by one of the most creative artistic talents working today. Lauren Redniss, a celebrated New York Times illustrator and storyteller, has thrown herself deeply and passionately into researching the story of the real Marie Curie; of her passionate and tragic romantic life; and of the century of scientific innovation and controversy that sprang from her discovery of radium and went on to change the course of world history. Drawing on her original archival research in Europe and the United States - and a host of new interviews with Curie family members and scientists who carry on the Curie tradition - Redniss has created a fascinating and deeply moving book. A visually stunning work of illustrative art, Radioactive walks the reader through the story of Curie&#39;s own life, which was marked by both extraordinary scientific discovery and dramatic personal trauma - from her romantic partnership with Pierre, through his tragic decline from radium poisoning and death in a traffic accident, to the scandalous affair with another fellow scientist that almost cost her her second Nobel Prize. But it also casts an eye forward, to survey the changes wrought by Curie&#39;s discovery of radioactivity - illuminating the path from the Curie laboratory past the bright red mushroom clouds in the Nevada desert through Three Mile Island and the advance in radiation therapy and nuclear power today. Whether young or old, scientific novice or expert, no one will fail to be moved by Lauren Redniss&#39;s eerie and wondrous evocation of one of history&#39;s most intriguing figures.</p><p></p><h2>OTHER LOSSES: The Shocking Truth Behind the Mass Deaths of Disarmed German Soldiers and Civilians Under General Eisenhower&#39;s Command</h2><p>Holds Eisenhower responsible for the deaths of tens of thousands of unarmed Germans in prison camps at World War II&#39;s end</p><p>Canadian writer Bacque's shocking and controversial account of American mistreatment of four million German WW II POWs. Centering on American idol Dwight D. Eisenhower, Bacque's indictment strikes to the heart of the American dream, charging us with much the same kind of brutality that so incenses Americans when practiced by foreigners--allowing POWs to die by the tens of thousands from disease and starvation. In a skillfully organized, meticulously documented brief (86 pages of notes and appendices), Bacque charges Eisenhower not with neglect but with setting policy- -and charges subsequent authorities with a methodical cover-up, including destruction of evidence. The narrative is strongly detailed, beginning with an old Frenchman, accompanied by Bacque, opening an ancient, dusty box to find--nothing: missing evidence. From there we have a real-life thriller, complete with security forces bullying aged witnesses. Surprises are nonstop, beginning with a damning introduction by respected military historian Ernest F. Fisher, Jr., who speaks of Eisenhower's ``fierce and obsessive hatred of...all things German.'' There follows a jolting indictment of high American figures, starting at the top. The tone is set when Churchill walks out of a Big Three meeting as Roosevelt jokes with Stalin (recent perpetrator of the notorious Katyn Forest massacre) about exterminating prisoners. The point is driven home a thousand ways, most effectively in the knowledgeable analysis of Eisenhower's management style, which allowed subordinates to carry out policy with little paper to back them up. The general who sends military aircraft to pick up oranges for breakfast while prisoners are starving is especially memorable. Even more so is the repeated British refusal to countenance the US policy in principle and detail. Explosive and deeply iconoclastic, this book is sure to enrage many. Refutations without research as painstaking as Bacque's will lack credence. -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

How do we know when to pursue medical interventions and when to allow our loved ones to, as Dr. Butler puts it, &#x2018;relax into the embrace of Jesus&#x2019;? These are complex questions without easy answers. But <i>Between Life and Death</i> provides a helpful framework of biblical wisdom to illuminate otherwise murky scenarios. Dr. Butler explains the dense medical terminology that can baffle already-overwhelmed caregivers. And, with unflinching (but not unsympathetic) clarity, she brings us to the bedsides of the suffering and tells us what it is like to experience CPR, a ventilator, or artificially administered nutrition. The actual impact and likely outcome of such treatments is far from the glamorous glow of TV medical dramas, but we need to know the stark reality in order to make God-honoring and merciful choices for ourselves and our loved ones. Thankfully, this book also has an expiration date. One day, gathered in the near presence of Christ, we will no longer need to know how to make decisions about death. But in the meantime, I&#x2019;m glad to have this book on my shelf.&#x201d; <br>&#x2015;<strong>Megan Hill</strong><strong>,</strong> author, <em>Praying Together</em> and <em>Contentment</em>; Editor, The Gospel Coalition</p><p>&#x201c;Dr. Butler has done a masterful job in giving us a clear and comprehensive guide to navigating the difficult and complex waters of end-of-life care. Although <i>Between Life and Death</i> is written with patients and their families in mind, this book is a welcome and valuable resource for guiding Christian healthcare students through these challenging issues, in addition to providing the necessary biblical grounding and foundations.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Bill Reichart</strong><strong>,</strong> Vice President of Campus and Community Ministries, Christian Medical &amp; Dental Associations</p><p>&#x201c;For all the blessings of modern critical care, we have not sufficiently reckoned with its dark underside: what happens when medical technology and intervention do not preserve life but prolong death? With her keen medical training and experience on display, Dr. Kathryn Butler parts the curtain on an array of life-threatening situations that might befall us or those we love. In <i>Between Life and Death</i>, Dr. Butler points us to the hope of the gospel, showing what Christian discipleship might look like in some of the most agonizing moments in life. May this book serve as a useful guide and conversation starter as we prepare for death and gaze on Christ.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Ivan Mesa</strong><strong>,</strong> Books Editor, The Gospel Coalition</p><p>&#x201c;Dr. Kathryn Butler has taken her Christ-centered life as well as her experiences as a trauma surgeon to give the reader ways to assess end-of-life decisions to the glory of God in Christ Jesus. Her book emphasizes that we live by the grace of God in Christ Jesus. Dr. Butler has included numerous Bible references that are extremely helpful within the context of living and dying in Jesus Christ. It is a must-read for all Christians, church leaders, and medical professionals who are living through end-of-life dilemmas.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Bob Weise</strong><strong>,</strong> Professor Emeritus of Practical Theology, Concordia Seminary</p></p><h2>Wolfhunter River (Stillhouse Lake, 3)</h2><p><p><b>An Amazon Charts, <i>Wall Street Journal</i>, and <i>USA Today</i> bestseller.</b></p><p><b>She can&#x2019;t ignore a cry for help.

Wandering from town to town with just his horse, cart, and whatever wares have come his way, the peddler has pretty well settled into his routine-that is, until the night Lawrence finds a wolf goddess asleep in his cart. Taking the form of a fetching girl with wolf ears and a tail, Holo has wearied of tending to harvests in the countryside and strikes up a bargain with the merchant to lend him the cunning of &#39;Holo the Wisewolf&#39; to increase his profits in exchange for taking her along on his travels. What kind of businessman could turn down such an offer? Lawrence soon learns, though, that having an ancient goddess as a traveling companion can be a bit of a mixed blessing. Will this wolf girl turn out to be too wild to tame?</p><p>Isuna Hasekura&#39;s debut novel, SPICE AND WOLF, earned the Silver Prize in the 2005 Dengeki Novel Prize with the series going on to total seventeen novels and both manga and anime adaptations.</p><h2>Beyond Reason: Using Emotions as You Negotiate</h2><p><b><b>&#x201c;Written in the same remarkable vein as <i>Getting to Yes</i>, this book is a masterpiece.&#x201d; &#x2014;Dr. Steven R. Covey, author of <i>The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People</i><br><br></b>� Winner of the Outstanding Book Award for Excellence in Conflict Resolution from the International Institute for Conflict Prevention and Resolution �</b><br><br>In <i>Getting to Yes</i>, renowned educator and negotiator Roger Fisher presented a universally applicable method for effectively negotiating personal and professional disputes. Building on his work as director of the Harvard Negotiation Project, Fisher now teams with Harvard psychologist Daniel Shapiro,<i>&nbsp;</i>an expert on the emotional dimension of negotiation and author of&nbsp;<i>Negotiating the Nonnegotiable: How to Resolve Your Most Emotionally Charged Conflicts</i>. In <i>Beyond Reason</i>, Fisher and Shapiro show readers how to use emotions to turn a disagreement-big or small, professional or personal-into an opportunity for mutual gain.</p><p>Let's say you're trying to convince a new employer to sweeten its job offer to you. Or perhaps you're buying or selling a company. Or maybe you're even solving for peace in the Middle East. If any of these scenarios is yours, Roger Fisher, Daniel Shapiro, and their colleagues at the Harvard Negotiation Project have ideas that they would like to share. Fisher's previous book, <i>Getting to Yes</i>, stands today as a seminal work in negotiations theory. Businesspeople in a wide variety of industries have drawn from the book's tips for deal-making and its larger framework for "interest-based negotiation", which focuses on understanding each side's interests and working together to produce proverbial win-win outcomes. In <i>Beyond Reason</i>, Fisher and Shapiro go one step further. <p> To the authors' credit, they started this new book with a clear understanding of the previous one's chief shortcoming. Though <i>Getting to Yes</i> introduced a powerful paradigm for negotiations, it did not fully address a critical element of most deals: emotions, and the messy human details that can distract from purely rational decision-making. If both negotiators are consistently lucid, fair, and calm, the game has a certain set of rules, but if--as in most situations--the different parties get excited, angry, sad, insulted, and so on, then those rules change. That expanded focus forms the basis for <i>Beyond Reason</i>.</p> <p> Fisher and Shapiro have structured this latest work around five key emotions which they identify as most critical to productive negotiations. Even though each situation has its own dynamics, they point to <i>appreciation</i>, <i>affiliation</i>, <i>autonomy</i>, <i>status</i>, and <i>role</i> as the most important for making each party comfortable enough to grasp the principles of rationality that maximize the chances for a win-win result. </p> <p> Critics may deride this book as still too simplistic, too black-and-white, and unappreciative of life's shades of gray. The authors' pragmatic bent comes in the book's final two chapters. One takes readers through the overall process for negotiations--not just the parry-and-thrust of conversations with the other party, but also pre-conversation preparation. It's in this preparatory stage, the authors contend, where a thoughtful consideration of potential emotional dynamics can help prevent later problems. To synthesize many of the lessons they impart, Fisher and Shapiro then close their work by inviting guest commentary from the former President of Ecuador, Jamil Mahuad, who explains how he applied interest-based negotiations theory to highly charged negotiations between his country and Peru, on a border dispute in the late 1990s. It's this kind of real-life application of Fisher and Shapiro's theories that continue to give them relevance. <i>--Peter Han</i></p>Roger Fisher is the Samuel Williston Professor of Law Emeritus, Director of the Harvard Negotiation Project, and the founder of two consulting organizations devoted to strategic advice and negotiation training.<br><p>Daniel Shapiro, Associate Director of the Harvard Negotiation Project, teaches negotiation at Harvard Law School and in the psychiatry department at Harvard Medical School/McLean Hospital.</p></p><h2>The Fathers of the Church</h2><p>We hear the voices of the early Church Fathers even today.

For Melody Warnick, it was move #6, from Austin, Texas, to Blacksburg, Virginia, that threatened to unhinge her.

She also speaks with frequent movers and loyal stayers around the country to learn what draws highly mobile Americans to a new city, and what makes us stay.

Recognizing the practical results being received by themselves and by those people who were asking practical questions and then applying Abraham&#x2019;s answers to their own situations, Esther and Jerry made a deliberate decision to allow the teachings of Abraham to become available to an ever-widening circle of seekers of how to live a happier life. Using their San Antonio, Texas, conference center as their base, Jerry and Esther have traveled to approximately 50 cities a year since 1989, presenting interactive Law of Attraction workshops to those leaders who gather to participate in this expanding stream of progressive thought. And although worldwide attention has been given to this philosophy of Well-Being by Leading Edge thinkers and teachers who have, in turn, incorporated many of Abraham&#x2019;s Law of Attraction concepts into their best-selling books, scripts, lectures, and so forth, the primary spread of this material has been from person to person&#x2014;as individuals begin to discover the value of this form of spiritual practicality in their personal life experiences. In November 2011, Jerry made his transition into Non-Physical, and now Esther continues to conduct the Abraham workshops with the help of her physical friends and co-workers and, of course, with the Non-Physical help of Abraham and Jerry. People are able to access Abraham directly by attending the seminars in person or by participating in the online live streaming of most events. There is also an extensive YouTube library of Abraham videos. Abraham&#x2014;a group of uplifting Non-Physical teachers&#x2014;present their Broader Perspective through Esther Hicks.

James Popham</b> has spent the bulk of his educational career as a teacher. His first teaching assignment, for example, was in a small eastern Oregon high school where he taught English and social studies while serving as yearbook advisor, class sponsor, and unpaid tennis coach. The recompense meshed well with the quality of his coaching. <br> Most of Dr. Popham&#x2019;s teaching career took place at UCLA where, for nearly 30 years, he taught courses in instructional methods for prospective teachers as well as courses in evaluation and measurement for graduate students. At UCLA he won several distinguished teaching awards. In January 2000, he was recognized by UCLA Today as one of the university&#x2019;s top 20 professors of the twentieth century. (He notes that the twentieth century was a full-length century, unlike the current abbreviated one.) In 1992, he took early retirement from UCLA upon learning that emeritus professors received free parking. <br> Because at UCLA he was acutely aware of the perishability of professors who failed to publish, he spent his non-teaching hours affixing words to paper. The result: over 30 books, 200 journal articles, 50 research reports, and 175 papers presented before research societies. Although not noted in his official vita, while at UCLA he also authored 1,426 grocery lists. <br> His most recent books are<i> Transformative Assessment </i>(2008); <i>Instruction That Measures Up</i> (2009); <i>Transformative Assessment in Action</i> (2011); <i>Mastering Assessment </i>(2011, Pearson); <i>Unlearned Lessons</i> (2009, Harvard Education Press); <i>Everything School Leaders Need to Know About Assessment </i>(2010); and <i>Evaluating America&#x2019;s Teachers: Mission Possible? </i>(2013, Corwin). He encourages purchase of these books because he regards their semi-annual royalties as psychologically reassuring. <br> In 1968, Dr. Popham established IOX Assessment Associates, an R&amp;D group that formerly created statewide student achievement tests for a dozen states. He has personally passed all of those tests, largely because of his unlimited access to the tests&#x2019; answer keys.</p><h2>The Essential Lenormand: Your Guide to Precise &amp; Practical Fortunetelling</h2><p><p><strong>Master the keys of wisdom and insight</strong></p> <p>Lenormand is a 36-card deck with simple, straightforward illustrations that provide direct answers for the reader.

Now his face wears the mask of surprise that sometimes accompanies death: his eyes bulge, carp-like, and his mouth curves around a profanity.</p><p>Does killing a man who tried to rape me count as murder? For me, it probably does. The law in Missouri in this year of our Lord 1849 does not sympathize with a Chinaman&#x2019;s daughter.</p><p>I shake out my hand but can&#x2019;t let go of the scrubbing brush. Not until I see the blood speckling my arm. Gasping, I drop the brush. It clatters on the cold, wet tile beside the dead man&#x2019;s head. An owl cries outside, and a clock chimes nine times.</p><p>My mind wheels back to twelve hours ago, before the world turned on its head<i>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. </i></p><p>�&nbsp;�&nbsp;�</p><p><b>Nine o&#x2019;clock this morning:</b> I strapped on the Lady Tin-Yin&#x2019;s violin case and glared at my father, who was holding a conch shell to his ear. I thought it was pretty when I bought it from the curiosity shop back in New York. But ever since he began listening to it every morning and every evening, just to hear the ocean, I&#x2019;ve wanted to smash it.</p><p>He put the shell down on the cutting table, then unfolded a bolt of calico. Our store, the Whistle, was already open but no one was clamoring for dry goods just yet.</p><p>The floor creaked as I swept by the sacks of coffee stamped with the word <i>Whistle</i> and headed straight for the candy. Father was cutting the fabric in the measured way he did everything. <i>Snip. Snip.</i></p><p>Noisily, I stuffed a tin of peppermints into my case for the children&#x2019;s lessons, then proceeded to the door. Unlike Father, I kept my promises. If a student played his scales correctly, I rewarded him with a peppermint. Never would I snatch the sweet out of his mouth and replace it with, say, cod-liver oil. Never.</p><p>&#x201c;Sammy.&#x201d;</p><p>My feet slowed at my name.</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t forget your shawl.&#x201d; <i>Snip.</i></p><p>I considered leaving without it so I wouldn&#x2019;t ruin my exit. But then people would stare even more than they usually did. I returned to our cramped living quarters in the back of the store and snatched the woolen bundle from a basket. Underneath my shawl, Father had hidden a plate of <i>don tot</i> for me to find, covered by a thin layer of parchment. I lifted off the parchment. Five custard tarts like miniature sunflowers shone up at me. He must have woken extra early to make them because he knew I&#x2019;d still be mad.</p><p>I took the plate and the shawl and returned to the front of the shop. &#x201c;You said we&#x2019;d move back to New York, not two thousand miles the other way.&#x201d; New York had culture. With luck, I might even make a living as a musician there.</p><p>His scissors paused. When he finally looked up at me, I raised my gaze by a fraction. His neatly combed hair had more white than I remembered.</p><p>&#x201c;I said one day,&#x201d; he returned evenly. &#x201c;One day.&#x201d; Then his tone lightened. &#x201c;They say the Pacific Ocean&#x2019;s so calm, you could mistake it for the sky. We&#x2019;d see so many new animals. Dolphins, whales longer than a city block, maybe even a mermaid.&#x201d; His eyes twinkled.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not a child anymore.&#x201d; Only two months from sixteen.</p><p>&#x201c;Just so.&#x201d; He frowned and returned to his cutting. Then he cleared his throat. &#x201c;I have great plans for us. Mr. Trask and I&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>Mr. Trask again. I set the plate down on the cutting table, and one of the fragile custards broke. Father lifted an eyebrow.</p><p>&#x201c;Only men who want to pound rocks go to California,&#x201d; I snapped. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s rocks and nothing.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;California&#x2019;s not the moon.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It is to me.&#x201d; Though I knew I shouldn&#x2019;t claim the last word, I couldn&#x2019;t help it. I was born in the Year of the Snake after all, 1833. Father looked at me with sad but forgiving eyes. My anger slipped a fraction. With a sigh, I carefully scooped the broken tart off the plate and left the shop.</p><p>�&nbsp;�&nbsp;�</p><p><b>Five o&#x2019;clock: </b>Keeping my chin tucked in, I hurried down the road, kicking up dust around my skirts. The smell of smoke was especially robust tonight. Maybe the smokehouse had burned the meats again. The boys who worked there were not particularly gifted, plus they were mean. I already knew they would overcharge us for the salt pork we&#x2019;d need for the trek west, and Father would have no choice but to pay.</p><p>I marched past uneven blocks of mismatched buildings, longing for the orderly streets of New York City. There were actual sidewalks there, and the air always smelled like sea brine and hot bread, unlike St. Joe, which reeked of garbage and smoke and&#x2014;</p><p>I lifted my head. The sky had thickened to a hazy gray, textured with particles<i>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. </i> like ash? Something sour rose in my throat.</p><p>It was not the smokehouse meat that was burning.</p><p>I ran, my violin bouncing against my back.</p><p>Oh please, God, no.</p><p>I flew past empty streets and turned onto Main, where suddenly there were too many people, some standing like cattle, others clutching squirming children to them. Noise assaulted me from all sides, people yelling, animals braying, and my own ragged breath.</p><p>The Whistle was a charred heap, an ugly inkblot against the dusky sky. The heat made the air look wavy, but the bitter reek in my nose told me the scene was no mirage. Ashes fluttered like black snowflakes all around.</p><p>&#x201c;Father!&#x201d; I pounded toward the remains, scanning the area for his distinctive figure. His dark hair and small build. The worn jacket with the patches on the elbows that he wouldn&#x2019;t replace because he was saving for my future. Maybe he had shed it, for surely he was hauling water along with the rest of the men.</p><p>Smoke filled my lungs, and burned my eyes as I rubbed my grimy fingers into them.</p><p>&#x201c;Out of the way!&#x201d; yelled a man carrying buckets. Water sloshed onto my skirt.</p><p>I trotted beside him as he carried the buckets to another man who threw them onto the smoldering ruins. &#x201c;My father&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>The man barely glanced at me. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s gone.&#x201d;</p><p>I uttered a hoarse cry. <i>Gone?</i></p><p>&#x201c;Lucky you weren&#x2019;t there yourself or you&#x2019;d have been trapped, too. Now move!&#x201d; He trod on my foot as he shoved by, but I hardly felt it.</p><p>My God, I didn&#x2019;t&#x2014;I should have<i>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. </i></p><p>&#x201c;How?&#x201d; I asked no one in particular. Was it an accident? Father was the most careful person I knew. He always doused the stove after we used it, and strictly enforced our NO SMOKING PERMITTED signage. No, if it was an accident, it couldn&#x2019;t have been Father&#x2019;s.</p><p>Whoever was responsible, may he pay for it in a thousand ways, go blind in both eyes, deaf in both ears. Better yet, may he perish in hell.</p><p>I choked back a sob and tried to make sense of the fuming mess in front of me. There was nothing but jagged piles of charred fragments. I could make out a heap of ash in the spot where we kept our wooden safe. Though Mother&#x2019;s bracelet was no longer inside, it had held other irreplaceable treasures. A photo of Mother. Father&#x2019;s immigration papers.</p><p>A wall of heat stopped me from going closer than fifteen feet from our front door, or where it used to be. My eyes burned as I strained to find my father, still not quite believing the horror was real. But as the heat began to cook my skin, I knew as sure as the Kingdom hadn&#x2019;t come that he was gone. My father burned alive.</p><p>I shuddered and then my chest began to rack so hard I could scarcely draw a breath. Smoke engulfed me, thick and unyielding, but the awful truth rooted me to the spot: after I&#x2019;d given my last lesson of the day, I&#x2019;d dawdled along the banks of the dirty Missouri, throwing stones instead of coming home directly. I should have been with him.</p><p><i>Oh, Father, I&#x2019;m sorry I argued with you. I&#x2019;m sorry I left with my nose in the air. Were you remembering that when the smoke robbed you of your last breath? You always said,</i> Have patience in one moment of anger, and you will avoid one hundred days of sorrow. <i>My temper has cost me a lifetime of sorrow. And now, I will never be able to ask your forgiveness, or see your kind face again.</i></p><p>Another man carrying buckets barreled toward me. &#x201c;Move back, girl, you&#x2019;re in the way!&#x201d;</p><p>I stumbled toward an elm tree, and there I stood, even after the glowing hot spots had ceased to burn, and buckets were no longer emptied.</p><p>Still the black snow fell, bits of my life flaking down on me.</p><p></p><p></p><p>2</p><p>&#x201c;SHE&#x2019;S BEEN STANDING THERE OVER AN HOUR,&#x201d; a man muttered to another as they passed by.</p><p>&#x201c;Place just lit up,&#x201d; said a woman from behind. &#x201c;Everything burned, even the Chinaman.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They sold the Whistle to a Chinaman?&#x201d; asked another woman.</p><p>My face flushed at her commenting on this rather than on Father&#x2019;s death. We were never welcome here. Why should I expect people to care now, just because Father had died? I turned to glare at the two women, only now noticing the crowd that had gathered. The thick soup of smoke had thinned to a veil of black.</p><p>&#x201c;Six months ago. Where you been? Well, that&#x2019;s the chance you take when you operate a dry goods. Places like that are tinderboxes.&#x201d; This first woman finally noticed me, my lips clamped tight and my eyes swollen. She elbowed her friend, then they hurried away.</p><p>Fly, you crows. My father was not a spectacle. He was the greatest man I ever knew. He was my everything.</p><p>I clutched at the elm tree before I fell over.</p><p>A child born in the Year of the Snake was lucky. But every so often, a Snake was born unlucky. Mother died in childbirth, a clear indication that my life would be unlucky. To counteract my misfortune, a blind fortune-teller told Father never to cut my hair, or bad luck would return. In addition, she said I should resist my Snake weaknesses, such as crying easily and needing to have the last word.</p><p>&#x201c;&#x2019;Tis a shame about your daddy,&#x201d; said a familiar voice. Our landlord, Ty Yorkshire, shook his head. His puffed skin made him look older than my father, though they were both in their forties.</p><p>I wiped my eyes with the back of my hand.</p><p>&#x201c;My best building, too,&#x201d; he said in his rapid speech that caused his jowls to shake. His left eye winked, the lashes fluttering like moth wings. &#x201c;Sometimes you roll snake eyes.&#x201d;</p><p>I gasped. He knew my Chinese lunar sign? It took me a moment to realize he was talking about gambling, not me.</p><p>&#x201c;I gotta meet with some company men. You need a place to stay, wash that black off you. La Belle Hotel is one of mine. Betsy will get you a nice room.&#x201d; He tipped the edge of his hat, then hailed two men.</p><p>I blinked at his departing back. Despite his kind offer, the man always made me uneasy. Maybe it was the way his black suits hung over his too-wide hips, reminding me of a spade. Father said spades represented greed, because the first Chinese coins bore that shape.</p><p>One of the onlookers covered her mouth and recoiled when she saw me. A man put a protective arm around her shoulders, like I was a wounded animal that might bite. I couldn&#x2019;t blame him. I was unsure of my own reactions. The anger and horror poisoning my insides made every nerve sing in pain, made me want to scream, and weep. I was my violin bow, bent to the breaking point and on the verge of snapping in two.</p><p>But I did not snap. Instead, I shuffled toward Main, not even sure where I was going as I picked my way around horse pies.</p><p>Did he suffocate before the flames&#x2014;?</p><p>I shook my head. I couldn&#x2019;t bear to think of it.</p><p>My adopted French grandfather called Father his scholar. Father could predict the weather by listening to birdsong. Knew which plants healed and which poisoned. Spoke six languages. Tipped his hat to everyone, even Mrs. Whitecomb, who regularly pinched buttons from us.</p><p>The moist evening air licked at my face and bare arms. Somewhere I had lost my shawl.</p><p>To my right, a line of wagons led down to the Missouri River. The town of St. Joe squatted at the edge of the civilized world. Folks came here to jump into the great unknown, starting with a ferry ride across the dirty Missouri.</p><p>Into the great unknown was where the grocer Mr. Trask took Mother&#x2019;s jade bracelet after Father inexplicably gave it to him. Now, nothing remained.</p><p>I pressed my violin case into my gut and stared at the river. The shimmering surface beckoned to me. I could be with Father, instead of in this unjust world, which never threw us more than a cold glance. With the strong undertow, death would be quick.</p><p>But Father would not want that.</p><p>Dazed, I stumbled away. My boot caught on a sandbag and this time I did fall, sending my case skittering in front of me.</p><p>&#x201c;Look sharp!&#x201d; yelled a young man from atop a horse. I covered my head with my arms. His sorrel stamped its print just inches from my head. White markings extended past its fetlocks like socks. The rider slowed.</p><p>&#x201c;You okay, miss?&#x201d; he asked in a soft but clear voice.</p><p>I nodded but didn&#x2019;t look back. Father always said, <i>He who gets up more than he falls, succeeds.</i> I scrambled to collect my violin before another horse came along and trampled it. The rider moved on.</p><p>I found myself staring up at La Belle Hotel, whose pink walls set it apart from its drab neighbors. Up close, I noticed the dirt overlaying the paint. Father and I avoided this street because he said the uneven surface brought bad energy. But I had nowhere else to go.</p><p>I swung open the heavy door. Behind an elaborately carved walnut counter, a woman in bright taffeta lifted her shriveled face to me. &#x201c;Yes?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Good evening, ma&#x2019;am,&#x201d; I said in a shaky voice. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m Samantha Young. Mr. Yorkshire said I might find accommodation here.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Good Lord,&#x201d; she muttered, thin nose twitching like a mouse&#x2019;s.</p><p>Her cane dragged along the floor as she hobbled toward me, <i>shhh, tap, shhh, tap.</i> She raked a contemptuous eye across my face and down to my worn boots. After an eternal pause, she said, &#x201c;Annamae, bring Miss Young up to room 2A and scrub her down.&#x201d;</p><p>A girl my age appeared in the doorway behind the staircase, skin the shade of pecans. She didn&#x2019;t wear chains, but the brand on her forearm gave her away: a square with six dots, raised like icing piped onto her skin. If it was possible to feel any sicker, I did. Negroes walked tall and free in New York. I wished for the hundredth time we&#x2019;d never left.</p><p>&#x201c;Miss Betsy, ma&#x2019;am?&#x201d; said Annamae in a quiet voice.</p><p>The old woman squinted, as if the sight of Annamae talking displeased her.</p><p>&#x201c;Thought you wanted me to pick up the linens from the launderer tonight, like I always do. I was just on my way.&#x201d; Annamae pulled her shawl tightly around her shoulders and slanted her heart-shaped face toward the main door.</p><p>&#x201c;Well, I&#x2019;ve changed my mind, and how dare you question me.&#x201d; Miss Betsy&#x2019;s voice sliced through the air. &#x201c;Now do as I ask, and don&#x2019;t be slow about it.&#x201d; She threw a hand at the girl as if to strike her, but Annamae was just out of reach.</p><p>Annamae regarded me with her deeply inset eyes. Chinese people believe that eyes like those indicate an analytical, practical mind. The look she gave me was not unkind, but there was a spark of something there&#x2014;anger?&#x2014;that compounded the guilt I was already feeling. With a last glance at the door, Annamae bowed her head and placed her hand on the banister. One by one, she ascended the stairs, as if...</p></p><h2>Real, Vol. 1</h2><p>� From the creator of Slam Dunk and Vagabond, also available from VIZ Media.<br>� 8 million copies of Real have sold in Japan.<br>� Vagabond has sold over 22 million copies worldwide! <br>� Inoue received the 2000 Media Arts award for manga from the Japanese Ministry of Culture and the Kodansha award for best manga for his work on Vagabond.<br>� Nominated for 2003 Eisner Award in the category for Best Writer/Artist!<br>� Inoue&#x2019;s previous series Slam Dunk has over 100 million copies in print worldwide.<br>� Everything Takehiko Inoue has published has hit the top ten sales list in Japan.<br><br>A motorcycle accident, bone cancer, a speeding truck crashing into a boy on a stolen bicycle--tragic, life-changing events turn the worlds of three young men upside down.

His first major success -- the hugely popular 31-volume long basketball manga SLAM DUNK -- sold over 100 million copies worldwide and catapulted him into the top ranks of Japanese manga artists. Besides manga, Inoue also worked on character design for the Playstation basketball game ONE ON ONE.Basketball-obsessed manga superstar Inoue (<i>Vagabond</i>; <i>Slam Dunk</i>) returns with a series about wheelchair basketball. Nomiya is a young thug recently kicked out of high school who yearns to play basketball. When he meets the wheelchair-bound basketball prodigy Kiyoharu Tagawa, the two begin hustling pickup games at local outdoor courts. In the meantime, Takahashi, the newly appointed captain of Nomiya's former school basketball team, is hit by a car and paralyzed from the waist down. This first volume feels less dynamic than Inoue's previous manga series, and it would have been a better idea for Viz to follow Del Rey's example and simultaneously release volumes one and two for readers to get a better foundation for the story. Inoue's illustrations are consistently gorgeous&#x2014;volume one features ink watercolor paintings of his characters. His sense of action and drama is solid, but this opening book feels as though Inoue is figuring out how to get the different parts of his story to fit together fluidly&#x2014;something to be remedied by volume two. Those who enjoyed Inoue's other famed basketball manga, <i>Slam Dunk</i>, and anyone moved by triumph over great obstacles are encouraged to give it a read. <i>(July)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

For young queen Raisa <i>ana'</i>Marianna, maintaining peace even within her own castle walls is nearly impossible; tension between wizards and Clan has reached a fevered pitch.

Before long, Han finds himself in possession of a secret believed to be lost to history, a discovery powerful enough to unite the people of the Fells.

The thousand-year hatred between Wizards and Clans is boiling over; Raisa cannot trust her mercenary army or its leaders; neighboring countries are poised to invade; and each faction demands Raisa's arranged marriage or murder (preferably both). She cannot even trust her bodyguard and lover, Han Alister, the former streetlord turned wizard, because he constantly keeps secrets from her. Is he behind the recent wizard murders and the burning of the city? Meanwhile, Han does his best to keep Raisa and her kingdom in one piece, but powerful enemies attack him from every side, physically and politically. In the midst of everything, he discovers that the land's thousand-year-old feud is based on betrayal and lies. Is there any hope for the queendom, or Han and Raisa's love? Chima has built a complex world filled with equally complex characters, living out an expertly structured and balanced plot in which everything that can go wrong does. Lovers of the series will dive in headlong to learn the fate of the people and lands they love, eating up the devious political machinations, the wizard magic, and bloody battles and will tear through the pages to see if true love wins. Newcomers, though, will be hopelessly lost, so only purchase where the series is popular. This fourth book in the Seven Realms series is recommended for lovers of political and action-laden fantasy, though scenes of violence and torture make it more appropriate for high school.-Melissa Moore. Set in an incredibly written fantasy world full of political turmoil, The Crimson Crown's gripping action scenes, coupled with forbidden romance, will immediately pull readers into Han and Raisa's captivating story. This stunning conclusion to the Seven Realms series takes readers on a fantastic ride through a country on the brink of both civil and international war, but whose people possess the most important emotion of all-hope. 5Q, 5P.-Camille Birch, Teen Reviewer. VOYA"<br><br>In this concluding volume of the series, wizard, thief, and now bodyguard Han Allister longs to marry his charge Queen Raisa, but she's committed to a political marriage to save her quarreling queendom. The "jinxflingers" hate the native Demonai clans, someone is murdering wizards in the slums (and Han is the prime suspect), and the Ardenine army hovers on the border, waiting for an excuse to invade. Only by playing the multiple schemers off one another to heal the country can Han hope to win Raisa's hand. Here the promise of previous volumes is realized: the budding love story springs to full flower and the hints captured in thousand-year-old legends are borne out, while the stakes are ratcheted up to perilous heights. Betrayal, war, and the faith of lovers all come around to a glorious conclusion as Chima weaves together her geopolitical, magical, romantic, and even mythical themes on an epic scale. anita l. burkam Horn Book"<br><br>Torture and treasure, treason and trust, and the triumph of true love: All come to fruition in the stirring conclusion to this epic fantasy series. Raisa ana'Marianna has claimed the Gray Wolf throne, but her grip is tenuous: Every faction-clans, wizards, army, flatlanders-both within and without the Fells hates all the others, and each pushes Raisa to accept its preferred candidate for consort. Meanwhile, Han Alister has taken his seat on the Wizard Council at the queen's command, but every other member secretly wants to use him or kill him. Furthermore, there are the mysterious murders of wizards, marked with Han's old streetlord sign; all this disarray signals a weakness that encourages invading armies from the South. Together, Han and Raisa seek the long-lost Armory of the Gifted Kings as the only way to avoid re-enacting a 1,000-year-old tragedy; but to wield such a weapon may well trigger an even greater catastrophe. Chima manages to resolve this impossibly tangled skein of politics, intrigue, history, prejudice and passion with style and grace. Grim scenes of shocking violence alternate with moments of tenderness and humor, and the high body count is balanced by the almost fairy-tale romantic conclusion.

Cutout circles at the eyes reveal colors on succeeding pages. The slight text, occasionally in rhyme, introduces adjectives through the count, and tries to set a context of wish-fulfillment. It's a slick production, attempting several concepts at once--numbers, shapes, colors, imagining, addition to a value of one--but it doesn't quite hang together, and its result is a little breathless. MacDonald and Oakes' Numblers (Dial, 1988) also uses strong color and stark form to present visually the concepts of increasing quantity and transformations, but in a more thoughtful and well-integrated way, with movement inherent in the design. Another little dark fish, Lionni's Swimmy (Pantheon, 1963), has a more meaningful underwater exploration, incorporating the idea of changing appearances into the story. --Karen Litton, London Public Libraries, Ontario, Canada<br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Preacher Book Two</h2><p><p><b>In the continuing saga of the bizarre adventures of faithless Texas preacher Jesse Custer, along with his girlfriend Tulip, and their friend Cassidy, the Irish vampire, head west to a party of Babylonian proportions.

Also, some 70 years of backstory for Custer&#x2019;s sidekick, hard-drinking Irish vampire Cassidy, are filled in.

For many years while running La Brea Bakery and the pastry kitchen at Campanile, my first restaurant, which I opened in 1989 with my then husband, I didn&#x2019;t cook at all&#x2014;other than foods, such as pasta with butter, for my kids&#x2019; dinner. But that changed about fifteen years ago, when I started spending time in Italy. From the very first summer that I rented an apartment in a small medieval hill town on the Umbria-Tuscany border where I now own a home, my being situated in Umbria and the bounty of the area turned out to be the perfect storm that blew me back into the kitchen. <br><br> With local ingredients including cherry tomatoes, red torpedo onions, and fragrant basil at the height of their season; regional specialties such as chickpeas, lentils, and sheep&#x2019;s milk cheese; long summer days when it stays light until almost ten o&#x2019;clock; and an endless cast of hungry friends who arrived weekly from Los Angeles and rented apartments and houses in the same town, I started cooking again&#x2014;more than I ever had. And despite the fact that I had rented a house with a tiny kitchen stocked with aluminum pots and pans and one dull knife, I was reminded of how much I love preparing food for family and friends&#x2014;old and new. <br><br> My friend Suzanne Tracht, also a chef and restaurant owner, of the Los Angeles chophouse Jar, had rented an apartment right on the piazza, in the center of town. During the day, Suzanne and I and other friends would explore the surrounding areas, discovering cheese makers, farm stands, outdoor markets that popped up in different towns on different days, and little artisan shops that sold pastas, oils, vinegars, and other condiments. We were like kids in candy stores. We bought everything that delighted us, brought it home to our inadequate kitchens, and we cooked. And cooked and cooked. <br><br> While we were preparing the food, the guys and the kids would set up a long table outside, essentially in the piazza (in fact, an indoor/outdoor restaurant now exists in the very space where we once put our table). Suzanne and I would put out platters of food as they were done, preparations that showcased all the wonderful ingredients we found locally: balsamic-glazed onions with fresh bay leaves, slow-roasted tomatoes on the vine, radicchio salad, hand-sliced local prosciutto, and grilled bread&#x2014;simple, rustic foods that could be prepared ahead of time, so we could sit down and enjoy the meal with everyone else. Soon, we discovered we loved our own private &#x201c;restaurant&#x201d; as much as going out, and we began to entertain in this way night after night and, after I bought a home in the town, year after year. <br><br> Meanwhile, back in Los Angeles, I had a patio built, including an outdoor fireplace to cook in and a wisteria-covered pergola under which I put a long dining table. And I began to entertain not just in Italy in the summertime, but on a year-round basis. Over the last fifteen years, I have found myself saying countless times, &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s have it at my house.&#x201d; I&#x2019;ve hosted regular weeknight get-togethers with close friends, baby showers for Mozza staff members, birthday parties, charity events, and even a couple of weddings. <br><br> This book is a collection of recipes that reflects the style I developed in cooking those meals. There are no intricately plated dishes here and nothing that needs to be served piping hot. Antipasti, whether Marinated Olives with Fresh Pecorino, Pickled Vegetables, or Pimento Cheese with Celery Sticks, can be put out while you&#x2019;re assembling the rest of the meal. Salads, built of sturdy lettuces such as radicchio and other chicories, Little Gem, and hearts of romaine that don&#x2019;t wilt quickly, are piled high in large, wide-mouthed bowls. The simple preparations of side dishes such as Slow-Roasted Roma Tomatoes with Garlic and Thyme, Corn on the Cob with Chile Butter, Roasted Carrots with Chick- peas and Cumin, and Roasted Asparagus with Herb Vinaigrette take advantage of the natural flavor of seasonal vegetables. And main dishes are kept simple, either marinated and grilled, as is the case with Grilled Lamb Shoulder Chops with Mint Yogurt Sauce and Sicilian Swordfish Spiedini, or as with Dave&#x2019;s Oven-Roasted Grouper with Spicy Tomato Marmalade and Tahini, and are cooked in the oven and served in the pans in which they were cooked. <br><br> I&#x2019;m not saying these are thirty-minute meals, because they&#x2019;re not. Home cooking is often slow cooking. There is no shortcut to braising an oxtail, but it can be done in advance, and the oven does all the work for you while you&#x2019;re making side dishes or taking a shower. Eggplant Lasagne, made with store-bought noodles, can be assembled hours ahead and put in the oven just in time for dinner. And all of the desserts can be made many hours prior to serving time. Or maybe not at all. When I don&#x2019;t have time to prepare dessert, I pass ice cream bars around after dinner, or toss a selection of artisan candy bars into the center of the table. Friends break them up and share. It&#x2019;s like breaking bread&#x2014;only sweeter. That, for me, is what entertaining is all about. <br><br>The book is organized by meals; for each, I give one main dish and a selection of antipasti, side dishes, and salads to choose from to go with the main dish. Additionally, I give suggestions under the heading &#x201c;Other Menu Options&#x201d; for recipes that appear elsewhere in the book but would complement the meal. My idea in building the book this way isn&#x2019;t that you make everything listed (which would be impossible or at least insane in some instances), but that you use the items listed as a guideline for what to serve with this main dish. These are flavors and textures that go well together and that wouldn&#x2019;t offend me if I saw them all on one plate. I&#x2019;m not a fan of potlucks for that very reason: people bring all kinds of things that don&#x2019;t necessarily go with one another but that end up touching each other on guests&#x2019; plates. I do understand the appeal of the potluck in terms of easing the load for the host or hostess. If you have a friend or family member who enjoys cooking or baking and really wants to contribute, have them choose from the recipes listed under the main dish you&#x2019;re making. <br><br> Desserts are in their own chapter. For each dessert I suggest what main dishes I would serve it with, and there are a few cases in which I am specific about which dessert I recommend, such as Mexican Wedding Cookies with Sal&#x2019;s Roasted Pork Shoulder. But with few exceptions, you could serve any dessert with any meal in the book. <br><br> Because I really just love feeding crowds of people, working on the recipes in this book challenged me to think about how to optimize the guests&#x2019; experience. When I started out, my one requirement was that every dish should hold up on a buffet, which meant it had to taste good at room temperature, wouldn&#x2019;t wilt after an hour, and also wouldn&#x2019;t look terrible as guests started digging in. But as I got into the process of producing the book, all the while hosting dinners and parties offering the foods that I was including here, I went a step further: I began to think of creative ways that I could make the buffet table work to my advantage. I started putting a block of cheese and a grater alongside salads that called for grated cheese, such as the Whole Leaf Caesar Salad with Fried Parsley Leaves and Anchovy Croutons, so that guests could grate a fresh dusting of cheese on their own servings. Having the cheese and grater also makes it easy for me to freshen up the serving bowl with a snowdrift of cheese when I walk by. I knew I couldn&#x2019;t put an arugula salad on my buffet table, because arugula wilts if you look at it sideways. But when I found myself wanting arugula alongside Prosciutto Mozzarella Parcels, I found a way to do it: I put out a bowl of arugula, along with bottles of olive oil and balsamic vinegar, and bowls of lemon and sea salt for guests to make their own arugula salads on their plates. In many instances, such as with Flattened Chicken Thighs with Charred Lemon Salsa Verde or Blistered Green Beans with Yogurt Dressing, I spoon or drizzle just enough sauce on the dish so guests understand where it goes, and serve the rest on the side. The desserts are left unsliced, presented with a knife so guests can cut the size serving they want. And the frostings for Spiced Carrot Cake with Molasses Cream Cheese Frosting and Devil&#x2019;s Food Rings with Spiced White Mountain Frosting are served on the side. I think personalizing your food adds to your guests&#x2019; experience, and that&#x2019;s what I am after when I entertain. I want to offer my friends and family not just great food, but a great experience. Because I can&#x2019;t have all of you to my house, I hope you&#x2019;ll enjoy the experience of cooking from this book&#x2014;and, of course, I hope you&#x2019;ll enjoy the food. <br><br> <b>How to Pull It Off <br></b><br> I recently wrote a story for the Los Angeles Times revealing my biggest secret when it comes to entertaining: enlisting the help of your guests. When I have a party&#x2014;whether it&#x2019;s a huge fund-raising event or a dozen friends on a weeknight&#x2014;I can say without a doubt: I never do it alone. For one, I couldn&#x2019;t do it alone. The kind of food I cook involves some effort. There are vinaigrettes to whisk, vegetables to roast, salads to toss. Even the simplest appetizer, guacamole and chips, needs somebody to put those two things in bowls and carry them to the table. And that&#x2019;s just the food. Wine bottles need to be opened, bags of ice dumped into the beverage tub, the grill needs to be lit, the table needs to be set. Then there are the candles, the music, the sweeping of the patio . . . If I had to do it all myself, I probably wouldn&#x2019;t find myself saying, &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s have it at my house,&#x201d; as often as I do. But the other, more important reason to enlist help is that it&#x2019;s so much more fun to prepare a meal with friends. <br><br> In my mother&#x2019;s day, the hostess would never have asked her friends to pitch in. My mother, for instance, despite the fact that she worked as a television writer while raising two children, would have wanted to take care of every last detail. When guests arrived, it wasn&#x2019;t, &#x201c;Here, put this on the table,&#x201d; as I am known to do. My mother (and probably every other woman of her generation) wanted her guests to be impressed, to wonder how she did it. And these were her friends!<br><br> Thankfully, times have changed. There is no illusion or fa�ade, at least not in my world. My friends all know how much effort it takes to host a meal, large or small, and when we&#x2019;re not hosting, we want to help the one who is. <br><br> I do want to emphasize that I&#x2019;m a nice &#x201c;boss.&#x201d; When my volunteer help comes, I always offer them a glass of wine, and our own little party starts while we pile side dishes onto platters and look for just the right serving utensils to go with them. <br><br> <b>Cooking from This Book <br></b><br> Each of these chapters is built around a main dish, with a list of side dishes and condiments to serve with it. In some chapters, the list includes more options than you may want to make. In addition to the items listed in the menus is a list of &#x201c;Other Menu Options.&#x201d; These are dishes that exist elsewhere in the book but that go well with the main dish in the chapter. Pick from these lists to create a menu that works for you, based on what you feel like cooking and what is in season. <br><br> All of the recipes in this book make enough for six or more. I figure if you are cooking for others, the least number you could be is four. You&#x2019;re probably six, and if you&#x2019;re anything like me, the minute you decide to have people over, you start thinking of who you want to invite, and you&#x2019;re up to ten. The truth is that because these aren&#x2019;t plated dinners, guests take what they want. So the serving size of any one dish depends on how many total dishes you&#x2019;re serving. When I plan a menu, I always err on the side of more because I like to offer a variety. I also tend to get carried away creatively. Thankfully, I&#x2019;m a big fan of leftovers. <br><br> <b>A Note on Olive Oil <br></b><br> You&#x2019;ll notice I make three distinctions when I call for olive oil in the recipes in this book: olive oil, extra-virgin olive oil, and finishing-quality extra-virgin olive oil. Although this might seem like a lot of bottles of olive oil to buy or have on your counter, it might actually save you money because you won&#x2019;t be using your good olive oil where it doesn&#x2019;t make a difference. When I call for &#x201c;olive oil,&#x201d; I&#x2019;m referring to any decent olive oil. I use this when the oil isn&#x2019;t a component to a dish or a condiment&#x2014;for instance, to sear or roast vegetables or meats. This olive oil doesn&#x2019;t even need to be extra virgin. It just needs to not be rancid; over time, you&#x2019;ll learn to recognize rancid oil by the smell. If you cook much at all, this oil won&#x2019;t go rancid because you&#x2019;ll use it more than any other oil. I call for &#x201c;extra-virgin olive oil&#x201d; when the oil is part of the finished product, such as a vinaigrette or salsa verde. For this, I use a slightly higher quality oil; I prefer those produced in Italy, Spain, or France. &#x201c;Finishing-quality extra-virgin olive oil&#x201d; is my way of referring to the special, costlier bottles of olive oil that you see in specialty food stores. I reach for one of these when I am using the oil as a condiment, whether to drizzle over a vegetable dish or grilled meats, or as an unexpected complement for the Bittersweet Chocolate Tartufo with Olive Oil Croutons and Sea Salt. <br><br> <b>A Note on Anchovies <br></b><br> Alici di Cetara are a very special variety of anchovies from a seaside village called Cetara on Italy&#x2019;s Amalfi Coast; they have all the deliciousness of the fish with none of the hard-to-take, overly fishy qualities often associated with anchovies. Cetara anchovies are harvested from April to September and placed in large plastic drums, layered in salt, where they remain for twelve months. After that time, the anchovies are cleaned, dried, filleted by hand, and laid out on linen cloths to dry, a process that supposedly absorbs some of their briny flavor. The fish are packed standing up in either sunflower oil, olive oil, or a combination. I generally like salt-packed anchovies better than those packed in oil, but these are the exception. I use them anytime I am serving anchovies in their whole form (other than marinated white anchovies, which are a dif- ferent thing altogether). You can find them at online outlets that specialize in Italian food exports. <br><br> <b>What Kind of Yogurt to Use <br></b><br> I call for yogurt in several recipes in this book. In Los Angeles, we&#x2019;re lucky to have a specialty Greek grocery named Papa Cristo&#x2019;s, where we get fresh yogurt made that day. In these recipes, I specify the yogurt that I found was the closest in consistency to Papa Cristo&#x2019;s and also widely available, Straus Family Creamery Organic Greek Yogurt, which is thinner than other commercial Greek-style yogurts. If you can&#x2019;t find Straus (or a place like Papa Cristo&#x2019;s where you can buy homemade Greek yogurt), use regular whole-milk plain yogurt. <br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> <b>Washing Greens <br></b><br> You may notice t...</p><h2>Sophie Quire and the Last Storyguard: A Peter Nimble Adventure (A Peter Nimble Adventure, 2)</h2><p>It&#x2019;s been two years since Peter Nimble and Sir Tode rescued the kingdom of HazelPort. In that time, they have traveled far and wide in search of adventure. Now Peter and Sir Tode have been summoned by Professor Cake for a new mission: to find a 12-year-old bookmender named Sophie Quire. Sophie knows little beyond the four walls of her father&#x2019;s bookshop, where she repairs old books and dreams of escaping the confines of her dull life. But when a strange boy and his talking cat/horse companion show up with a rare and mysterious book, she finds herself pulled into an adventure beyond anything she has ever read.<br></p><p><b>Jonathan Auxier</b> is the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>The Night Gardener</i> and <i>Peter Nimble and His Fantastic Eyes</i>, which the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> called &#x201c;as delightful a magical story as readers . . . will hope to find.&#x201d; He teaches children&#x2019;s literature and lives in Pittsburgh with his family. Visit him at www.thescop.com.<br>Gr 4&#x2013;7&#x2014;In the grand tradition of Cornelia Funke's Inkheart and John Stephens's The Emerald Atlas comes this companion novel to Auxier's Peter Nimble and His Fantastic Eyes. Twelve-year-old Sophie Quire mends books in her father's shop and worries about Pyre Day, when Inquisitor Prigg will burn all the storybooks and purge all the "nonsense" from Bustleburgh. Enter dauntless Peter Nimble, the blindfolded thief, and his enchanted companion Sir Tode with the Book of Who for Sophie to mend. The Book is one of four magical tomes (Who, What, Where, When); if all four books are collected, they will unlock a riddle and save the world. Sophie, Peter, and Sir Tode follow the book's clues, dogged by Inquisitor Prigg, his bloodthirsty henchman Torvald Knucklemeat, and Madame Eldritch the potion maker, a tricky woman with her own motives. The final battle to retrieve the books assembles most of the cast in Bustleburgh, where the story began. It's impossible to feel lukewarm about Auxier's work. This author so clearly views books as the elixir of life, and this conviction oozes out of the text. This fast-paced, character-gallery book remains anchored by Sophie's passion for reading and family. Various magical settings like a menagerie surrounded by deadly quickbramble serve as proper backdrop for capacious bestiaries that can describe any person or thing in existence. The final unraveling of the dangers Sophie faces is so intense readers may need to take a breath as they turn the pages.

He can learn to speak new languages fluently, from scratch, in a week. In 2004, he memorized and recited more than 22,000 digits of pi, setting a record. He has savant syndrome, an extremely rare condition that gives him the most unimaginable mental powers, much like those portrayed by Dustin Hoffman in the film <i>Rain Man</i>.<br> <br> Fascinating and inspiring, <i>Born on a Blue Day</i> explores what it&#x2019;s like to be special and gives us an insight into what makes us all human&#x2014;our minds.</p><p><b>Daniel Tammet</b> is a writer, linguist, and educator. A 2007 poll of 4,000 Britons named him as one of the world's "100 living geniuses." His last book, the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>Born on a Blue Day: Inside the Extraordinary Mind of an Autistic Savant</i>, has been translated into 18 languages. He lives in Avignon, France.Although Daniel Tammet is only 27, as an autistic savant with Asperger's syndrome, he has already lived an unusual life. Strict routines are necessary� the same number of flakes of porridge for breakfast and cups of tea at exactly the same time each day. He can recite pi to 22,514 places from memory, and he learned Icelandic in a week. He experiences synesthesia, which makes him see numbers and letters as shapes and colors and emotions. (He was born on a Wednesday, which is a blue day.) Simon Vance enhances this memoir with a sensitive performance. He affects an almost imperceptible awkwardness of speech to capture the spirit of Tammet as an extraordinary and successful individual.

Set in the early 1950s, in an India newly independent and struggling through a time of crisis, <em>A Suitable Boy</em> takes us into the richly imagined world of four large extended families and spins a compulsively readable tale of their lives and loves. A sweeping panoramic portrait of a complex, multiethnic society in flux, <em>A Suitable Boy</em> remains the story of ordinary people caught up in a web of love and ambition, humor and sadness, prejudice and reconciliation, the most delicate social etiquette and the most appalling violence.</p></p><p><p>Vikram Seth has written acclaimed books in several genres: verse novel, <em>The Golden Gate</em>; travel book, <em>From Heaven Lake</em>; animal fables, <em>Beastly Tales</em>; epic fiction, <em>A Suitable Boy</em>. His most recent novel, <em>An Equal Music</em>, was published in 1999. He lives in England and India.</p>Set in newly independent India, Nehru's early 1950's, this adipose saga counterbalances a book of social manners--the marrying off of a well-to-do educated young woman, Lata Mehra--with a historical account (even at the level of transcribed parliamentary debate) of the subcontinent trying to find its societal bearings vis-...-vis language, religion, and the redistribution of estate-lands taken off the hands of the elite. Set mainly in Brahmpur, the story encompasses four well-off families, with a focus mostly on the younger members--poets, academics, playboys, newlyweds--who stitch a pattern of peccadillo through their elders' expectations. Meanwhile, Seth, whose California novel in verse, The Golden Gate (1986), was clever and energetic in concept but dull and soapy in final effect, falls into the same trap here: lots of stuff obviously--at a marathon 1300-plus pages--but characters made out of clich&#x201a;, with background-India the very stuffed pillow of local color that keeps them standing. The book, too, fairly squeaks with its own pleasure in itself, larded with poetry and a general recommendation of art over politics and money: the characters it spends the most time over are narcissists. Anyone wanting to read how a marriageable daughter can X-ray a whole society ought to let this cream-puff-wrapped-in-a-cinder-block pass and return to Tanizaki's classic Japanese masterpiece, The Makioka Sisters. Fat (the publishing world's delayed reparation for Rushdie's Satanic Verses?) but fatuous.

With practical wisdom and insight, Melody Beattie addresses these questions, encouraging us to reach a higher level of living and loving, and showing us how to be at home with ourselves wherever we are in the world, at whatever stage of life. </p> <p> Through true stories and take-action exercises, including journaling, visualizations, affirmations, meditations, and prayers, Beattie provides the essential tools to help us discover our own sense of home.

Beattie urges us to discover new levels of integrity, to break through barriers that have blocked us for too long. This is a powerful and challenging book about buying back our souls and learning to live a life guided by spirit. </p></p><p><p>Melody Beattie is the <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author of <em>Codependent No More</em>, <em>Beyond Codependency</em>, and <em>The Lessons of Love</em>.</p>MULTIPLE Beattie has written previously about codependency, craving and artistic recovery.

In a quiet and serious studio reading, she states that if we have the courage to know ourselves and experience our feelings-even the uncomfortable ones-we can derail the negative spirals that keep us from finding our way home.

It&#x2019;s travels through frightening places, loaded with themes of self-denial and death. How can children approach this season in a way that is meaningful and not frightening? <i>Make Room</i> presents Lent as a special time for creating a welcoming space for God. Other books offer excellent ideas for going through the Lenten season with children, but <i>Make Room</i> uniquely connects its projects to the story of Jesus. Simple and practical activities such as baking bread, having a neighbor over for dinner, uncluttering your room, and watching less TV become acts of justice and kindness, part of a life of following and imitating Christ, and a way to make room for God in our lives and in the world around us.<br><br> Other books tell the Passion narrative for young readers; this unique book integrates themes of hospitality and self-giving that echo Jesus&#x2019; ministry, Jesus&#x2019; entire life. <i>Make Room</i> invites children to wonder about the story, to encounter Lent with all their senses, and to experience activities in Lent as part of a life of discipleship.</p><p><b>Laura Alary</b>&nbsp;is a writer, storyteller, and religious educator. When she was a little girl she used to make her own books out of manila paper, crayons, and mucilage. These early efforts at writing eventually gave way to academic papers and theses, as she earned degrees in Classics (B.A., Dalhousie), Theology (M.Div., Knox College, University of Toronto) and New Testament (Ph.D., University of St. Michael&#x2019;s College). More recently, Laura has focused on a new type of education&#x2014;raising three creative and curious children. She leads workshops on everything from storytelling to biblical interpretation, teaches the occasional university course, and works with children at a local congregation. She has also returned to her early love of creating her own books, including&nbsp;<i>Is That Story True?</i>&nbsp;and <i>Mira and the Big Story</i>. Laura lives in Toronto, Canada.<br><br><b>Ann Boyajian</b> is the illustrator of many books, including&nbsp;<i>Samantha's Friendship Fun</i>&nbsp;(in the American Girl series),&nbsp;<i>More Spice Than Sugar&nbsp;</i>(Houghton Mifflin), and<i>&nbsp;O Say Can You See?

We recommend placing this book on the bottom shelf of your Lent / Easter shelf unit.&#x201d;&nbsp;<b>&#x2014;The Rev. Cheryl V.

This book explains why Lent helps us remember.&nbsp;Taking us through the events of Holy Week, the author explains how all the Lenten traditions we focus on help us &#x201c;Make Room&#x201d; for more of Jesus.&nbsp;While the book is simple enough for a child, it unpacks the importance of participating in Lent very well.&#x201d;&nbsp;<b>&#x2014;Traci Rhoades</b><br><br> &#x201c;The book reveals what is usually hidden: what we knew as penitential is actually life-giving and faith-building.

It is an invitation for children to wonder about the Lenten story, helping children to experience Lent with all their senses. &nbsp;I think it is a fine book for almost any kind of Christian.&#x201d;&nbsp;<b>&#x2014;Byron Borger, </b>Hearts and Minds Books<br><br><i>&#x201c;Make Room: A Children's Guide to Lent and Easter</i> was a solid addition to the religious education of our young children. Where many Easter books focus on the resurrection of Christ, this book tenderly and thoughtfully explained the Lenten season with child-appropriate examples of reasonable and realistic ways in which children can observe. With sections on reaching out to help others, giving away extra so that others can have simply enough, and ways to sit in quiet prayer and reflection, this book created room for ongoing thought-provoking questions. Best of all, the book is written in a way that allows the child to see ways in which to meaningfully participate in the process and shift attention away from a season of &#x2018;I can't have...&#x2019;&nbsp;to a season of preparation and dedication. Make room on your shelf for this title.&#x201d;&nbsp;<b>&#x2014;Amy Shaw, </b>Educator<br><br> &#x201c;Reading&nbsp;<i>Make Room</i>&nbsp;with my two-year old Plum, I delighted to see how Alary makes room for our own conversation within her text, sprinkling pages with&nbsp;<i>I wonder</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>maybe</i>.&nbsp;I wonder why Jesus went into the desert? I wonder who they thought Jesus was?&nbsp;Ann Boyajian&#x2019;s&nbsp;illustrations are&nbsp;thought-filled and beautiful, making the book feel like a window into an active congregation where the Biblical stories are vividly live.&nbsp;I liked how Alary balances wondering questions with more straightforward teaching. She writes simply and clearly so that small children will be able to understand, but older ones will also be able to find rich material &nbsp;for their own wondering.&nbsp;Intriguingly, Alary makes a point of creating a wide sense of&nbsp;space around both the crucifixion and the resurrection. She does not supply the theological meaning behind either aspect of the story, but rather describes the lived history and experience of Easter and again makes room&nbsp;for us all, whatever our theological understanding, within the story.&#x201d;&nbsp;<b>&#x2014;Katie Munnik, </b><i>The Messy Table,&nbsp;</i>Presbyterian Record<br><br> &#x201c;Children of all ages will come away with a broader understanding of the holy Lenten season and what it means to prepare for the glorious gift of Easter and new life in Christ.&#x201d;&nbsp;<b>&#x2014;Michelle Thomas-Bush, </b>Big Ideas in Youth Ministry&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;</p></p><h2>Oskar and the Eight Blessings</h2><p><p><b>Winner of the 2015 National Jewish Book Award for Children's Literature</b></p><p>A refugee seeking sanctuary from the horrors of Kristallnacht, Oskar arrives by ship in New York City with only a photograph and an address for an aunt he has never met.

As Oskar walks the length of Manhattan, from the Battery to his aunt's home in the north end of the city, he passes and encounters the city's many holiday sights and residents. Each person he meets offers Oskar a small act of kindness, such as the newsstand man who gives Oskar a Superman comic book. Each encounter is a reference to an event which took place in the city in 1938. A constant for Oskar is remembering his father's last words, "Oskar, even in bad times, people can be good.

She is the beloved author of many popular books, and lives in Montauk, New York.<br>A graduate of New York City's prestigious Cooper Union Art School, accomplished artist and calligrapher Don Bolognese went on to teach art there and at New York University, Pratt Institute, as well as at the Metropolitan Museum of Art's medieval museum, the Cloisters. He has illustrated more than 90 books for children, many of which he wrote himself; on many others, he has collaborated with his wife, the author and illustrator Elaine Raphael.<br><br>One way in which Bolognese has been able to connect teaching and illustration is through his many &#x201c;how-to&#x201d; books for children, which range from relatively simple exercises in drawing skills to more complex lessons in art techniques. Bolognese himself has illustrated a wide variety of fiction and nonfiction works, and his attention to detail and vivid presentation have earned him critical acclaim and numerous awards. A native of New York City, Bolognese now lives in New York and Vermont. <br>Gr. 2^-3. It's too bad the illustrations aren't livelier, because the story about the first Seeing Eye dog in America is quite upbeat and contains some interesting anecdotes. Moore's telling is a little stiff at first, but the circumstances, relayed in a straightforward manner softened with some conversation, win out: Moore follows the dog from training in Switzerland to home in America with Morris Frank, who was instrumental in starting the Seeing Eye in America in the 1930s. The typeface is slightly enlarged, and there's additional leading to make the reading easier. Not every page has an illustration, but there are plenty of pictures to break up the text. <i>Stephanie Zvirin</i></p><h2>Secret of the Time Tablets (Cleopatra in Space #3)</h2><p>Cleo and her friends journey from Yasiro Academy to the city of Hykosis, where some of the most notorious thieves and assassins live.

Octavian and an entire fleet of Xerx warriors surround the spaceship. Managing to escape, Cleo then devises tricky entry into the barbarous city of Hykosis, where she and Akila meet up with Antony, the sword thief. Forced to rely on one another, they warily join forces to find the time tablets Cleo needs. The tension among the three is readily apparent, although there are humorous and heartwarming moments, too. As with the two previous titles, the images, verbal sound effects, and enterprising plot create a rewarding comic narrative that weaves together the past and the future. Fans of Star Wars and Egyptian mythology will particularly enjoy this intriguing tale. VERDICT An exciting, humorous, and satisfying conclusion to Cleo's fate.

Drawing on inside accounts and case studies and academic research from a wealth of industries-- including start-ups, pharmaceuticals, airlines, retail, financial services, high-tech, education, non-profits, government, and healthcare-- Sutton and Rao identify the key scaling challenges that confront every organization.&nbsp; They tackle the difficult trade-offs that organizations must make between whether to encourage individualized approaches tailored to local needs or to replicate the same practices and customs as an organization or program expands. They reveal how the best leaders and teams develop, spread, and instill the right mindsets in their people-- rather than ruining or watering down the very things that have fueled successful growth in the past. They unpack the principles that help to cascade excellence throughout an organization, as well as show how to eliminate destructive beliefs and behaviors that will hold them back.&nbsp;<br><br><i>Scaling Up Excellence</i> is the first major business book devoted to this universal and vexing challenge and it is destined to become the standard bearer in the field.</p><p><p><b>Author One-on-One: Robert Suttonand Huggy Rao talk about <i>Scaling Up Excellence</i></b></p> <p><strong>Robert Sutton: </strong>Why don&#x2019;t we start off with why we wrote this book?</p> <p><strong>Huggy Rao: </strong>We wanted to give the executives we teach and advise better answers. In 2006, we launched an executive education program at Stanford called Customer-focused Innovation. Executives in the program kept asking us different versions of the same question. Their companies all had a pocket or two where people were customer focused. The problem was that there just wasn&#x2019;t enough of it. They asked how they could spread such excellence and do it fast. We scoured academic research and practical books on leaders and teams. We found a lot on topics such as leadership and innovation. But we couldn&#x2019;t find a single business book devoted to this problem, which we started calling &#x201c;the problem of more&#x201d; or the challenge of &#x201c;scaling up excellence.&#x201d;</p> <p>We spent the next seven years studying and writing about it. I believe that this is the first major business or leadership book on scaling. We worked hard to write an approachable and useful book, but also one that digs into this vexing challenge in some depth. We offer much hard won advice, but no instant and easy cures.</p> <p>Bob, why don&#x2019;t you tell people about our research? It was quite an adventure.</p> <p><strong>RS: </strong>We started by doing interviews and case studies, and digging up the most rigorous studies we could find on scaling. But we also wanted to reach out to people who were in the thick of scaling challenges. So we checked repeatedly with senior leaders such as Kaiser Permanente&#x2019;s Louise Liang (who led a successful information technology rollout in the largest U.S. private healthcare system), Facebook executive&#x2019;s Chris Cox and Mike Schroepfer (who grew the engineering organization), and JetBlue Airlines pilot and executive Bonny Simi (who led a bottom-up effort to create and scale up a better system for dealing with operational challenges caused by bad weather). We wanted to make sure that the challenges we discussed, the stories we told, and advice we offered rang true to these and hundreds of other scaling up veterans we talked to during those seven years.</p> <p><strong>HR: </strong>What do you say when people ask you &#x201c;what do you mean by scaling?&#x201d;</p> <p><strong>RS: </strong>I tell them that we fixed our focus on a simple, but tough, question: If your organization has a bit of excellence, a pocket of goodness, how do you spread it? Early on in the project, I saw an interview with the famous folk singer Pete Seeger. He said something like &#x201c;Sometimes the only thing wrong with it is there isn&#x2019;t enough of it.&#x201d; A lovely way to describe the main problem we tackled. </p> <p><strong>HR: </strong>I was struck by how similar the scaling challenges were that different organizations faced. The challenges of growing Google, of opening 180 highly standardized Bridge International Academy schools for poor children in Africa, and spreading practices for preventing infections to over 3000 hospitals sound quite different on first blush. But they turned out to be remarkably similar in many ways once we looked closely.</p> <p><strong>RS: </strong>How so?</p> <p><strong>HR: </strong>In every case, successful scaling didn&#x2019;t mean just creating as big a footprint as possible, as fast possible &#x2013; it required spreading a shared mindset that guided how people thought and acted. We learned that, especially in cases of fast and effective scaling, the teams that guided these efforts often slowed down at key junctures &#x2013; to think about what they are doing and to develop true excellence &#x2013; so they could move faster later. Scaling takes both patience and persistence, in concert with an obsessive focus on making progress toward long term goals every hour of every day.</p> <p><strong>RS: </strong>We also learned that the key decisions and scaling principles were remarkably similar across different kinds of organizations. For example every organization and project gets more complex as it expands. More processes, layers, locations, and people are required. As a result, scaling nearly always adds &#x201c;cognitive load&#x201d; -- increased demands -- on people and teams. If it is not dealt with well, people feel overwhelmed. It becomes hard to get simple things done. In the best organizations, to paraphrase Twitter&#x2019;s head of engineering Chris Fry, leaders use the hierarchy to destroy bad bureaucracy -- to make things easier rather than harder for people. Fry&#x2019;s advice holds in every scaling case we studied. </p> <p><strong>RS: </strong>Let&#x2019;s end with the question that EVERYONE asks me about you. Is your name really Huggy?</p> <p><strong>HR: </strong>My real name is Hayagreeva, but my family and friends have always called me Huggy. I thought &#x201c;Huggy&#x201d; would be easier for people to pronounce and remember.</p> <p><strong>RS: </strong> It&#x2019;s been quite a collaboration. Huggy was relentlessly optimistic during even the toughest days. Huggy is among the smartest and most imaginative organizational researchers on the planet. The rate at which he generates ideas astounds me. One minute he might be talking about &#x201c;linking hot causes to cool solution,&#x201d; the next &#x201c;scaling is about going from bad to great, not so much good to great.&#x201d; </p> <p>We worked with so many terrific people facing scaling challenges, from entrepreneurs and startups, to senior executives at big corporations, to leaders and teams in nonprofits and large healthcare systems. But we stayed focused on one goal: Writing a book would ring true and be useful to anyone who strives to develop excellence in organizations and spreading it to others.</p><b>Robert I.

While statistics and sociologists jostle for space alongside <i>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</i> and a kilted haggis, everything is set within a robust biblical anthropology and a well-grounded pastoral psychology. The whole is laced with a fine touch of self-deprecating Scottish humor. Dr. Murray is Jeremiah-like in the rigor and love with which he seeks 'to pluck up and break down . . . to build and to plant.' But he is also Jesus-like in the way he employs the deconstructing and reconstructing grace of the gospel. Here is a book full of practical, spiritual wisdom and a must read.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Sinclair B.

Contained in this book is the answer to the epidemic among both pastors and hardworking Christian men who are physically, emotionally, and spiritually collapsing because of the lightning-fast pace our modern culture demands. Murray lays out a thoroughly biblical, immensely practical plan for any Christian man looking to take back his life from the enslavement of his schedule. Murray&#x2019;s beautiful personal testimony of his own need to reset is worth the book alone. This book will be required reading for every pastor I know.&#x201d; <br>&#x2015;<strong>Brian Croft</strong><strong>,</strong> Senior Pastor, Auburndale Baptist Church; Founder, Practical Shepherding; Senior Fellow, Mathena Center for Church Revitalization, The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary</p><p>&#x201c;In <i>Reset</i>, David Murray pries our fingers from the death grip we have on the idol of activity.

Relentlessly honest, refreshingly concise, and eminently practical, this book may literally save your marriage, your ministry, and your health.

The primary focus is universal (Tier 1) support for all students. Practical, step-by-step guidelines are provided for structuring the classroom environment, actively engaging students in instruction, teaching positive expectations, and establishing a continuum of strategies to reinforce positive behavior and respond to inappropriate behavior. Numerous real-world examples and learning exercises are included. In a large-size format with lay-flat binding for easy photocopying, the book includes reproducible tools for classwide PBIS planning and implementation.

The book will also be useful for veteran school teams who are currently implementing schoolwide PBIS and who are looking for systems and evidence-based practices to extend their supports into classrooms. Among the multitude of books on classroom and behavior management, this one stands out. It should become a required course text."--Tim Lewis, PhD, Department of Special Education, University of Missouri<br><br> "This book provides a very logical and friendly translation of PBIS principles and maps them onto teachers' daily instructional and classroom management tasks. The inclusion of information on Tier 2 and Tier 3 strategies is unique and sets the book apart. It can be used as a course text, a school-based reference, or a 'how to' for those wishing to infuse positive and proactive strategies across the school and across the curriculum."--Terrance M. Scott, PhD, Professor and Distinguished University Scholar, Department of Special Education, University of Louisville <br><br> "Simonsen and Myers have provided an innovative resource for teacher professional development. They demystify the science of behavior with realistic examples (and a bit of humor!) that all educators can relate to and appreciate. The skills-building activities are valuable tools for behavior coaches or consultants working with teachers. This thorough, scientifically sound, practical text is essential reading for educators."--Lucille Eber, EdD, Director, Midwest PBIS Network, Illinois<br><br> "Much needed. This is the first book to bridge the gap between schoolwide PBIS and explicit, comprehensive classwide interventions. Written in lay language, it provides a solid foundation in behavioral principles for effective classroom management. This guide will be beneficial for teachers as well as coaches or facilitators of the PBIS process on a campus and/or within a district. Kudos to Simonsen and Myers for delivering a practical, precise book that will help give all students the opportunity to succeed!"--Heather Peshak George, PhD, Department of Child and Family Studies, University of South Florida<br><br> "This book provides an excellent, comprehensive orientation to classwide PBIS.

Rather than treat grammar as a series of rules to be memorized, it emphasizes the logic behind the English language. In addition, because students often struggle to apply abstract rules or overly simplified examples to the more complex sentences they want to include in their own writing, "How to Write for Class" makes use of material from real papers and walks students through the process of constructing the types of sophisticated statements that will raise their academic writing to the next level. PLEASE NOTE: This book contains some of the same material that appears in "The Ultimate Guide to SAT Grammar" and "The Complete Guide to ACT English." However, it covers concepts in significantly greater depth and and includes different exercises as well as complete chapters not present in the other guides.</p><p></p><h2>Alan Moore&#39;s Writing For Comics Volume 1</h2><p><ul> <li>The master of comic book writing shares his thoughts on how to deliver a top-notch script!

Cal and Bill Ripken understand this like few others. <br><br> From their father, Cal Sr., a legend in the Baltimore Orioles organization for 37 years, they learned to play the game the right way. Those lessons, paired with their combined 33 years of big league experience, helped develop the Ripken Way, a method of teaching the game through simple instruction, solid explanations, encouragement, and a positive atmosphere. In <i>Coaching Youth Baseball the Ripken Way</i>, Cal and Bill share this approach to coaching and development. <br><br> Whether you&#x2019;re teaching your children at home, managing the local travel team, or working with high school-level players, <i>Coaching Youth Baseball the Ripken Way</i> will help you make a difference both on and off the field, with these features:<ul> <li>More than 50 drills covering defense, hitting, pitching, and baserunning </li><li>Age-specific practice plans for players ranging from 4 to 15+ </li><li>Strategies for setting goals and reasonable expectations for your players and team </li><li>Advice on communicating with parents, players, and staff </li><li>Methods for creating a positive and fun environment in which kids can learn the skills and strategies of the game</li></ul> Bill Ripken was once voted by his peers as one of the big league players most likely to become a manager. Cal Ripken, Jr., known as baseball&#x2019;s Iron Man, is a member of the game&#x2019;s All-Century Team and a future Hall of Famer. Together, they are proof positive that the Ripken Way is the right way to teach the game of baseball.</p><p><b>Cal Ripken, Jr.,</b> is baseball&#x2019;s all-time Iron Man. He retired from baseball in October 2001 after 21 seasons with the Baltimore Orioles. His name appears in the record books repeatedly, most notably as one of only eight players in history to record more than 400 home runs and 3,000 hits. In 1995, Ripken broke Lou Gehrig&#x2019;s record for consecutive games played (2,130) and voluntarily ended his streak in 1998 after playing in a world-record 2,632 consecutive games. <br><br> Among his other on-field accolades are American League Rookie of the Year (1982), two-time American League Most Valuable Player (1983, 1991), two-time Gold Glove recipient (1991, 1992), two-time All-Star Game MVP (1991, 2001), and 19 All-Star Game selections. He also was named to Major League Baseball&#x2019;s All-Century Team in 1999. Ripken has made a tremendous impact on the sport and on fans everywhere. In 1999, Babe Ruth League, Inc., changed the name of its largest division (5- to 12-year-olds) from Bambino to Cal Ripken Baseball. Currently, more than 700,000 youths play Cal Ripken Baseball worldwide. He is using the platform that baseball has provided him to construct a baseball complex in his hometown of Aberdeen, Maryland. The one-of-a-kind facility consists of Ripken Stadium, a state-of-the-art 6,000-seat minor league ballpark that is home to the hugely successful Class A Aberdeen IronBirds. Adjacent to the minor league ballpark is the Ripken Youth Baseball Academy, consisting of eight youth fields, including a youth-sized replica of Oriole Park at Camden Yards, a synthetic training infield, a bullpen area, and batting cages. <br><br> Ripken resides in Maryland with his wife, Kelly, and their children, Rachel and Ryan. <br><br> <b>Bill Ripken</b>, a 12-year Major League veteran, began his career with the Baltimore Orioles in 1987 under the direction of his father, Cal Ripken, Sr., and alongside brother Cal Ripken, Jr. This was the first and remains the only time in Major League Baseball history that a father simultaneously managed two of his sons. <br><br> After five and a half seasons with the Orioles, Ripken, who would later return to Baltimore for a year, played for Texas, Cleveland, and Detroit. In 1988, he was second among American League second basemen in double plays turned (100). At the plate, Ripken led the Baltimore Orioles in hitting with a .291 average and 28 doubles in 1990. Ripken, a second baseman by trade, had a fielding percentage of .9927 in 1992, the best of any Major League second baseman that season, and his career fielding percentage at second base (.987) ranks among baseball&#x2019;s all-time leaders. Ripken was voted by his peers as one of the players most likely to manage a big league team. <br><br> Ripken is the co-owner and executive vice president of Ripken Baseball Inc., a baseball sales and marketing company founded in 1999 and based in Baltimore. Ripken is involved in all aspects of the business and regularly instructs at youth camps and coaching clinics. Through his work with these programs, he has become recognized as one of America&#x2019;s premiere baseball instructors. Ripken also is involved in the continued development of the Ripken Academy in Aberdeen, Maryland, and the management of Ripken Baseball&#x2019;s minor league teams in Aberdeen and Augusta, Georgia. <br><br> Ripken lives in Fallston, Maryland, with his wife, Candace, and his children, Miranda, Anna, Reese, and Jack. <br><br> <b>Scott Lowe</b> joined Ripken Baseball in 1999 after eight years working in college sports publicity. Lowe initially served as the general manager of the company&#x2019;s camps and clinics division, developing Ripken Baseball&#x2019;s youth camps, coaching clinics, and other instructional programs. Presently he writes and designs Ripken Baseball&#x2019;s <i>Coach&#x2019;s Clipboard</i> e-newsletter, which is distributed to amateur baseball coaches around the world on a monthly basis. He also oversees the creation and distribution of Ripken Baseball instructional products and is involved in the development and implementation of the company&#x2019;s coaching education and other baseball instructional programs. <br><br> After graduating summa cum laude from the University of Maryland College of Journalism in 1991, Lowe spent two years as an athletic communications assistant at Princeton University. He was the assistant director of sports information and served as the athletics marketing coordinator at Drexel University in Philadelphia from 1993 to 1995 before returning to the Baltimore area to become the assistant director of athletic communications at Loyola College. Lowe served in that capacity before being promoted to the position of head sports information director in 1997. Lowe left Loyola in 1998 to form his own baseball camp business prior to joining Ripken Baseball in September 1999. <br><br> In addition to his full-time position at Ripken Baseball, he has served for three years as the head coach of varsity baseball at the Park School in Baltimore, compiling a 45&#x2013;19 record and leading the Bruins to three consecutive MIAA B Conference playoff appearances, including a trip to the 2006 championship game, after the school had failed to reach the postseason the previous seven years. <br><br> Lowe resides in Owings Mills, Maryland, with his wife, Robin, and children, Devin and Sydney.</p><h2>Christina Katerina and the Box</h2><p>The day the refrigerator arrives in its large brown carton, Christina Katerina and her mother are both excited, but for very different reasons.

The series is the first to air since 1968 that chronicles the full sweep of 500 years of African American history, from the origins of slavery on the African continent and the arrival of the first black conquistador, Juan Garrido, in Florida in 1513, through five centuries of remarkable historic events right up to today&#x2014;when Barack Obama is serving his second term as President, yet our country remains deeply divided by race and class. The book explores these topics in even more detail than possible in the television series, and examines many other fascinating matters as well, such as the ethnic origins&#x2014;and the regional and cultural diversity&#x2014;of the Africans whose enslavement led to the creation of the African American people. It delves into the multiplicity of cultural institutions, political strategies, and religious and social perspectives that African Americans have created in the half a millennium since their African ancestors first arrived on these shores. Like the television series, this book guides readers on an engaging journey through the Black Atlantic world&#x2014;from Africa and Europe to the Caribbean, Latin America, and the United States&#x2014;to shed new light on what it has meant, and means, to be an African American. By highlighting the complex internal debates and class differences within the Black Experience in this country, readers will learn that the African American community, which black abolitionist Martin R. Delany described as a "nation within a nation," has never been a truly uniform entity, and that its members have been debating their differences of opinion and belief from their very first days in this country. The road to freedom for black people in America has not been linear; rather, much like the course of a river, it has been full of loops and eddies, slowing and occasionally reversing current. Ultimately, this book emphasizes the idea that African American history encompasses multiple continents and venues, and must be viewed through a transnational perspective to be fully understood.</p><p>Henry Louis Gates, Jr., is the Alphonse Fletcher University Professor and director of the W. E. B. Du Bois Institute for African and American Research at Harvard University. He is the author of 16 books, including Life Upon These Shores: Looking at African American History, 1513&#x2013;2008 and Tradition and the Black Atlantic, and has made 12 documentaries, including Finding Your Roots, Black in Latin America, and Looking for Lincoln.

Henry Louis Gates, Jr., and Donald Yacovone brilliantly recount the story of people of African descent in mainland North America across some five centuries with deep knowledge of the evolution of the African American experience and great sensitivity to its complexity. Few accounts better capture the changing texture of black life, as black men and women remade their society on new ground."<br>&#x2014; Ira Berlin, professor, University of Maryland, and the author of Making African America: Four Great Migrations<br><br>"THE AFRICAN AMERICANS: MANY RIVERS TO CROSS is an ambitious and original book and the companion to the documentary film that demonstrates how thoroughly North America, and what became the United States, has been shaped by four centuries of African American experience on these shores, in our fields and cities, and in our legislative halls. Gates and Yacovone provide a distinctive vision and voice that carries a huge and complex story. Our language, our migrations, our music, our art and poetry, the ways we walk and talk, our dreams and nightmares, our social movements, the great pivots and changes in our political and constitutional history, our very imaginations as Americans are forever products of the African American stories flowing through our bloodstreams and moving across our landscapes. We are all the products of the slavery and the freedom that this film series presents.

Now, in celebration of Berry's extraordinary six-decade-long career, Library of America presents a two-volume boxed set edition of his nonfiction writings prepared in close consultation with the author.&nbsp;<br><br>Here in full are such landmark books as&nbsp;<i>The Unsettling of America</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Life Is a Miracle</i>, along with generous selections from more than a dozen other volumes, revealing as never before the evolution of Berry's thoughts and concerns as a farmer, neighbor, citizen, teacher, activist, and ecological philosopher. Throughout he demonstrates that our existence is always connected to the land, and that even in a modern global economy local farming is essential to the flourishing of our culture, to healthy living and stable communities, and indeed to the continuing survival of the human species. Berry's essays remain timely, even urgent today, and will resonate with anyone interested in our relationship to the natural world and especially with a younger, politically engaged generation invested in the future welfare of the planet.<br><br><b>LIBRARY OF AMERICA</b> is an independent nonprofit cultural organization founded in 1979 to preserve our nation&#x2019;s literary heritage by publishing, and keeping permanently in print, America&#x2019;s best and most significant writing.

About a year ago, she came by for a strong cup of tea and some gossip while the kids chased each other around the backyard. After the cups were emptied and the town scuttlebutt was exchanged, she looked at her watch and declared: '?Well, time to go home and burn the dinner.'? And she wasn't kidding. She was already anticipating utter failure even before turning on the stove. Was this fatalism? Realism? Both?<br><br>We're the first to admit that cooking regularly'"or more accurately, having to cook regularly'"can be stressful and tedious. Even if you are someone who truly relishes cooking, there are likely days when you just want someone else to do it for you. Further complicating the issue is that cooking (particularly for those you love) isn't just a logistical feat'"an equation involving time, ingredients, budgeting, skill, and desire. It's also an emotional endeavor. You, the cook, are putting yourself out there. You are making something that will feed and nourish someone. How will they react? Will they chew mutely? Tell you that this is the most delicious pot pie they've ever eaten? Admit that they prefer Grandma's version? Clean their plates and ask for seconds? Or say something like, '?Tomorrow, let's just order in.'?<br><br>Maybe they don't know it, but you will be waiting for some kind of (hopefully positive, but at the very least constructive) response. None of us should underestimate the importance of complimenting, or simply acknowledging someone's cooking. Just knowing that their efforts were appreciated can be enough to inspire the most reluctant cook to keep at it. Even seasoned home cooks and professional chefs puff up from a rave review.<br><br>Our sense is that the aforementioned friend just needed some encouragement rather than a fire extinguisher. Maybe her doomsday attitude was the result of some unsuccessful or lackluster meals. Maybe she doubted her cooking abilities, or felt overwhelmed by the weeknight dinner rush. Sound familiar? We have since talked to many people who've admitted they have little faith in their cooking ability. For anyone who fits into this category, here's what we'd like you to know:<br><br>� YOU ARE NOT ALONE. Every night of the week, there are countless cooks who are stumped by planning a menu, feel challenged at the stove, or grow weary just thinking about getting dinner on the table. Take heart in the power of numbers.<br><br>� WHEN YOU'RE THE COOK, YOU'RE THE BOSS. Sure, you can prepare extra vegetables or a bigger salad for the vegetarian, or reserve some unsauced pasta for the picky eater, or leave the salmon off the plate of the fish hater, but don't turn into everyone's short-order cook.<br><br>� START SIMPLY. Before you tackle osso buco, work on a brag-worthy vinaigrette. Move on from there.<br><br>� EVERYONE MESSES UP. Keep calm, carry on, learn from your mistakes.<br><br>� BREATHE. When things get stressful in the kitchen, take a deep breath, ask for help when you need it, and pat yourself on the back no matter how the meal turns out.<br><br>� BE THE COOK YOU WANT TO BE. Just because you weren't tied to your grandmother's apron strings or were raised on frozen chicken nuggets doesn't mean it's too late to become an excellent home cook. Anyone who wants to do it, can. Just be determined, open-minded, and persistent.<br><br>� FIND THE JOY. Cooking should be fun, empowering even. Put on your favorite music, pour a glass of wine, admire how a sharp knife slices through a ripe tomato, savor the aroma of caramelizing onions, congratulate yourself on how evenly you seared the pork chops. When you start to enjoy the process of cooking, everything else gets easier, too.</p><h2>Out of the Box: 25 Cardboard Engineering Projects for Makers (DK Activity Lab)</h2><p><p>Twenty-five interactive cardboard model projects that engage kids' creativity and "out of the box" thinking skills through hands-on learning and the application of science-based principles.</p><p>Kids can bring old cardboard to life and build recycled creations they can play with, sit in, and wear.</p><p>Supporting STEAM education initiatives and the Maker Movement, <i>Out of the Box</i> includes 25 interactive cardboard model projects to inspire kids' creativity through engaged and hands-on learning, and, as the founder of Maker Faire Dale Dougherty says, "to realize with their hands what they can imagine in their minds."</p><p>From small-scale gifts to large constructions, author and award-winning paper engineer Jemma Westing uses clear, step-by-step instructions to show kids how to make dinosaurs, masks, race cars, and so much more, and inspirational images encourage them to make their own unique models when they are feeling more confident.

In 2013, Jemma set up a not-for-profit initiative called BrilliantBuilds, which runs free workshops to encourage children to create amazing things with recycled cardboard.</p>Gr 3 Up&#x2014;Westing explores the art of crafting and building with recycled cardboard packaging. Moving beyond typical dollhouses, playhouses, and race cars, the author provides detailed projects that will help kids develop fine motor skills through cutting, drawing, rolling, bending, folding, and more. The crafts spark creativity and inquiry and move students beyond storebought toys. The content spans the seasons: the "ring toss challenge" and "balancing butterflies" are great options for spring and summer, while children will enjoy making the "cardboard theater" on colder days. The colorful imagery and thorough instructions will pique the interest of upper elementary students and older kids alike. Younger children could complete these crafts with assistance, and these projects would also fit well with art and math lessons on shape, proportion, and ratios. Projects such as the "hero's helmet" and "pharaoh's finery" would supplement literature and history classes. The few photos feature a diverse group of children.

For the past four months Luke has lived among others, using the identity of Lee Grant, at the Hendricks School for Boys. But just as things are finally starting to go right, Lee's little brother Smits arrives at the school and Luke finds himself caught in a tangle of lies that gets more complex with every passing day. <br> Can Luke trust Smits to keep his secret?

Mr. Hendricks wants to see you!"<br><br>Such a summons would have terrified Luke Garner only a few months earlier. When he'd first come to Hendricks School for Boys, the thought of having to talk to any grown-up, let alone the headmaster, would have turned him into a stammering, quaking fool desperately longing for a place to hide.<br><br>But that was back in April, and this was August. A lot had happened between April and August.<br><br>Now Luke just waved off the rising tide of "ooh's" from his friends in math class. <br><br>"What'd you do, L.? Have you been sneaking out to the woods again?" his friend John taunted him.<br><br>"Settle down, class," the teacher, Mr. Rees, said mildly. "You may be excused, Mr., uh, Mr...."<br><br>Luke didn't wait for Mr. Rees to try to remember his name. Names were slippery things at Hendricks School anyway. Luke, like all his friends, was registered under a different name from what he had grown up with. So it was always hard to know what to call people.<br><br>Luke edged his way past his classmates' desks and slipped out the door. His friend Trey, who had delivered the message from Mr. Hendricks, was waiting for him.<br><br>"What's this about?" Luke asked as the two fell into step together, walking down the hall.<br><br>"I don't know. I just do what he tells me," Trey said with a dispirited shrug.<br><br>Sometimes Luke wanted to take Trey by the shoulders, shake him, and yell, "Think for yourself! Open your eyes! Live a little!" Twelve years of hiding in a tiny room had turned Trey into a human turtle, always ready to pull back into his shell at the slightest hint of danger.<br><br>But Mr. Hendricks had taken a liking to Trey and was working with him privately. That was why Trey was running errands for him today.<br><br>Trey looked furtively over at Luke. His dark hair hung down into his eyes. "Do you suppose it's -- you know -- time?"<br><br>Luke didn't have to ask what Trey meant. Sometimes it seemed like everyone at Hendricks School was just holding his breath, waiting. Waiting for a day when none of the boys would be illegal anymore, when they could all reclaim their rightful names, when they could go back to their rightful families without fear that the Population Police would catch them. But both Luke and Trey knew that that day wouldn't come easily. And Luke, at least, had promised to do everything he could to bring it about.<br><br>His stomach churned. The fear he thought he'd outgrown reached him at last.<br><br>"Did he say...did Mr. Hendricks say...," he stammered. What if Mr. Hendricks had a plan for Luke to help with? What if that plan required more courage than Luke had?<br><br>Trey went back to looking down at the polished tile floor.<br><br>"Mr. Hendricks didn't say anything except, 'Go get your buddy L. out of math class and tell him to come see me,'" Trey said.<br><br>"Oh," Luke said.<br><br>They reached the end of the hall, and Luke pushed open the heavy wood door to the outside. Trey winced, as he always did anytime he was exposed to sunshine, fresh air, or anything else outdoors. But Luke breathed in gratefully. Luke had spent his first twelve years on his family's farm; some of his fondest memories involved the feeling of warm dirt on his bare feet, sunshine on the back of his neck, a hoe in his hand -- and his parents and brothers around him.<br><br>But it didn't do to think much about his parents and brothers anymore. When he'd accepted his fake identity, he'd had to leave them and the farm behind. And even when he'd been with them, he'd had to live like a shadow or a ghost, something no one else outside the family knew about.<br><br>Once when his middle brother, Mark, was in first grade, he'd accidentally slipped and mentioned Luke's name at school.<br><br>"I had to tell the teacher that Mark just had an imaginary friend named Luke," Luke's mother had told him. "But I worried about that for months afterward. I was so scared the teacher would report you, and the Population Police would come and take you away. I'm just glad that a lot of little kids do have imaginary friends."<br><br>She'd bitten her lip telling Luke that story. Luke could still see the strained expression on her face. She hadn't even told him about that episode until the day before he left the farm and his family for good. By then she'd meant the story as assurance, he knew -- assurance that he was doing the right thing by leaving.<br><br>At the time, Luke hadn't known what to make of that story. It just added to the jumble of confused thoughts and fears in his head. But now -- now that story made him angry. It wasn't fair that he'd had to be invisible. It wasn't fair that his brother couldn't talk about him. It wasn't fair that the Government had made him illegal simply because he was a third child and the Government thought families should have no more than two.<br><br>Luke stepped out into the sunshine feeling strangely happy to be so angry. It felt good to be so sure about what he thought, so totally convinced that he was right and the Government was wrong. And if Mr. Hendricks really did have a plan for Luke, it'd be good to hang on to this righteous anger.<br><br>The two boys climbed down an imposing number of marble steps. Luke noticed that Trey glanced back longingly at the school more than once. Not Luke. Hendricks had no windows -- to accommodate the fears of kids like Trey -- and Luke always felt slightly caged anytime he was inside.<br><br>They walked on down the lane to a house half hidden in bushes. Mr. Hendricks was waiting for them at the door.<br><br>"Come on in," he said heartily to Luke. "Trey, you can go on back to school and see about learning something for once." That was a joke -- Trey had done nothing but read while he'd been in hiding, so he knew as much about some subjects as the teachers did.<br><br>Luke opened the door, and Mr. Hendricks rolled back in his wheelchair to give Luke room to pass. When he'd first met Mr. Hendricks, Luke had been awkward around him, particularly because of the wheelchair. But now Luke practically forgot that Mr. Hendricks's lower legs were missing. Going into the living room, Luke automatically stepped out of the way of Mr. Hendricks's wheels.<br><br>"The other boys will find this out soon enough," Mr. Hendricks said. "But I wanted to tell you first, to give you time to adjust."<br><br>"Adjust to what?" Luke asked, sitting down on a couch.<br><br>"Having your brother here at school with you."<br><br>"My brother?" Luke repeated. "You mean Matthew or Mark..." He tried to picture either of his rough, wild older brothers in their faded jeans and flannel shirts walking up the marble stairs at Hendricks. If he felt caged at the windowless school, his brothers would feel handcuffed, pinned down, thoroughly imprisoned. And how could Mother and Dad possibly afford to send them here? Why would they want to?<br><br>"No, <i>Lee,"</i> Mr. Hendricks said, stressing the fake name that Luke had adopted when he'd come out of hiding. Luke knew that he should be grateful that the parents of a boy named Lee Grant had donated his name and identity after the real Lee died in a skiing accident. The Grants were Barons -- really rich people -- so Luke's new identity was an impressive one indeed. But Luke didn't like to be called Lee, didn't like even to be reminded that he was supposed to be somebody else.<br><br>Mr. Hendricks was peering straight at Luke, waiting for Luke to catch on.<br><br>"I said your brother," Mr. Hendricks repeated. "Smithfield William Grant. <i>You</i> call him Smits. And he's coming here tomorrow."<br><br>Copyright � 2003 by Margaret Peterson Haddix</p><h2>Ultimate Guide to Kink: BDSM, Role Play and the Erotic Edge</h2><p>The Ultimate Guide to Kink is the first major guide to BDSM in a generation&#x2015;a bold and sexy collection of essays that run the gamut from expert how-to tutorials to provocative essays that delve into complex questions about desire, power, and pleasure.

But with sin came a world filled with sexual brokenness. Thankfully, God is always in the business of restoration.</p><p>This book offers hope for both the sexually immoral and the sexually victimized, pointing us all to the grace of Jesus Christ, who mercifully intervenes each moment in our lifelong journey toward renewal. Author David Powlison casts a vision for the key to deep transformation, better than anything the world has to offer&#x2015;not just fresh resolve, not just flimsy forgiveness, not just simple formulas, but true, lasting mercy from God, who is making all things new.</p></p><p><p><strong>David Powlison</strong>&nbsp;(1949&#x2013;2019)&nbsp;was a teacher, a counselor, and the executive director of the Christian Counseling &amp; Educational Foundation for many years. He&nbsp;received&nbsp;his PhD from the University of Pennsylvania&nbsp;and was also the senior editor of the&nbsp;<em>Journal of Biblical Counseling</em>. He wrote a number of&nbsp;books, including&nbsp;<em>How Does Sanctification Work?</em>;&nbsp;<em>Making All Things New</em>; and&nbsp;<em>God's Grace in Your Suffering</em>.</p><p>Late Executive Director, Christian Counseling &amp;&nbsp;Educational Foundation</p><p>&#x201c;In <i>Making All Things New</i>, David Powlison offers us a gem, a helping hand, and a sure bet. True to the Bible, he is a realist. He shows us how a Christ-redefined life changes what sex means. This book is not pie in the sky. It is feet on the floor. Where do you or people you love struggle? Take David&#x2019;s hand and walk this road with the Lord. He shows us all how besetting sexual sin is symptomatic of something yet hidden. Repentance of sin commences sexual repatterning, and this accessible book will take you into that dark place with the light of Christ. As the world clamors about sexual rights and privileges, the people of God must show up with something beyond moral platitudes or behavioral modification programs. We already have a Savior who knows how to rescue his people. And now we have an accessible guidebook, one that helps the sexual sinner recognize the deeper battle, and one that helps parents and allies apply faith to the dire facts of being held captive.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Rosaria Butterfield,</strong>&nbsp;Former Professor of English, Syracuse University; author, <em>The Gospel Comes with a House Key</em></p><p>&#x201c;Sexual sin can seem like a trap from which one can never escape. David Powlison brings good news to those caught in sexual sin, and to those who have been sinned against. This book addresses sexual sin not with shame and moralizing but with the gospel of Jesus Christ. We all need to hear the message of this book.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Russell Moore,</strong>&nbsp;President, The Ethics &amp; Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention</p><p>&#x201c;David Powlison&#x2019;s ministry to all fallen humanity is evident in this book. He calls those impacted by the pain and sorrow of sexual struggle and sin to repentance while finding refuge in the arms of our faithful Savior. Likewise, he presents to all who bear God&#x2019;s image a picture of what God is doing to restore the beauty of sexual intimacy in the lives of his people.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Timothy Geiger,</strong>&nbsp;President, Harvest USA; author, <em>What to Do When Your Child Says, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m Gay&#x201d;</em></p><p>&#x201c;Finally, a gospel-centered book for both genders that beautifully brings the hope of Christ to bear upon broken sexuality. Women, like men, have been sinned against sexually and have pursued their own expressions of sinful sexual behavior. <i>Making All Things New</i> masterfully achieves the author&#x2019;s vision to be candid and hopeful regarding the real possibility of life transformation and to restored joy to women and men bound up in the shame and pain of sexual brokenness.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Ellen Mary Dykas,</strong> Women&#x2019;s Ministry Coordinator, Harvest USA; editor, <em>Sexual Sanity for Women</em></p><p>&#x201c;I love David Powlison. Few living authors have shaped my approach to gospel growth, and even preaching, more than he has. Gifted Christian counselors like Powlison read the Bible in a unique way, laying open both the truth of Scripture and the foundations of the human heart, showing where one intersects the other. I have to think that if you heard Jesus preach in the first century, you would have assumed you were listening to a very gifted counselor. In this remarkably insightful book, Powlison offers gospel hope to those who have sinned through sex and those who have suffered through it. I am excited to provide this resource to people dealing with an area in which many first experience their need of the gospel.&#x201d; <br>&#x2015;<strong>J. D. Greear,</strong> President, Southern Baptist Convention; author, <em>Not God Enough</em>; Pastor, The Summit Church, Raleigh-Durham, North Carolina</p><p>&#x201c;<i>Making All Things New</i> is a helpful perspective for understanding a common theme in life. David Powlison will help you to see sexual transgression and sexual affliction under the unique lens of the gospel, and will guide you to find hope in the purity and the cleanness of Christ. Jesus makes all things new, even our sexual experience.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Alexandre Chiaradia Mendes,</strong>&nbsp;Pastor, Maranatha Baptist Church, S�o Jos� dos Campos, Brazil; Director of Vision and Expansion, Brazilian Association of Biblical Counselors; coauthor, <em>Dating and Engagement That God Desires</em></p><p>&#x201c;Nothing hinders joy more than sexual misuse and abuse, and nothing troubles more people more profoundly today than sexual deception, corruption, and brokenness.

Abraham believes that anyone can advance in life by tapping into hidden assets and developing the right mindset. He writes, "You are surrounded by simple, obvious solutions that can dramatically increase your income, power, influence and success. The problem is, you just don't see them." Over the course of 21 chapters, he shows how to get ahead by treating bosses and clients as valued friends; find better and more exciting ways of doing things; develop "unique selling propositions"; persuade people to follow your lead; master the art of selling on the telephone; craft a formal referral system; sell on the Internet; and forge strong, established business relationships. Abraham's central theme is that everyone is in sales. In almost any profession, people must be skilled at selling themselves and their ideas, not just their company's product or service.

It is considered the "first known autobiography written by a Native American woman." Anthropologist Omer Stewart described it as "one of the first and one of the most enduring ethnohistorical books written by an American Indian," frequently cited by scholars. Following the publication of the book, Winnemucca toured the Eastern United States, giving lectures about her people in New England, Pennsylvania, and Washington, D.C. She returned to the West, founding a private school for Native American children in Lovelock, Nevada.</p><p>Sarah Winnemucca Hopkins (1841&#x2013;1891) was notable for being the first Native American woman known to secure a copyright and to publish in the English language. She was also known by her married name, Sarah Winnemucca Hopkins, under which she was published. Her book, Life Among the Paiutes: Their Wrongs and Claims, is an autobiographical account of her people during their first forty years of contact with explorers and settlers. Sarah was a person of two worlds. At the time of her birth her people had only very limited contact with Euro-Americans; however she spent much of her adult life in white society. Like many people of two worlds, she may be judged harshly in both contexts. Many Paiutes view her as a collaborator who helped the U.S. Army kill her people. Modern historians view her book as an important primary source, but one that is deliberately misleading in many instances. Despite this, Sarah has recently received much positive attention for her activism. She was inducted into the Nevada Writers Hall of Fame in 1993, and in 2005 a statue of her by sculptor Benjamin Victor was added to the National Statuary Hall Collection in the U.S. Capitol.<br>&#x201c;For students of Western American history, this book is invaluable. Rarely do we have firsthand accounts of events of such importance; even more rarely are these accounts written by Native Americans who participated in them; and, still rarer are the accounts written by Native American women.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Journal of the West</i></p><h2>The Secrets of Dance Music Production</h2><p>The world's leading electronic music production magazine delivers the definitive guide to making cutting-edge dance music.

He was pleased with the first part. He liked &#x2018;Affectionate is your dog&#x2019; and &#x2018;Annoying is a loose boot in a muddy place&#x2019; and so on, and he smiled at &#x2018;Bulky is a big bag of boxes.&#x2019; As a matter of fact, there was no trouble with any of the A&#x2019;s or B&#x2019;s and the C&#x2019;s were fine too, especially &#x2018;Calamitous is saying no to the King.&#x2019; But then we got to &#x2018;Delicious is fried fish&#x2019; and he said no, I&#x2019;d have to change that. He doesn&#x2019;t care for fried fish. The General of the Armies was standing there and he said that, as far as he was concerned, Delicious is a mug of beer, and the Queen said no, Delicious is a Christmas pudding, and then the King said nonsense, everyone knew the most delicious thing is an apple, and they all began quarreling. Not just the three of them&#x2014;the whole court. When I left, they were all yelling and shouting and shaking their fists.

Gaylen ran to the window and looked down. People were pouring out of the castle door to form a noisy ring around two men shoving each other about on the grass. After a moment, one knocked the other flat, shouted &#x201c;Plums!&#x201d; and strode triumphantly back inside, followed by the cheering crowd.

Dramatically challenging our preconceptions of the hooded Klansmen responsible for establishing a Jim Crow racial hierarchy in the 1870s South, this &#x201c;second Klan&#x201d; spread in states principally above the Mason-Dixon line by courting xenophobic fears surrounding the flood of immigrant &#x201c;hordes&#x201d; landing on American shores. &#x201c;Part cautionary tale, part expose&#x201d; (<em>Washington Post</em>), The Second Coming of the KKK &#x201c;illuminates the surprising scope of the movement&#x201d; (<em>The New Yorker</em>); the Klan attracted four-to-six-million members through secret rituals, manufactured news stories, and mass &#x201c;Klonvocations&#x201d; prior to its collapse in 1926&#x2015;but not before its potent ideology of intolerance became part and parcel of the American tradition. A &#x201c;must-read&#x201d; (<em>Salon</em>) for anyone looking to understand the current moment, <em>The Second Coming of the KKK</em> offers &#x201c;chilling comparisons to the present day&#x201d; (<em>New York Review of Books</em>). 8 pages of illustrations</p><p>Linda Gordon, winner of two Bancroft Prizes and the Los Angeles Times Book Prize, is the author of The Second Coming of the KKK, Dorothea Lange and Impounded, and the coauthor of Feminism Unfinished. She is the Florence Kelley Professor of History at New York University and lives in New York and Madison, Wisconsin.&#x201c;The Klan of the 1920s, less violent but far more wide�spread, is a different story, and offers some chilling comparisons to the present day. . . A thoughtful explanation of the Klan&#x2019;s appeal in the fast-urbanizing America of the 1920s, which was leaving behind an earlier nation based, in imagined memory, on self-sufficient yeoman farmers, proud blue-collar workers, and virtuous small-town businessmen, all of them going to the same white-steepled church on Sunday.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Adam Hoschschild, <em>New York Review of Books</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;A must-read for anyone wondering over the last several months how we ended up as a country&#x2015;with the first African-American president not even a year out of office&#x2015;facing a group of golf shirt-wearing young white men marching onto the campus of a prestigious university carrying torches and chanting &#x2018;Jews will not replace us&#x201d; . . . . Gordon documents not only the mechanics of how the Ku Klux Klan roared back to power, both socially and politically, in the 1920s but why. The parallels between then and now, branding differences aside, could not be more evident. To say it one more time for those who wish it weren&#x2019;t so, the past isn&#x2019;t dead and it&#x2019;s not even past; and those who don&#x2019;t learn from it are doomed to repeat it. . . . Histories like Gordon&#x2019;s should help Americans understand the roots of these toxic ideologies, as well as the circumstances that help them flourish, in order to better spot them when they sprout.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Erin Keane, <em>Salon</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;<em>The Second Coming of the KKK</em> illustrates how the 1920s reboot of the Ku Klux Klan was regarded as rather ordinary and respectable, much like today's efforts to make everyday racism, sexism, and anti-Semitism acceptable again. . . With the help of a couple of savvy public relations pros, Klan membership spread like wildfire, enveloping Northerners and Westerners in love with the idea of defining themselves by what they were not.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Deborah Douglas, <em>Vice</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Gordon is a thorough and perceptive historian . . . There&#x2019;s more to <em>The Second Coming of the KKK</em> than grim d�ja vu. There are lessons too.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Randy Dotinga, <em>Christian Science Monitor</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Sharply argued. . . . [Gordon] encourages readers to draw bold lines between the political milieu of the Second Klan and our current predicament.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Todd Moye, <em>Texas Observer</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Set aside your preconceptions about the Klan, from the era of Reconstruction. As the distinguished historian Linda Gordon demonstrates in this chilling account, the KKK of the 1920s was urban, northern, and modern. Its wizards and dragons used the latest tools of mass advertising to spread their message of &#x2018;true Americanism&#x2019;: racial purity, religious intolerance, and opposition to immigration. Its members, one in six of whom were women, favored women&#x2019;s suffrage. Its campaign of terror ended not long after it began, but it left on American politics its dark mark.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Jill Lepore, author of <em>The Secret History of Wonder Woman</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;<em>The Second Coming of the KKK</em> reminds us that we Americans bid good riddance to serial aberrations in the civic and social life of our republic repeatedly, only to learn that these phenomena are as American as apple pie. Gordon&#x2019;s timely, crisply written, indispensable primer helps explain why another aberration is now upon us.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>David Levering Lewis, Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning author of <em>W.E.B. Du Bois: A Biography</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;A first-rate historian can show us the past in a way that clarifies the present. That&#x2019;s what Linda Gordon does here...[<em>The Second Coming of the KKK</em>] reminds us that the sentiments that powered the reprise of the Klan have never been entirely absent from American life, and cannot be understood as an aberrant strain that might be entirely eliminated from the national character.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Nicholas Lemann, author of <em>Redemption</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;An excellent historical treatment of an almost forgotten yet very dangerous period of hate in America. What a history lesson for today&#x2019;s electorate.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Morris Dees, founder of the Southern Poverty Law Center</strong><br><br>&#x201c;At once thoughtful, fair, and deeply troubling, <em>The Second Coming of the KKK</em> exhibits the analytical wisdom of a master historian who sharply reminds us that popular mass mobilizations can be instruments of depredation.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Ira Katznelson, author of the Bancroft Prize&#x2013;winning <em>Fear Itself</em></strong></p><h2>The Korean Skincare Bible: The ultimate guide to K-beauty secrets</h2><p><b> The Ultimate Guide to K-Beauty Secrets </b><br><br><i>The Korean Skincare Bible</i> is much more than a beauty product guide it is a lifestyle, a ritual and a philosophy.

She took my hand.</p><p>&#x201c;Where are your sisters?&#x201d; I asked as I scanned the area for them.</p><p>&#x201c;Lori took Carolyn to the bathroom.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Go and get them, will you?

You fetch your sisters, and I&#x2019;ll meet you by the seal pool.&#x201d;</p><p>She scampered off toward the rear of the lion house and the bathrooms. I watched her until she disappeared around the corner of the building.</p><p>Kelly is my middle daughter. She&#x2019;s frail and slight, and somewhat shy. She reminds me greatly of myself when I was eight and unprepared. And the moment reminds me of the days when this place, this zoo, was my source of refuge, my home. It may sound strange, but I sought comfort here. I hid from fear and loneliness here. I hid from pain and unkindness here.</p><p>I sat on a bench near the seal pool and pressed my hands deep into my pockets. I breathed in the crisp cold air of these last days of autumn, and I remembered....</p><p><b>1</b></p><p>It&#x2019;s unlucky to step on lines and cracks in the sidewalk, but Mom didn&#x2019;t seem to understand this. On the long walk from the subway station, she kept tugging at my arm and telling me to walk straight. It had rained for most of the morning, but now, in the early evening, only a light mist lay heavily in the air. The dark gray smoke from the chimneys along this Brooklyn street didn&#x2019;t have far to travel before blending neatly into the low night sky.</p><p>We were on our way to visit with one of Mom&#x2019;s friends. Since it wasn&#x2019;t often I got a chance to be with her all by myself, I didn&#x2019;t mind the wet weather, or her quiet mood, or her tugging at my arm. We walked along at a quick pace. I asked a number of times if we were late, but she didn&#x2019;t answer me. Her usually smooth-skinned forehead was somewhat wrinkled, and her dark eyebrows were bent into a slight frown.</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong, Mom?&#x201d;</p><p>Her answer was another tug at my arm as I tried to avoid the next line. She released the tight grip she had on my small hand to refer to a piece of paper she had pulled from her pocket.</p><p>&#x201c;Are we there yet?&#x201d; I asked. I looked up for her answer, but there was none. She studied the paper and then the building numbers.</p><p>She regripped my hand and trugged again. The wet ground was beginning to make its way in through the hole in my left shoe. I felt my sock sticking to my toes as I tried wiggling and walking at the same time.</p><p>She stopped suddenly and leaned down. She brushed back some hairs sticking up from the top of my head.</p><p>&#x201c;Now, be a good boy.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I will, Mom.&#x201d; That was my standard answer whether I planned to be good or not.</p><p>We climbed a short flight of worn steps bounded by two wrought-iron handrails. We entered the old red brick building through a highly polished wooden door that squeaked as it opened. We were met in the entranceway by a small nun dressed all in white. She nodded to Mom and smiled at me as she greeted us. Her wire-rimmed eyelgasses sat on the very end of her nose. When she spoke, she looked over the top of them.</p><p>&#x201c;And what&#x2019;s your name, little fella?&#x201d; she asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Jennings,&#x201d; I replied.</p><p>&#x201c;Why, that&#x2019;s a very nice name,&#x201d; she said as she turned to lead us down a very dark and narrow hallway. It was so quiet and still, and the smell of burnt candle wax made me think we were in some sort of a church. Mom often took me or one of my brothers to some new church somewhere.</p><p>I held tightly to Mom&#x2019;s warm hand. We reached the end of the hallway and two wooden benches with red felt cushions.</p><p>&#x201c;Be a good boy and wait here,&#x201d; the little nun said over her glasses. &#x201c;Your mother and I have a few things to discuss.&#x201d;</p><p>I nodded my head as Mom and the nun disappeared into an office and closed the door.</p><p>I was about to sit on the nice felt cushions when I remembered my pants were still damp from the rain. Instead, I stood on my tiptoes and looked out through the colors of a stained-glass window. I closed one eye and moved from one colored glass to the next.</p><p>&#x201c;Jennings!&#x201d; I was jolted away from my world of pink cars and green buildings by the little nun. I turned and regrasped Mom&#x2019;s hand. She looked sad and red-eyed.</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong, Mom?&#x201d;</p><p>She shook her head and squeezed my hand as we walked back down the hall. We stopped at a door about halfway down, and the nun opened it.</p><p>The room was large and blue and filled with noisy children. As we entered, all the children stopped and stared at us. Their silence made me uncomfortable.</p><p>Mom leaned down to help me off with my coat, but then hugged me. She kissed my face a number of times. She took one last swipe at my cowlick. I could see the tears on her lower lid as she forced a smile. She frightened me, so I clung to her arm.</p><p>&#x201c;Mom! What&#x2019;s wrong?&#x201d;</p><p>She brought me close to her once again and hugged me. My coat was still only partway off when she straightened up. She gripped my shoulders to hold me off. In a husky sort of voice she said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be right back.&#x201d;</p><p>She turned and slipped through the open door. The nun followed, closing the door behind her.</p><p>They left me in the middle of what seemed to be a thousand staring eyes. I felt strange and tingly all over. I couldn&#x2019;t move. I left my coat hanging from one shoulder. The eyes kept staring while my mind raced: What&#x2019;s wrong with Mom? Why did she push me away from her? Where is she? Where am I?</p><p>Slowly the children began to resume their play. First some and then all. As they played, I felt more and more as though I could move, but I didn&#x2019;t. When the tension eased, I began to look around the room.</p><p>The blue walls were paint-chipped and peeling. Night had now blackened the other side of two very large frosted windows on one side of the room. Above the worn wooden floor hung about half a dozen globe lamps. A high curb ran all the way around the room. I didn&#x2019;t know what it was for until I saw a little girl nearly run down by a speeding tricycle. The curb was for safety. Around the room, at the edge of the curb, there were four large pillars holding up the whole place. And straight across from me there were two doors with signs over them. One said &#x201c;Boys&#x201d;; and the other said &#x201c;Girls.&#x201d;</p><p>I made my way around to the corner of the room behind one of the pillars. I sat down. I watched the kids playing and fighting. They all seemed to want to ride the few bicycles and tricycles that were there, but only the bigger kids were on them. There was a large purple tricycle I really liked. I wondered how I might get a turn at riding it. Two boys entered the room and headed straight for the tricycle. They abruptly dumped the boy who was on the bike to the floor, and rode off laughing.</p><p>I drew up my legs and folded my arms over them. I laid my head sideways atop my arms and closed my eyes. I was getting sleepy.</p><p>&#x201c;Get up from there!&#x201d; snapped a gruff-sounding nun. She was towering above me and she was angry. &#x201c;What are you doing down there?&#x201d;</p><p>I was startled and groggy. I tried to get to my feet, when she pulled me up by my coat collar.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m waiting for my mother.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Never mind that!&#x201d; She began dragging me across the floor of the now empty room. I had obviously fallen asleep and all the children had gone home.</p><p>&#x201c;But I&#x2019;m waiting for my mother!&#x201d; I garbled out through my tightly grasped coat collar.</p><p>In one great sweep she opened the door marked &#x201c;Boys&#x201d; and flung me through it. I staggered into a pitch-black darkness.</p><p>&#x201c;Get along!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But, Sister...&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Get along!&#x201d;</p><p>She gathered a large chunk of my coat sleeve and arm and lifted part of me off the ground. I was forced through the darkness into a partially lighted room.</p><p>The room was long and narrow. On one side, separated by dark doorways, were small pink lights very close to the floor. They lit the bottom part of the room, making the top part seem dark and endless. Along the other wall, running the entire length of the room, was a row of beds, every two separated by barred windows. I was frightened.</p><p>She pushed me through one of the dark doorways. She flipped a switch, flooding the room with light. It was a bathroom, made of a million tiny white tiles. Floor, ceiling, walls, and everything. The first thing I thought of was Chicklets.</p><p>&#x201c;Your number is twenty-seven. Don&#x2019;t forget it!&#x201d; She pointed to the far side of the room and a row of hooks with numbers above them. Most of the hooks had clothes hanging from them, some of them only pajamas. &#x201c;Do you have a toothbrush?&#x201d;</p><p>Thinking of the one I had at home, I said, &#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Wash, brush, and change. And don&#x2019;t make a mess!&#x201d; She left as quickly as she spoke, and I was glad. I was afraid of her.</p><p>I lifted the pair of pajamas off hook number twenty-seven. I sat on the long wooden bench under the hooks and looked around. There was a row of sinks on one side of the room and a row of toilets on the other. As I changed into the pajamas, I couldn&#x2019;t stop the tears edging toward my eyes. I went over to one of the sinks and turned on the water. It was cold. I wet my face and looked around for a towel. There was none. I dabbed my wet face with my sleeve.</p><p>&#x201c;What are you doing!&#x201d; she screamed as she reentered the room. She really startled me.</p><p>&#x201c;I want my mother,&#x201d; I cried.</p><p>She slapped my face so hard I felt a million needles of heat rush into my face and cheek.</p><p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s gone! Now stop that! Where&#x2019;s your toothbrush?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s...it&#x2019;s...&#x201d; I was in a race between breathing and speaking. &#x201c;...at home.&#x201d;</p><p>From nowhere, she produced a paper-wrapped toothbrush and shoved it at me. I took it and brought it to my mouth to tear off the paper with my teeth. She slapped me again.</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s not the way we do things around here!&#x201d;</p><p>I held my stinging face. &#x201c;I just wanted to take off the&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, that&#x2019;s not the way we do things around here.&#x201d; She left in a huff, mumbling to herself.</p><p>I found some toothpaste on one of the sinks and put some on the paper-wrapped brush. I brushed my teeth. It was yucky, but that&#x2019;s how she wanted it. When I finished brushing I stuck the brush in the back pocket of my hanging brown corduroy pants and went over to the doorway. I peeked out. She was at the far end of the darkened room at a desk with a small lighted lamp. I switched off the bathroom light and approached her. I stood in front of her desk. She ignored me. She got to her feet and brushed past me.</p><p>&#x201c;Come on.&#x201d;</p><p>I followed her down the long row of beds. She stopped at bed number twenty-seven and pointed to it. Without another word she returned to her desk.</p><p>I gathered up the waist part of the pajamas and with great difficulty climbed up and into the very high white metal bed. There were bars at the top and bottom. I slipped beneath the cold sheets. There was a strong smell of rubber and the blanket was itchy.</p><p>I lay faceup trying to see the shapes on the dark ceiling. I could not. I heard an occasional cough and a sniffle. I heard a small voice call out so quietly I almost didn&#x2019;t hear it: &#x201c;Sister Frances.&#x201d;</p><p>I waited for the response, but there was none. A warm tear ran down my cheek and into my ear. Where was I and why was I here? A streetlamp somewhere outside cast eerie shadows across the top of my bedcovers. In the gray light I wondered why Mom hadn&#x2019;t come back for me.</p><p>I awoke to the sounds of children&#x2019;s voices. I opened my eyes and looked around. The room looked different from the night before. It was bigger and brighter and it had a ceiling. Kids were running in all directions. I recognized a lot of them from the playroom. They hadn&#x2019;t gone home after all. There was a chest next to the bed.</p><p>I climbed down from the bed. Sister Frances wasn&#x2019;t at her desk. Instead, there was a younger nun. She was prettier, with dark eyebrows and a dimple on each cheek. She was fastening the shirt buttons for one of the little kids. She was smiling.</p><p>I entered the bathroom. To my relief, all my things were still there. I hung the pajamas on the hook and stuffed the toothbrush into the top pocket. I didn&#x2019;t feel like brushing again. I dabbed a drop of water on each eye and dried with my shirt sleeve. I was too afraid to ask anyone where they got their towels and facecloths from, and besides, I didn&#x2019;t care. Mom would be here soon and I could go home. I put on my street coat and followed some of the boys out of the bathroom. They were lining up in front of the beds, so I did the same. I noticed I was the only one wearing my street coat. I guessed nobody else was leaving but me.</p><p>&#x201c;Why not put your coat on your hook?&#x201d; the nun with the dimples asked as she approached me.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going home,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;Well, we&#x2019;re going to have breakfast first.

She spoke not a word, but rather made a clicking sound with a clicker she held down by her side. I remembered having one of those clickers. I got it in a box of Cracker Jacks. With each click the children responded, and I followed. We shuffled down a maze of hallways until we reached a dining room.</p><p>It was an enormous room, very much like the lunchroom at school. It had rows and rows of tables, with a dozen or so chairs at each table. As we entered the room, we weaved like a snake around the rows of tables; girls entering from the other side did the same. At the sound of a click, we stopped. On the next, we turned. There in front of me was chair number twenty-seven. I sat. A terrible pain ripped into my left ear. Sister Frances had grapped hold of my ear and lifted me out of the chair. She clicked the others to sit before she let go of me.</p><p>&#x201c;Sit when you&#x2019;re supposed to, and not a moment before!&#x201d; She pointed to a spot behind the chair. &#x201c;Now, stand there!&#x201d;</p><p>I stood where she pointed.

Princess Izta had many wealthy suitors but dismissed them all. When a mere warrior, Popoca, promised to be true to her and stay always by her side, Izta fell in love. The emperor promised Popoca if he could defeat their enemy Jaguar Claw, then Popoca and Izta could wed. When Popoca was near to defeating Jaguar Claw, his opponent sent a messenger to Izta saying Popoca was dead. Izta fell into a deep sleep and, upon his return, even Popoca could not wake her. As promised Popoca stayed by her side. So two volcanoes were formed: Iztacc�huatl, who continues to sleep, and Popocat�petl, who spews ash and smoke, trying to wake his love.<br></p><p><b>Duncan Tonatiuh</b>&#x2019;s books have won numerous awards: <i>Diego Rivera</i> won the Pura Belpr� Illustration Award; <i>Pancho Rabbit</i> won two Pura Belpr� Honor awards, for illustration and narrative; <i>Separate Is Never Equal</i> won the prestigious Sibert Honor Award; and <i>Funny Bones</i> won the Sibert Award. He lives in Mexico.PreS-Gr 2&#x2014;Princess Izta is the most beautiful and eligible maiden in the land. One day, a humble warrior named Popoca approaches the princess, offering her the promise of true love and fidelity instead of lavish gifts or material wealth. Izta falls in love with him, even though her father, the emperor, feels Popoca is unsuitable for his royal daughter. He agrees to allow Popoca and Izta to marry, under one condition: Popoca must defeat Jaguar Claw, the infamous ruler of a neighboring land. Popoca fights many battles and defeats Jaguar Claw. But with the help of a bribed messenger, a bitter Jaguar Claw manages to take one last stab at Popoca by tricking Izta into poisoning herself into a deep sleep. Just as he promised, Popoca stays by her side, lying next to her until, as legend has it, two volcanoes are formed: Popocat�petl, meaning smoky mountain, and Iztacc�huatl (sleeping woman). Award-winning author/illustrator Tonatiuh successfully retells this ancient tale using his distinctive and artistic illustrations with spare but effective text. The action battle scenes will excite and captivate, while the images of Popoca kneeling beside Izta in determined wait will stir the hearts of readers. The integration of Nahuatl words (defined with a pronunciation guide in the glossary) into the narrative provides a rich opportunity to introduce and explore another facet of Aztec culture. VERDICT Use this Aztec legend to inspire readers while teaching a bit about dramatic irony; a first purchase for all folklore collections.&#x2014;Natalie Braham, Denver Public Library</p><h2>The Great Railroad Revolution</h2><p><p>America was made by the railroads. The opening of the Baltimore &amp; Ohio line&#x2013;&#x2013;the first American railroad&#x2013;&#x2013;in the 1830s sparked a national revolution in the way that people lived thanks to the speed and convenience of train travel. Promoted by visionaries and built through heroic effort, the American railroad network was bigger in every sense than Europe&#x2019;s, and facilitated everything from long-distance travel to commuting and transporting goods to waging war. It united far-flung parts of the country, boosted economic development, and was the catalyst for America&#x2019;s rise to world-power status.</p><p>Every American town, great or small, aspired to be connected to a railroad and by the turn of the century, almost every American lived within easy access of a station. By the early 1900s, the United States was covered in a latticework of more than 200,000 miles of railroad track and a series of magisterial termini, all built and controlled by the biggest corporations in the land. The railroads dominated the American landscape for more than a hundred years but by the middle of the twentieth century, the automobile, the truck, and the airplane had eclipsed the railroads and the nation started to forget them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In <i>The Great Railroad Revolution</i>, renowned railroad expert Christian Wolmar tells the extraordinary story of the rise and the fall of the greatest of all American endeavors, and argues that the time has come for America to reclaim and celebrate its often-overlooked rail heritage.<br> &nbsp;</p></p><p><p><b>Christian Wolmar</b> is a writer and broadcaster, specializing in transportation matters. He has written for major British newspapers for many years and has contributed to many other publications, including the <i>New York Times</i> and <i>Newsday</i>. His most recent books are <i>Blood, Iron, and Gold</i> and <i>Engines of War</i>.<br><br> &nbsp;</p><p><b>Daily Telegraph (UK)</b><br>&#x201c;This is the ninth book that Wolmar has written about trains of various kinds.&nbsp; It is certainly among the best, incorporating, alongside some gripping and downright bizarre reports upon a century-long stretch of vastly improved transport and soaring economic growth... an account of the &#x2018;sheer, almost unbelievable scale of corruption and graft&#x2019; from which brutal opportunists like Huntington, Stanford and Gould minted their undeserved millions... Enjoyably anecdotal.&#x201d;</p><b>Sunday Times (UK)</b>"(A) passionate and masterly history."&nbsp;<b><i>The Guardian</i></b>&#x201c;Christian Wolmar is in love with railways. He writes constantly and passionately about them. He is their wisest, most detailed historian and a constant prophet of their rebirth. So America, from 1830 on, from a few, tentative miles of track to a quarter of a million miles only 80 years later, is a story that grips his imagination... the tangle of failure, frailty and faint-heartedness he unpicks here goes far beyond mere romance: it resonates and crosses borders of national experience; it tells us something vital about the nature of railways we still struggle to learn to this day... If you love the hum of the wheels and of history, then Christian Wolmar is your man.&#x201d;<br><br><b><i>Camden &nbsp;</i></b><b><i>New Journal</i></b><b>&nbsp;(London, UK) </b>&#x201c;In his new book, his ninth, a comprehensive, compulsive and compelling epic story of the American railroad, Christian Wolmar reveals how that revolution actually fuelled the nation&#x2019;s rise to a world-status power with its new found ability to glue itself together into a cohesive economic force.... Wolmar&#x2019;s magnificent saga tells graphically how it all happened, then collapsed as man&#x2019;s love affair with trains transferred first to cars, then to airplanes and possibly next lock on to rockets into space....What is outstanding in his fascinating research is the detail, an encyclopedia of railway lore, myth and anecdote that could &#x2013; and has &#x2013; sustained many a film, TV series and novel.&#x201d;<br><br><b><i>Publishers Weekly</i></b><i><br></i>&#x201c;In a volume that will delight train buffs&#x2014;and hopefully others&#x2014;English historian and railway expert Wolmar... examines the rise and fall of railroads in America, with a detailed look at how they influenced and directed the growth of the country for more than a century. ...The end result is a fascinating, even indispensable look at one of America&#x2019;s essential historical components."<br><br><b><i>Kirkus Reviews<br></i></b>&#x201c;Wolmar, it seems, has no purpose other than crafting a critical but admiring study of a triumph of engineering, and in this he has succeeded. A solid and, yes, concise look at the railroad&#x2019;s past, with a rousing call at the end for a new and improved rail system to carry the nation forward.&#x201d;<br><br><i><b>BOOKLIST</b></i><b><i><br></i></b>&#x201c;Wolmar is clearly in love with his subject&#x2014;it&#x2019;s easy to imagine him as a sort of walking encyclopedia of railroad lore&#x2014;and his enthusiasm for his material shines through on every page. He finds the decline and increasing irrelevance of the railroad&#x2014;especially the passenger rails&#x2014;a deeply saddening aspect of contemporary life, and he makes a convincing case that, in losing rail travel as a fundamental human experience, we&#x2019;ve lost a hugely important part of ourselves and our history.&#x201d;<br><br><i><b>Australian Financial Review</b></i><br>&#x201c;Without the railroads, Wolmar contends, there would have been no United States. ...

Wolmar is so passionate about his subject that one cannot help but be swept along.

A rout of snails observe a group of queer, racially diverse humans gathered around a campfire. Iggy, a snail who belongs to one of the humans, takes a cue from their queer educator "dad" and schools the other snails on queerness, gender expression, dysphoria, asexuality, coming out, and even relationship basics. Iggy defines terms, offers helpful historical context, and dispels misconceptions. A discussion of the word queer follows the term's origins as an insult to its present-day reclamation as an umbrella term for LGBTQIA+ identities. The bubble gum palette matches perfectly the light, infectiously enthusiastic tone. The choice to use snails as narrators is whimsical and oddly appropriate (some snails are hermaphrodites). However, it also distances the human characters from readers. Those who do occasionally appear function almost as exhibits to add context to a point. Scenes involving fantastical creatures called Sproutlings feel random and unnecessary-but certainly on-brand. Though the book is slim, it effectively covers a broad swath of identities and topics. Activity pages and a resource guide are appended. VERDICT Accessible to readers at all levels of familiarity with LGBTQIA+ topics, this is a first purchase for libraries serving teens and adults.-Alec Chunn, Eugene Public Library, OR&#x3b1;(c) Copyright 2011.

Although it was a great place to grow up as a child, food was the least exciting thing about it. The generation of Jews who escaped Europe before the war, or came after, built this country on the idea that food was purely a means of survival. Unfortunately, my kibbutz was also founded by these same eastern Europeans, who left behind many of the culinary traditions of their native homes; all I can remember from my early days is boiled, flavorless dishes&#x2014;too often oversweetened or way too vinegary.<br><br>Luckily, we took trips to Kiryat Shmona, the nearest town, and Tel Aviv, where street food offered a variety of new flavors and ingredients. Keep in mind that until the early &#x2019;90s, the culinary scene in Israel, generally speaking, was as interesting as hummus in a can! The best meals were at home, and if you were lucky enough, you had a Moroccan or Persian friend who would invite you over for dinner.&nbsp;<br><br>There were also interesting culinary influences from our neighbors just over the Lebanese border, only a half mile away. We shopped and ate in areas that are now part of Palestine, and there were a few Druze villages just twenty minutes north where we could enjoy freshly made falafel, grilled meats, and sweets, as well as a delicious Arabic coffee spiced with cardamom. These cultures greatly impacted our meals at home, bringing new ingredients and dishes into our limited repertoire. Today, Israel has close to seventy different ethnic groups and, in turn, access to each of their uniquely authentic cuisines. We are finally seeing a culinary revolution that is as exciting as anywhere else on the planet. Israeli cuisine has certainly come a long way.<br><br>Growing up in the Galilee did have its advantages: we were surrounded by nature. The Dan River, which flows into the Jordan, brought schools of rainbow trout, which we&#x2019;d catch, stuff to the gills with wild herbs, and cook whole, simply, on the grill. Within reach were sprawling apple orchards, cornfields, and citrus groves. As kids we would venture out and fill up on everything we could pick ourselves, especially since we knew what was waiting for us back at the communal dining room for dinner.&nbsp;<br><br>Still, not every dish in the kibbutz was worth avoiding. One highlight from those days was the flatbreads my friends and I would bake in makeshift dirt ovens and eat with sour labneh cheese and fragrant za&#x2019;atar, a mix of sesame, sumac, thyme, and other herbs. Picking fresh thyme, oregano, or rosemary was a matter of going out into the garden or into the nearby fields where they grew wild. (To this day, I have a hard time paying for herbs packed in plastic clamshells at the supermarket.)<br><br>After we left the kibbutz, I started cooking because my mother worked late and my sisters and I needed to eat. It was that simple. She would leave ingredients and directions out on the counter, and we were on our own. Often the recipes would hail from one of my family&#x2019;s different cultures&#x2014;my mother&#x2019;s father was Tunisian and his wife was Transylvanian.&nbsp;<br><br>When I was seven, my father&#x2019;s work brought us to Belgium for four years, and we would venture to nearby Paris or Holland sometimes on the weekend. We all brought a little something back from that experience&#x2014;I&#x2019;m just glad my mother returned to Israel with a new love of cooking and the exposure to what we considered exotic ingredients at the time. Seafood, which was not readily available in Israel&#x2014;mussels and clams simply don&#x2019;t thrive in the Mediterranean Sea&#x2014;and pork were introduced to our dinner table. Even though kosher laws did not permit either, it was certainly a nice break from mashed chickpeas and tahini. (Was my family kosher? It depends who you ask.)<br><br>As teenagers my sisters and I had to work one day a week and half of our summer vacations at the kibbutz. For a while, I did my part by picking apples and avocados, but I mainly worked in our fish farms harvesting trout, carp, and tilapia. I think that my first spice blend was made on the banks of a large dirt fishpond. After a long day of harvesting fish, we started a small fire and cleaned a few tilapias. I remember grabbing some chile flakes, salt, paprika, garlic, and fresh za&#x2019;atar leaves from our cooler and coating the fish with this impromptu mixture before grilling them. This was to become our signature fish rub for the next few years.&nbsp;<br><br>When I turned nineteen, I became a sergeant in the Israeli Army to complete my mandatory military service. It was the first time I was officially in charge of a kitchen&#x2014; one of my many duties during that time. After my service ended, my older sister convinced me to do some traveling. I spent the next year venturing through South America, eagerly exploring every open-air market and bazaar I came across. Seeing endless mounds of chiles, merk�n spice (a blend of smoked pepper and coriander), and Chilean Chiloe&#x301; berry, none of which I had encountered before, sent me on a quest to learn about their origins and how they grew. I visited family-run farms in Peru and Ecuador to watch the chile harvests and ventured to Colombia to see firsthand how cardamom was grown.&nbsp;<br><br>Upon returning to Israel, I began seeing markets in an entirely new light. I loved the interaction with the vendors and the bargaining, particularly that Persian guy at Levinsky Spice Market in Tel Aviv. Each bag of spices at the market was a journey to a faraway place. Even now, I can&#x2019;t begin to count how many times I walked the threeblock-long spice market looking for a new treasure.<br><br>CULINARY SCHOOL &amp; OLIVIER ROELLINGER<br><br>My newfound passion for spices brought me to search for a job in a professional kitchen. But without any culinary school training, I couldn&#x2019;t even land a job as a dishwasher. After many attempts, I was lucky to meet chef Gil Frank, who owned the Menta catering company and who loved the fact that I hadn&#x2019;t been jaded by the culinary industry yet. He hired me as a sous chef and taught me some basic kitchen skills, and we spent three fantastic years working together. He encouraged me to attend culinary school, and I owe him a lot for having faith in me and for his support.<br><br>On his suggestion, I enrolled at the Institut Paul Bocuse in Lyon, France, where I would learn the techniques needed to make these ingredients come to life. During my first and second years, I had to do externships lasting six to seven months. When it was time for my second externship, one of the chefs at school who knew how fascinated I was with spices lent me a book by Olivier Roellinger. I knew nothing about him or his restaurant. I read that book twenty times in the next few days, and I couldn&#x2019;t understand how this worked: a French chef in Brittany was seasoning local ingredients with exotic spices from all over the world. I always thought the French were satisfied with salt, pepper, and a sprig of fresh thyme.<br><br>I immediately sent him an application letter. It came back denied, saying they did not accept interns. So I sent a second one. To my surprise, I was accepted. I arrived there on a spring afternoon and was greeted by Olivier&#x2019;s wife,&nbsp;Jane, who told me to place my things in the attic, where I would sleep, and to be downstairs for dinner service at five p.m. A few hours later, I found myself in a small kitchen surrounded by many types of fish, seafood, vegetables, and bags of turmeric, galangal, and curry leaves. Seeing these spices in a French kitchen was certainly a first; it took me a few days to understand what Chef Roellinger was doing.<br><br>I wanted to learn everything from him&#x2014;the history and trade routes, the larger story. But Olivier, the consummate mentor, pushed me to do my own research and develop my own style. I needed to connect with spices by creating my own path, not by simply following his. I didn&#x2019;t understand it at the time, but now, years later, I can only thank him for doing so.&nbsp;<br><br>When I moved back to Lyon, I worked in a small restaurant where, for the first time, I was able to create my own dishes and use spices as I saw fit.

Borneman gives us the first complete and authoritative biography of a president often overshadowed in image but seldom outdone in accomplishment. James K. Polk occupied the White House for only four years, from 1845 to 1849, but he plotted and attained a formidable agenda: He fought for and won tariff reductions, reestablished an independent Treasury, and, most notably, brought Texas into the Union, bluffed Great Britain out of the lion&#x2019;s share of Oregon, and wrested California and much of the Southwest from Mexico. On reflection, these successes seem even more impressive, given the contentious political environment of the time.<br><br>In this unprecedented, long-overdue warts-and-all look at Polk&#x2019;s life and career, we have a portrait of an expansionist president and decisive statesman who redefined the country he led, and we are reminded anew of the true meaning of presidential accomplishment and resolve.</p><p>Walter R. Borneman is the author of several books, including <b>Polk</b><i>, 1812: The War That Forged a Nation, The French and Indian War: Deciding the Fate of North America</i>, and <i>Alaska: Saga of a Bold Land</i>. He is the president of the Walter V. and Idun Y. Berry Foundation, which funds postdoctoral fellowships in children&#x2019;s health at Stanford University.Chapter 1<br> &nbsp;<br> Old Hickory&#x2019;s Boy<br> &nbsp;<br> JAMES K. POLK always had what any politician craves&#x2014;the unqualified support of his era&#x2019;s greatest hero. To be sure, some folks vilified the very name of Andrew Jackson. But they were usually in the minority, and from his fabled victory at New Orleans in 1815 until his death in 1845, Jackson cast a huge shadow across the American political landscape. Throughout most of that time, there was never much doubt that James K. Polk was Old Hickory&#x2019;s boy.<br> &nbsp;<br> It was no small coincidence that the men were born within twenty miles of each other in the frontier hills of the Carolinas. Jackson was the elder by twenty-eight years. Because Jackson&#x2019;s recently widowed mother was traveling to join family, there is some doubt which sister&#x2019;s home, and hence which side of the North Carolina&#x2013;South Carolina border, Elizabeth Jackson was at when her third son was born on March 15, 1767. But young Andrew grew up at his aunt Jane&#x2019;s on the South Carolina side and stayed there until he rode north to Salisbury, North Carolina, to study law seventeen years later.<br> &nbsp;<br> The law and a lust for adventure soon led Jackson west across the Great Smoky Mountains to Tennessee. In Jonesborough at the age of twenty-one, he fought his first duel, after taking the sarcasm of opposing counsel during a trial a little too personally. Both parties fired into the air, and Jackson left the field satisfied that his reputation was secure. Later in that same year of 1788, he arrived in Nashville.<br> &nbsp;<br> On the great Cumberland River, Nashville was still very much a fledgling frontier settlement, a town of a few hundred people that nonetheless had already managed to erect both a courthouse and a distillery. Jackson&#x2019;s boisterous personality attracted plenty of attention. In 1796, after helping to draft a state constitution, Andrew Jackson was elected Tennessee&#x2019;s first delegate to the U.S. House of Representatives. He was all of twenty-nine years old.<br> &nbsp;<br> By then, back in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, Samuel and Jane Polk had welcomed their firstborn. Jackson&#x2019;s Scots-Irish ancestors had barely reached America when Jackson was born, but the Polks were old-timers, Scots-Irish themselves. Sam&#x2019;s great-great-grandfather had arrived along the eastern shores of Chesapeake Bay in the late 1600s. The Polk clan soon migrated to south-central Pennsylvania and then to the Carolina hill country.<br> &nbsp;<br> Jane was a Knox, descended from a brother of Scottish Reformation leader John Knox. She was a no-nonsense Presbyterian, and she named the baby she delivered about noon on November 2, 1795, James Knox Polk after her father.<br> &nbsp;<br> Just about everyone else in Mecklenburg County was also Presbyterian, but there were various shades to their zeal. Sam Polk&#x2019;s father, Ezekiel, was a case in point. After the children he fathered with his second wife all died in infancy, Ezekiel became disillusioned with Presbyterian orthodoxy and began to espouse deism.<br> &nbsp;<br> When Sam and Jane presented Ezekiel&#x2019;s grandson to be baptized, a young &#x201c;fire and brimstone&#x201d; minister named James Wallis chose to interrogate Sam at length about the depths of his own commitment to Presbyterian doctrine. A heated argument ensued and the result was that little James Knox Polk was taken home without receiving the sacrament of baptism. Jane was mortified.<br> &nbsp;<br> Quite an uproar ensued throughout Mecklenburg County as Ezekiel voiced his views louder and louder and the Reverend Wallis preached back with equal passion. As if mortification weren&#x2019;t enough, Jane Polk was soon caught squarely in the middle of the debate when her widowed mother married none other than the Reverend Wallis&#x2019;s widower father. But by then, Ezekiel and most of the Polks were looking farther west.<br> &nbsp;<br> In 1803, Ezekiel Polk led four of his children and their families into the Duck River country of Middle Tennessee in search of new land. At first, Sam and Jane stayed behind in Mecklenburg with their son James and his two younger sisters and a brother. By the time another son was born and the crops of 1806 harvested, Sam and Jane had also left Mecklenburg and made the four-hundred-mile trek over the Smokies to Ezekiel&#x2019;s settlement south of Nashville. Ostensibly a farmer and part-time surveyor, Sam Polk quickly turned to land speculation.<br> &nbsp;<br> With half the area populated by kin, it wasn&#x2019;t long before the Polk clan was instrumental in establishing the county of Maury and the new town of Columbia as the county seat. Sam Polk was soon a county judge, a respected civic leader, and well on his way to becoming downright wealthy. One of the influential men of Tennessee to grace the Polk house from time to time was Andrew Jackson, by then an ex-judge of the state superior court and a well-established land speculator in his own right.<br> &nbsp;<br> Sam&#x2019;s son James, however, was not doing well. His schooling to date had been marginal, in large part because of his rather poor health. On a rough-and-tumble frontier where robust men like Andrew Jackson epitomized manhood, James was decidedly frail. In time, his chronic abdominal pains were diagnosed as urinary stones, but in this era before general anesthetic or even proper antiseptic agents, a surgical solution was a major undertaking.<br> &nbsp;<br> In the fall of 1812, Sam Polk determined to send his almost-seventeen-year-old son to Philadelphia to receive the care of Dr. Philip Syng Physick, later known as &#x201c;the father of American surgery.&#x201d; Resting uncomfortably on a makeshift bed in a covered wagon, James bounced along as the eight-hundred-mile journey from Columbia began.<br> &nbsp;<br> But before traveling very far into Kentucky, James &#x201c;was seized by a paroxysm more painful than any that had preceded it.&#x201d; Doubting that he could survive all the way to Philadelphia, the Polks turned instead to Dr. Ephraim McDowell of Danville, Kentucky, who&#x2014;relatively speaking&#x2014;was also a surgeon of some note.<br> &nbsp;<br> Relying on a liberal dose of brandy as both anesthetic and antisepsis, Dr. McDowell made an incision behind the young man&#x2019;s scrotum and forced a sharp, pointed instrument called a gorget through his prostate and into the bladder. The urinary stone, or stones, were then removed with forceps. Any way one looks at it, the procedure was a ghastly invasion of one&#x2019;s body. James recovered quickly, however, and outwardly appeared no worse for the wear.<br> &nbsp;<br> Relieved of this health burden, James made the most of his newfound energy. Sam Polk offered to set his son up in the mercantile business, but James was determined to get a proper education. In July 1813, James&#x2014;despite the fact that his principal biographer chose to call him &#x201c;Jimmy&#x201d; and &#x201c;Jim,&#x201d; there is no evidence that his elders and peers called him anything but James&#x2014;enrolled at a nearby Presbyterian academy.<br> &nbsp;<br> After a year, his father agreed to send him to a more distinguished academy in Murfreesboro. James excelled there and by one account was &#x201c;much the most promising young man in the school.&#x201d; Such promise was to be rewarded, and with Sam Polk by now well able to afford it, James was admitted to the University of North Carolina as a second-semester sophomore in January 1816. He had just turned twenty.<br> &nbsp;<br> At that time, the University of North Carolina was staffed by a single administrator, one professor, a senior tutor, and two recent graduates who served as additional tutors. The most valuable education may have come from membership in one of the university&#x2019;s two literary societies. James Polk joined the Dialectic Society during his first term at Chapel Hill and was soon engrossed in its weekly debates and essay presentations. It was here that he learned to speak, write, and formulate an argument.<br> &nbsp;<br> Unfortunately, no detailed minutes remain from the meeting at which the Dialectic Society debated the question &#x201c;Would an extension of territory be an advantage to the United States?&#x201d; Which side did young Polk take? A majority voted no. Another topic asked whether an elected representative should &#x201c;exercise his own judgment or act according to the directions of his constituents.&#x201d; Polk favored the latter, as did a majority of his classmates. A less serious question asked &#x201c;Is an occasional resort to female company beneficial to students?&#x201d; The all-male assemblage was unanimous in its verdict.<br> &nbsp;<br> In due course, Polk was elected to a succession of offices in the Dialectic Society and broke a precedent by winning reelection to the presidency. In presenting a speech on that occasion, Polk told his peers, &#x201c;your proficiency in extemporaneous debating will furnish you with that fluency of language, that connexion of ideas and boldness of delivery that will be equally serviceable in the council, in the pulpit and at the bar.&#x201d; Considering the large number of his University of North Carolina contemporaries who went on to public service, including his roommate William D. Moseley, who became governor of Florida, Polk&#x2019;s advice was well taken.<br> &nbsp;<br><br> &nbsp;</p><h2>The Kiss Thief</h2><p><p>They say your first kiss should be earned.<br> <br> Mine was stolen by a devil in a masquerade mask under the black Chicago sky.<br> <br> They say the vows you take on your wedding day are sacred.<br> <br> Mine were broken before we left church.<br> <br> They say your heart only beats for one man.<br> <br> Mine split and bled for two rivals who fought for it until the bitter end.<br> <br> I was promised to Angelo Bandini, the heir to one of the most powerful families in the Chicago Outfit.<br> <br> Then taken by Senator Wolfe Keaton, who held my father's sins over his head to force me into marriage. <br> <br> They say that all great love stories have a happy ending.<br> <br> I, Francesca Rossi, found myself erasing and rewriting mine until the very last chapter.<br> <br> One kiss.<br> Two men.<br> Three lives.<br> Entwined together.<br> <br> And somewhere between these two men, I had to find my forever.</p></p><p></p><h2>Remember Me?: Loving and Caring for a Dog with Canine Cognitive Dysfunction</h2><p><p><i>Remember Me?</i> is an award-winning guidebook for owners of dogs who are losing their mental faculties as they age, and the story of a dog and owner who retained their bond through this most difficult situation.</p> <p>If you have an aging dog, <i>Remember Me?</i> will give you the information you need to weather the difficult condition and give your dog the most fulfilling life possible.

It was canine cognitive dysfunction, or dog dementia, which is medical condition that goes far beyond the normal slowing down as dogs age. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>I don't want anyone else to delay going to the vet about this for more than a year as I did, or to feel alone with the strange symptoms that can sometimes occur. &nbsp;My hope is that my book raises awareness of age-related canine dementia and helps dogs and owners everywhere. &nbsp; --Eileen AndersonIs your older dog starting to get stuck in corners, stare at walls, or act a little distant? Is he pacing in circles, barking for no apparent reason, or forgetting his housetraining? These or other behavioral changes may indicate that he is developing canine cognitive dysfunction, a disease akin to Alzheimer's.<br>&nbsp;<br>Author Eileen Anderson, who demystifies dog behavior at the plainspoken and practical blog <i>Eileen and Dogs</i>, learned about this surprisingly common condition firsthand a few years ago, when her beloved rat terrier Cricket began acting frightened of a person she'd previously loved. As her dementia progressed, Cricket also began walking in circles, standing on the wrong side of doors, getting trapped under furniture, and losing and finding her owner repeatedly. In the last weeks of her life, she even forgot how to drink water. To help Cricket, Anderson put her methodical mind to work, and in this comprehensive and compassionate guide she shares everything she learned and more. <br>&nbsp;<br>You'll learn about the symptoms of canine cognitive dysfunction and the medications typically used to treat it, as well as other interventions that have shown promise in peer-reviewed studies. You'll learn how to arrange your home and adjust your habits to keep your dog safe,including what specific products may be helpful.

He first identified that diet promotes inflammation based on research published in the 1970s and 1980s. Most have only begun to see this relationship in recent years. In contrast, Dr Seaman has written multiple articles and chapters on this topic over the past 25 years. The DeFlame Diet is about eating anti-inflammatory foods to turn off the chronic disease-promoting &#34;flame&#34; created by pro-inflammatory foods. This is the first nutrition book for the general public that delves into inflammation in great detail, yet in a fashion that is understandable.

With her family, she pioneered throughout America&#x2019;s heartland during the 1870s and 1880s, finally settling in Dakota Territory. She married Almanzo Wilder in 1885; their only daughter, Rose, was born the following year. The Wilders moved to Rocky Ridge Farm at Mansfield, Missouri, in 1894, where they established a permanent home. After years of farming, Laura wrote the first of her beloved Little House books in 1932. The nine Little House books are international classics. Her writings live on into the twenty-first century as America&#x2019;s quintessential pioneer story.</p><br><br><p>Ren�e Graef received her bachelor's degree in art from the University of Wisconsin at Madison.

Neighbors didn&#x2019;t speak to each other anymore, and someone even hissed &#x201c;Tory!&#x201d; at her. All around Katie, men were arming themselves for war. Then one day it happened&#x2014;the rebels came! Katie&#x2019;s father told the family to hide in the woods. At first Katie obeyed, but as she crouched in the underbrush she got mad and ran back to defend her home. It wasn&#x2019;t right for people to treat one another this way. But what could one little girl do about it?</p><p>Ann Turner is an award-winning screenwriter and director, avid reader, and history lover.

An interest in American Indian culture first brought Mr. Himler to the southwest, and his work often features western subjects as well as historical themes. His paintings are frequently exhibited in galleries in the southwest. Ron Himler has illustrated more than seventy-five children&#x2019;s books.Grade 1-5-- As she did in Dakota Dugout (Macmillan, 1985), Turner creates a moment in history with evocative words and poetic images. Here she turns her attention to the period between the Boston Tea Party and the battles that began the American Revolution. Katie, the middle child in a family of Tory sympathizers, senses the impending conflict. When a group of armed neighbors come to their home with the intention of stealing and looting, the family takes refuge in the adjoining woods. The child impulsively dashes back to the house to protect their valuable possessions. When one of the young rebels disturbs her hiding place, he calls off his companions, keeping his discovery a secret. This story presents another side of a moral issue. There were good people loyal to England before and during the Revolution; students should hear their stories as well as those of the more famous and celebrated rebels. Himler's muted watercolor and pencil illustrations convey the mood of the calm before a storm. The details of costume and furnishings further reinforce the sense of place and time. However, the artist gives little attention to individualized facial characteristics, making it difficult to distinguish one person from another. The text and illustrations do blend harmoniously, and together tell a tale of courage, fortitude, and loyalty from the Tory point of view. With spare but eloquent prose, Turner has created a thoughtful picture of a family confronting difficult choices in unsettling times. --Martha Rosen, Edgewood School, Scarsdale, NY<br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said</h2><p>"Dick skillfully explores the psychological ramifications of this nightmare."&#x2014;<i>The New York Times Review of Books</i><br><br><i>Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said</i> grapples with many of the themes Philip K. Dick is best known for&#x2014; identity, altered reality, drug use, and dystopia&#x2014;in a rollicking chase story that earned the novel the John W. Campbell Award and nominations for the Hugo and Nebula.<br><br>Jason Taverner&#x2014;world-famous talk show host and man-about-town&#x2014;wakes up one day to find that no one knows who he is&#x2014;including the vast databases of the totalitarian government. And in a society where lack of identification is a crime, Taverner has no choice but to go on the run with a host of shady characters, including crooked cops and dealers of alien drugs. But do they know more than they are letting on? And just how can a person&#x2019;s identity be erased overnight?</p><p>&gt;On October 11 the television star Jason Taverner is so famous that 30 million viewers eagerly watch his prime-time show. On October 12 Jason Taverner is not a has-been but a never-was -- a man who has lost not only his audience but all proof of his existence. And in the claustrophobic betrayal state of Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said, loss of proof is synonyms with loss of life.<p>Taverner races to solve the riddle of his disappearance", immerses us in a horribly plausible Philip K. Dick United States in which everyone -- from a waiflike forger of identity cards to a surgically altered pleasure -- informs on everyone else, a world in which omniscient police have something to hide. His bleakly beautiful novel bores into the deepest bedrock self and plants a stick of dynamite at its center.</p><p>Over a writing career that spanned three decades, PHILIP K. DICK (1928&#x2013;1982) published 36 science fiction novels and 121 short stories in which he explored the essence of what makes man human and the dangers of centralized power. Toward the end of his life, his work turned toward deeply personal, metaphysical questions concerning the nature of God. Eleven novels and short stories have been adapted to film,&nbsp;notably&nbsp;<i>Blade Runner</i> (based on <i>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?</i>), <i>Total Recall,</i><i>Minority Report,</i> and <i>A Scanner Darkly. </i>The recipient of critical acclaim and numerous awards throughout his career, Dick was inducted into the&nbsp;Science Fiction&nbsp;Hall of Fame in 2005, and in 2007 the Library of America published a selection of his novels in three volumes. His work has been translated into&nbsp;more than twenty-five&nbsp;languages.</p></p><h2>Rise and Grind: Outperform, Outwork, and Outhustle Your Way to a More Successful and Rewarding Life</h2><p><b><b><i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>The Power of Broke </i>and "Shark" on ABC's hit show <i>Shark Tank</i> explores how grit, persistence, and good old-fashioned hard work are the backbone of every successful business and individual, and inspires readers to <i>Rise &amp; Grind</i> their way the top.</b></b><br><br>Daymond John knows what it means to push yourself hard--and he also knows how spectacularly a killer work ethic can pay off.

I get up&#x2014;�before the sun, some mornings&#x2014;�and start grinding at my goals, hard. I go to sleep&#x2014;�stupid-�late, most nights&#x2014;�still grinding. Because when I hear people say there isn&#x2019;t time enough in the day to do everything they need to do, it gets me hot, and not in a good way. Time enough? Yeah, I get that it sometimes feels like there aren&#x2019;t enough hours in the day, but the feeling only hits me when I&#x2019;m not using those hours wisely. When I&#x2019;m not efficient, organized, on it. But if I&#x2019;m on top of my game, in tireless pursuit, there&#x2019;s always time. And if it starts looking like the clock is about to run out on me, I&#x2019;ll work even harder.<br><br>I&#x2019;m burning the midnight oil.<br><br>The early bird catches the worm.<br><br>Early to bed and early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise.<br><br>You&#x2019;ve heard all the expressions&#x2014;�probably got a few of your own to get you up and at &#x2019;em in the morning. Here&#x2019;s one that inspired me, when I was just getting started: It&#x2019;s time to make the donuts. Do you remember that Dunkin&#x2019; Donuts ad campaign? That was like a rallying cry to me and my boys! If you ask me, they should still be using those ads, but now we&#x2019;re supposed to be &#x201c;runnin&#x2019; on Dunkin&#x2019;,&#x201d; so those days are gone. Still, I&#x2019;ve done some work with the company over the years, which seems fitting because it reaches all the way back to what got me up and runnin&#x2019; when I was a kid.<br><br>(Hey, bet you didn&#x2019;t know&#x2014;�those spots were named one of the five best commercial campaigns of the 1980s by the Television Bureau of Advertising, so obviously they made an impression on lots of people, not just on me.)<br><br>I&#x2019;ll tell you, when those time to make the donuts ads first hit, they got me thinking. I&#x2019;d see that guy with the mustache, Fred the Baker, getting up at some ridiculously early hour and shuffling off to the donut shop to start his day, and I got the message that hard work was hard work. That when a thing needs doing you&#x2019;ve got no choice but to get your butt out of bed and do it. It might seem obvious, but you have to realize, outside of my mother, there weren&#x2019;t too many positive examples of folks in my neighborhood rising and grinding in this way&#x2014;�getting up and getting things done when everyone else you know is dead asleep (that said, looking back, I realize it&#x2019;s not that no one in my neighborhood was rising and grinding&#x2014;�it&#x2019;s just that they were up early and off to do their thing, so I never saw them).<br><br>Point is, these days, when I stumble out of bed to catch a predawn flight to who knows where, and shuffle to the bathroom to brush my teeth and splash some water on my face, I&#x2019;ve still got that phrase bouncing around in my head . . . It&#x2019;s time to make the donuts.<br><br>Maybe there&#x2019;s some other phrase that gets you going, like this great line: The dream is free. The hustle is sold separately.<br><br>Or this quote I once heard from Jerry Rice, the legendary football player: Today I will do what others won&#x2019;t, so tomorrow I can accomplish what others can&#x2019;t.<br><br>Then there are these oldies but goodies:<br><br>A little hard work never killed anybody.<br><br>Hard work is the yeast that raises the dough.<br><br>No one ever drowned in sweat.<br><br>We&#x2019;ve given ourselves these little bumper-�sticker expressions, and we&#x2019;ve repeated them into the ground. And that&#x2019;s exactly where the trouble starts. See, these phrases have become clich�s, and the thing about clich�s is that we tend to race over them. We hear the words but not the truth they have to tell us. They become like background music. We forget why they caught on in the first place.<br><br>But it&#x2019;s not about the words, for me. The words, they&#x2019;ll only get you so far. It&#x2019;s about the action. It&#x2019;s about the goals you set for yourself and how you go after them. It&#x2019;s about the structure you lay out and your ability to stick to it. It&#x2019;s about whether you actually get up and make the donuts, or you just think about it. Doesn&#x2019;t matter what you say you&#x2019;ll do . . . doesn&#x2019;t matter what you mean to do . . . doesn&#x2019;t matter what you hope to do . . . None of that matters until you rise and grind and get to it.<br><br>Think Big<br><br>There&#x2019;s no cap on what you can accomplish.<br><br>If you can picture it, you can make it so.<br><br>Be the change you want in your life.<br><br>We hear these kinds of mantras from motivational gurus all the time. But they often leave out the most important part: if you&#x2019;re willing to put in the work.<br><br>I know this because I&#x2019;ve lived this. I know this because I grew up watching my mother find a way to work two or three jobs and still keep a close watch on me to make sure I didn&#x2019;t get into any trouble. Once I caught the reading bug a little later on in life, I was all over books like Who Moved My Cheese? and The One Minute Manager, but my mother&#x2019;s good influence found me in a more organic way. She was a daily inspiration to me, just by the way she carried herself. Her grind was the background music to my growing up. It was in the air and all around. I talk all the time about the ways she set the bar high for me&#x2014;�like when she hung up a giant can opener on the wall in our house, with a sign saying think big, to give me something to shoot for, to reach for each and every day. Those words were such a meaningful reminder to me I put up a think big sign of my own in the reception area at Blueprint + Co, the coworking space I opened up in midtown Manhattan for executives and entrepreneurs, so the change agents who shared our space would get a daily jolt of my mother&#x2019;s homespun advice.<br><br>Think big! There&#x2019;s no other way to think, if you ask me. Anything less than big, what&#x2019;s the point?<br><br>But my mother didn&#x2019;t just teach me to think big. She also taught me to reach big, to go big. One of the things she used to get on me about was whenever I&#x2019;d say I didn&#x2019;t want to take the time to put into this or that. I&#x2019;d throw up my hands and say something like, &#x201c;It&#x2019;ll take too much time.&#x201d; And she&#x2019;d just shake her head and say something like, &#x201c;Daymond, the time will pass anyway. Might as well use it productively.&#x201d;<br><br>Out of that, I came up with a line of my own: &#x201c;The time will never be perfect, so you can only make perfect use of your time.&#x201d;<br><br>(I&#x2019;m still using that one!)<br><br>You know, one of the positive habits I&#x2019;ve developed in this area has more to do with what I don&#x2019;t do than with what I do do, and it goes to making sure I have &#x201c;time enough&#x201d; for the big stuff. And what I don&#x2019;t do is watch a lot of television. That was never really my thing, although these days, with all these great, great shows like The Walking Dead and Game of Thrones that everyone seems to be binge-�watching left and right, it gets tougher and tougher to resist that temptation. I&#x2019;m made to feel like I&#x2019;m missing out, and I guess I am, but I&#x2019;ve got things to do, man. Nothing against all you folks who make the time to binge-�watch these shows, but it doesn&#x2019;t feel to me like I have all that time to sit in front of the television. Oh, I&#x2019;ll watch a nature show every once in a while, or a documentary. I&#x2019;ll keep up on the news and anything educational or business-�related. And, of course, I&#x2019;ll be sure to tune in to every new Shark Tank episode. But I try to avoid all these great story-�driven shows like Homeland or Empire. Why? Because they&#x2019;re just stories. Because you get caught up in them. Because they&#x2019;re addictive. Because there&#x2019;s a lot I have to get done, and as good as these shows are, they&#x2019;re not worth what I&#x2019;d have to give up.<br><br>So my thing is, I don&#x2019;t binge-�watch. I&#x2019;ll take the time to see a movie, but I can&#x2019;t get caught up in six or seven seasons of a show, and every time I&#x2019;m tempted to check out House of Cards or Orange Is the New Black or whatever, I think back to how things were with my mother, when it was just the two of us. When we just had our few local channels. I just can&#x2019;t imagine ever seeing my mother getting so hooked on some show that she would spend an entire weekend catching up on old episodes&#x2014;�would never have happened.<br><br>Her good example became mine: get up early, work hard, do what you have to do, don&#x2019;t complain, and do it all again the next day. The thing of it is, when I was a kid, my time wasn&#x2019;t totally my own. My grind had to happen outside of school. Those eight hours a day we were in class, they were off the table. I&#x2019;d get to school, go through the motions, and wait for the bell at the end of the day to tell me I could go off and do my thing. Later on, in high school, I started working in a co-�op program with First Boston in Manhattan, so I was able to get a jump on what the real world might look like for me, so that became a part of my grind. That became my hustle&#x2014;�and soon as I set my mind to making money and chasing my own dreams, I started working my sidelines like they were a full-�time deal. Like my life depended on it.<br><br>And, in a way, it did&#x2014;�but not just yet. The dreams, the hustle . . . they could only set me up for what was still to come.<br><br>Let&#x2019;s forget for the moment the extra grind that came my way because school was so hard for me. For those who don&#x2019;t know, I was dyslexic&#x2014;�I&#x2019;ve written about it, talked about it, worked to call attention to it as one of the biggest obstacles to success for way too many kids. (For some of us full-�grown kids, too!) In order for me to get by in school, I had to put in all this extra time just to keep up. Homework that took most kids an hour or two to complete took me four or five, so that just piled on even more time I had to slog my way past. But as a kid, all the way through high school, what choice did I have? I mean, it&#x2019;s not like there was some pill I could take, the way there might be these days, say, to help a kid deal with his or her ADD or ADHD. And because it was something you couldn&#x2019;t medicate, there wasn&#x2019;t a whole lot of information, not a whole lot of helpful resources, because there was no way for the medical establishment to make any kind of money off of it. I wasn&#x2019;t out there looking for a cure, wasn&#x2019;t looking to hide behind the fact that I had some trouble reading, studying. Wasn&#x2019;t looking for an escape. I was just looking for help. But you know what? If I could go back in time and take a magic pill, I wouldn&#x2019;t. Because to fix my dyslexia, to overcome it, I had to work twice as hard, and maybe that&#x2019;s another way I found my grind.<br><br>POWER FACT: Dyslexic entrepreneurs are more likely to launch multiple businesses, and to grow those businesses faster than nondyslexic entrepreneurs. . . . If you find yourself struggling with learning issues, know that you&#x2019;re in good company: Richard Branson, Charles Schwab, Henry Ford, David Boies, Ted Turner, Tommy Hilfiger, and yours truly are just a few successful CEOs who&#x2019;ve been diagnosed with dyslexia.<br><br>I wrote in my previous books about some of the tiny hustles I had going on back in the day. Fixing up old bicycles. Selling mirrors or pencils or whatever else to the other kids at school. Recycling broken toys. Shoveling snow. I had all these ways to make myself a little money so I could maybe go to the movies, buy myself a slice of pizza and a Coke . . . whatever. I don&#x2019;t want to suggest we were dead broke, me and my mother. Wasn&#x2019;t like that. We had a decent house, lived in a decent neighborhood&#x2014;�that is, until crack came along. Still, if I wanted a little extra walking-�around money, maybe buy myself a new pair of kicks . . . that was on me.<br><br>I came to realize very early on that each one of my enterprises would live or die by the time I put into it. And so, when I was in the bike business, for example, that meant getting out the door early on Saturday morning before the garbage pickup and harvesting parts from the beat-�up bicycles folks would leave for trash on the curb. It meant figuring out the best times to go dumpster-�diving out behind the mirror factory for those little handheld mirrors, then finding time to hit up the Ideal toy store, where they used to throw away all the busted-�up stuff the people would return. The bottom line was I needed to get a jump-�start, stake out my territory, and do my thing in a hurry to make sure nobody else could beat me out of a deal.<br><br>Time is money&#x2014;�that&#x2019;s another clich� you hear all the time in business. You hear it from young wannabe entrepreneurs, all the way up to the titans of industry, in the upper reaches of the one-�percent class. First time I heard it, I owned it. Figured it out for myself, really. Came to me on one of my very first gigs, shoveling snow. In my neighborhood, you had to get out the door pretty damn early to make some paper shoveling snow. If you slept in, or dug out your own driveway first, or stopped to eat a good breakfast, your day was over before it ever started&#x2014;�because, let&#x2019;s face it, the kiss of death in the snow removal industry, when everyone with a shovel and a strong back is working the same route, chasing the same business, is a late start.</p><h2>Fifty Places to Ski and Snowboard Before You Die: Downhill Experts Share the World&#39;s Greatest Destinations</h2><p><i>Fifty Places to Ski and Snowboard Before You Die&#x2015;</i>the 10th book in the popular Fifty Places series&#x2015;takes readers to some of the world&#x2019;s most inspiring skiing/snowboarding destinations: the Chugach Mountains (Alaska); Aspen, Crested Butte, and Steamboat Springs (Colorado); Tuckerman Ravine (New Hampshire); Rusutsu (Japan); Chamonix (France); Portillo (Chile); and Whistler Blackcomb (British Columbia).

A basic premise of <em>The Highly Engaged Classroom</em> is that student engagement happens as a result of a teacher s careful planning and execution of specific strategies. In other words, student engagement is not serendipitous. <br><br>This book was designed as a self-study text that provides an in-depth understanding of how to generate high levels of attention and engagement. Engagement is obviously a central aspect of effective teaching. Using the suggestions presented in this book, every teacher can create a classroom environment in which engagement is the norm instead of the exception. <br><br>Part of the Classroom Strategies That Work library, this clear, highly practical guide follows the series format, first summarizing key research and then translating it into recommendations for classroom practice. In addition to the explanations and examples of engagement strategies, each chapter includes helpful exercises to reinforce the reader's understanding of the content. <br><br>Because research and theory can provide only a general direction for classroom practice, <em>The Highly Engaged Classroom</em> (and each book in the series) goes one step further to translate that research into applications for the classroom. Specifically, it addresses four emblematic questions students ask themselves, the answers to which determine how involved students are in classroom activities: How do I feel?, Am I interested?, Is this important?, and Can I do this? For each of these four emblematic questions, specific classroom strategies are provided in chapters 2 through 5.</p><p>Robert J.

But as the family sits around their scratched-up kitchen table and discusses the subject, her parents say they&#x2019;re <i>rich</i>. Don&#x2019;t her parents see her worn-out shoes or the patches on her little brother&#x2019;s pants?<br> <br>They begin to count up the value of the things they have. How much is it worth to be able to see the sky all day and feel the wind and smell the coming rain? Or to watch a cactus bloom or to sleep outside under the stars? After a while, Mountain Girl begins to realize money may not be as important as she thought. Could her family really be rich after all?</p><p>Byrd Baylor lives and writes in Arizona, presenting images of the Southwest and an intense connection between the land and the people. Her prose illustrates vividly the value of simplicity, the natural world, and the balance of life within it.Money. Always a problem. A young girl feels her family is too poor, and she calls a family meeting to discuss the question of money. But by giving another definition of rich, her folks set her straight: They are indeed rich in ways immeasurable by the dollar (although they assign monetary values to their pleasures for the purposes of the meeting). The family members lead lives of great deliberation, being where they want to be, doing what they choose to do. Sunrise, ocean waves, the smell of rain, mountain shadows, bird calls--these all add up (to $60,000, to be precise). And, of course, they have each other, which is worth $4,000,000 more. The final tally, without even including what they actually earn, comes to $4,060,000. So they are rich. Baylor's (Your Own Best Secret Place, 1991, etc.) story can be clumsy, even ham-handed, but the message is immediate. More problematic are the illustrations: Peter Max-like psychedelia meets Outdoor Life in a fusion that crashes and burns. (Fiction/Picture book. 7-10) -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Drucker analyzed economics and society for more than sixty years. Now for readers everywhere who are concerned with the ways that management practices and principles affect the performance of organizations, individuals, and society, there is <em>The Essential Drucker</em>&#x2014;an invaluable compilation of essential materials from the works of a management legend. </p><p>Containing twenty-six core selections, <em>The Essential Drucker</em> covers the basic principles and concerns of management and its problems, challenges, and opportunities, giving managers, executives, and professionals the tools to perform the tasks that the economy and society of tomorrow will demand of them. </p></p><p>Ever since his first book was published some six decades ago, Peter Drucker has been essential to everyone serious about the "management of an enterprise (and) the self-management of the individual, whether executive or professional, within an enterprise and altogether in our society of managed organizations." This distinguished 30-year Claremont University professor has continuously identified critical principles in management, economics, politics, and the world in general. And he has redirected our thinking about them through more than two dozen books, including an autobiography and a couple of works of fiction. Now, with <i>The Essential Drucker</i>, he has overseen the compilation of his most important fundamentals into one indispensable book. <p> Reaching back as far as 1954 with his treatise "Management by Objectives and Self-Control" ("Each manager, from the 'big boss' down to the production foreman or the chief clerk, needs clearly spelled-out objectives" that clarify expected contributions "to the attainment of company goals in all areas of the business"), Drucker's now-established ideas take on a surprising new relevancy when remixed equally pioneering ideas from the 1960s, '70s, '80s, and '90s. Between the thoughtful "Management as Social and Liberal Art" through the provocative "From Analysis to Perception--The New Worldview" (both originally published in 1988's <i>The New Realities</i>), this book revisits some of modern management's most inspired writing and presents it in a way that should appeal to both newcomers and those needing a refresher course on Drucker's basic beliefs. --<i>Howard Rothman</i></p><p>Peter F. Drucker is considered the most influential management thinker ever. The author of more than twenty-five books, his ideas have had an enormous impact on shaping the modern corporation. Drucker passed away in 2005. </p></p><h2>The Food of Morocco</h2><p><p><strong>Winner of the James Beard Foundation's Lifetime Achievement Award</strong></p><p>&#x201c;A cookbook by Paula Wolfert is cause for celebration.

But by the time Raylan finds out who's making the cuts, he's lying naked in a bathtub, with Layla, the cool transplant nurse, about to go for his kidneys.</p><p>Elmore Leonard wrote more than forty books during his long career, including the bestsellers <em>Raylan</em>, <em>Tishomingo Blues</em>, <em>Be Cool</em>, <em>Get Shorty</em>, and <em>Rum Punch</em>, as well as the acclaimed collection <em>When the Women Come Out to Dance</em>, which was a <em>New York Times</em> Notable Book.

Making better decisions means living a better life. But how can we develop the habit of making great decisions? <br><br> Every noteworthy achievement the world has ever seen was born with a single thought; and every great man who ever lived has been a man of decision. Raymond Charles Barker's <i>The Power of Decision</i> reveals this principle of success and illustrates the process of choice that all of us must take-and that all of us are capable, this very second, of taking-to change our lives and make our dreams come true. <br><br> Indecisive people are failure prone, and Dr. Barker examines this basic truth while exploring the decision-making process in the individual, and the role of the subconscious mind in either abetting or thwarting each of our conscious decisions. He provides specific steps to shift the balance of decision-making power in your favor, and he brings to light the constant, ever-present power of will to change a situation- and yourself-for the better. <br><br> Picking up <i>The Power of Decision</i> is the moment; and reading it is the decision that will change your life forever.</p><p>Raymond Charles Barker (1911 &#x2013; 1988) opened the First Church of Religious Science in New York City in 1946, was President of the International New Thought Alliance (INTA) and was a well-known minister, teacher and author.

Unsettling and indelible, <i>Of Love and Other Demons</i> is an evocative, majestic tale of the most universal experiences known to woman and man.</p><p>From the Nobel Prize-winning author of Love in the Time of Cholera, a startling new novel -- the story of a doomed love affair between an unruly copper-haired girl and the bookish priest sent to oversee her exorcism.<br><br>Of Love and Other Demons is set in a South American seaport in the colonial era, a time of viceroys and bishops, enlightened men and Inquisitors, saints and lepers and pirates. Sierva Maria, only child of a decaying noble family, has been raised in the slaves' courtyard of her father's cobwebbed mansion while her mother succumbs to fermented honey and cacao on a faraway plantation. On her twelfth birthday the girl is bitten by a rabid dog, and even as the wound is healing she is made to endure therapies indistinguishable from tortures. Believed, finally, to be possessed, she is brought to a convent for observation.

While intersectionality helps shed light on contemporary social issues, Collins notes that it has yet to reach its full potential as a critical social theory. She contends that for intersectionality to fully realize its power, its practitioners must critically reflect on its assumptions, epistemologies, and methods. She places intersectionality in dialog with several theoretical traditions&#x2014;from the Frankfurt school to black feminist thought&#x2014;to sharpen its definition and foreground its singular critical purchase, thereby providing a capacious interrogation into intersectionality's potential to reshape the world.</p><p>Patricia Hill Collins is Distinguished University Professor Emerita of Sociology at the University of Maryland, College Park, and the author of numerous books, most recently, <i>Intersectionality</i> (with Sirma Bilge) and <i>On Intellectual Activism</i>.&#x201c;With remarkable brilliance and breadth, Patricia Hill Collins examines the theoretical dimensions of intersectionality in new ways and in dialogue with other influential social theories and resistant knowledges. <i>Intersectionality as Critical Social Theory</i> explains why critical social theory matters in the real world and how intersectionality can achieve its potential as a tool for social action needed to transform the world for the better. Once again, Patricia Hill Collins shines as a masterful scholar of critical inquiry, politics, and social change.&#x201d; (Dorothy Roberts, author of <i>Killing the Black Body: Race, Reproduction, and the Meaning of Liberty</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Anyone who claims the mantle of Black feminist theorist is standing in the house Patricia Hill Collins built. She is one of our most important intellectual architects. Here she continues to be at her very best, asking the thorny questions that those of us who are scholars and practitioners of intersectionality often avoid. Collins reminds us what it looks like to use ideas in service of freedom projects, demanding at every turn that we do it with integrity, rigor, and a critical attention to the high stakes nature of social justice work. This book resets our freedom compass, reminding us both of what our work is and for whom we do it.&#x201d; (Brittney Cooper, author of <i>Eloquent Rage: A Black Feminist Discovers Her Superpower</i>)</p><h2>Adventures in Prayer: How to Reach for God&#39;s Helping Hand</h2><p>Catherine Marshall shares her personal discoveries about how surprisingly down-to-earth God wants our prayers to be.

Through this economy of language, Ewing &#x2014; who also co-penned a play about poet Gwendolyn Brooks and writes a Marvel comic series &#x2014; invites readers into a conversation.&#x201d;<br><strong><em>&#x2014;Chicago Tribune</em><br><br></strong>&#x201c;These clarion and haunting poems&#x2014;some psalm-like, others percussive, even concussive, all technically brilliant and sure to galvanize adults and teens alike&#x2014;incisively and resoundingly evoke the promise and betrayal of the Great Migration and the everyday struggles of Chicago&#x2019;s Black community against vicious and violent racism. The riot a century ago, Ewing writes, &#x2018;left an indelible mark on the city,&#x2019; which she gracefully, imaginatively, and searingly illuminates with hope for a more just future.&#x201d;<br><strong><em>&#x2014;Booklist</em> Starred Review<br><br></strong>&#x201c;The poems in <em>1919</em> ask how far we&#x2019;ve come, and question ideas of progress and of thriving and surviving. On the centenary of the Red Summer, in an America hardly less violent and anti-black, Ewing wields a kaleidoscopic Afrofuturist style to illuminate a crucial piece of history and to imagine a path forward.&#x201d;<br><strong><em>&#x2014;LitHub<br><br></em></strong>&#x201c;Ewing blends past, present, and future, imagining the stories of those who lived through the riot and beyond, and inquiring into its lasting consequences.&#x201d;<br><strong>&#x2014;<em>Buzzfeed<br><br></em></strong>&#x201c;Flecked with historical photos and evocative quotes from a post-riot commission report, filled with biblical and mythological references, seamlessly bending time and genre,&nbsp;<em>1919</em>&nbsp;is an unforgettable conversation-starter.

Exodus and deliverance to a promised land? The eternal return of racist violence? Time lends haunted hope. Maybe circular time, the eternal return, could cease and turn linear, toward exodus and deliverance. 1919 places readers in the minds and bodies of Black Chicagoans, Black Americans, and asks readers to see what has been, and what could be.&#x201d;<br><strong>&#x2014;<em>Vice</em></strong><br><strong><em><br> </em></strong>&#x201c;These poems are crafted and tense, inventive and full of energy.&#x201d;<br><strong>&#x2014;<em>The Rumpus<br><br></em></strong>&#x201c;Through personal creation, historical research, cultural connection, and an uncanny natural rhythm of time folding in on itself, Ewing manages to capture the people&#x2019;s stories and the devastating race riots with a fluid touch of hope, excitement, understanding, and an abiding sense of grief.&#x201d;<em><br></em><strong>&#x2014;<em>Third Coast Review<br></em></strong><strong><em><br></em></strong>&#x201c;We can&#x2019;t recommend this book highly enough.&#x201d;<br><strong>&#x2014;Zinn Education Project<em><br><br></em></strong>&#x201c;Equal parts poetry collection and sweeping historical narrative, <em>1919</em> has the feel of an instant classic.&#x201d;<br><strong>&#x2014;Danny Caine, Raven Bookstore<em><br></em></strong></p></p><h2>Resident Aliens: Life in the Christian Colony (Expanded 25th Anniversary Edition)</h2><p><p>Only when the Church enacts its scandalous Jesus-centered tradition will it truly be the body of Christ and transform the world. Twenty-five years after its first appearance, <em>Resident Aliens</em> remains a prophetic vision of how the Church can regain its vitality, battle its malaise, reclaim its capacity to nourish souls, and stand firmly against the illusions, pretensions, and eroding values of today's world. </p> <p><em>Resident Aliens</em> discusses the nature of the church and its relationship to surrounding culture. It argues that churches should focus on developing Christian life and community rather than attempting to reform secular culture. Stanley Hauerwas and William H. Willimon reject the idea that America is a Christian nation; instead, Christians should see themselves as "resident aliens" in a foreign land. According to Hauerwas and Willimon,&nbsp;the role of Christians is not to&nbsp;transform government but to&nbsp;live lives that model the love of Christ. Rather than try to convince others to change their ethics, Christians should model a new set of ethics that are grounded in the life, death, and resurrection of Christ.</p></p><p>Stanley Hauerwas is the Gilbert T. Rowe Professor Emeritus of Divinity and Law at the&nbsp;Divinity School at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina.&nbsp;He has written a voluminous number of articles, authored and edited many books, and has been the subject of other theologians' writing and interest. He has been a board member of the Society of Christian Ethics, Associate Editor of a number of Christian journals and periodicals, and a&nbsp;frequent lecturer at campuses across the country.<br><br>Feeling most at home behind a pulpit, Will Willimon&#x2019;s deepest calling is to be a preacher and truth-teller of Jesus Christ. He is Professor of the Practice of Christian Ministry at Duke University Divinity School and retired Bishop of the North Alabama Conference of The United Methodist Church, after serving for 20 years as faculty member and Dean of the Chapel at Duke University. He lives in Durham, North Carolina.<br><br>Will Willimon has published many books, including his preaching subscription service on MinistryMatters.com, Pulpit Resource, and Fear of the Other: No Fear in Love, both published by Abingdon Press.<br></p><h2>Say You Still Love Me: A Novel</h2><p><b>INTERNATIONAL BESTSELLER</b><br> <br><b>The bestselling author of <i>The Simple Wild </i>and <i>Keep Her Safe </i>and </b><b>&#x201c;master of steamy romance&#x201d; (<i>Kirkus Reviews</i>) delivers a sizzling novel about an ambitious and high-powered executive who reconnects with her first love: the boy who broke her heart. </b><br><br>Life is a mixed bag for Piper Calloway.<br> <br>On the one hand, she&#x2019;s a twenty-nine-year-old VP at her dad&#x2019;s multibillion-dollar real estate development firm, and living the high single life with her two best friends in a swanky downtown penthouse.

These difficulties also interfere with their ability to use self-help books and to get the most out of psychosocial treatments that provide coping strategies that promise to improve their functioning. Drs. Ramsay and Rostain are experts in the assessment and treatment of adult ADHD and are leaders in the development of effective psychosocial treatments for this group of patients.

The authors discuss many different settings in which ADHD may cause difficulties, including work, school, matters of physical health and well-being, and the issue of excessive use of technology. Although written for consumers, clinicians will find the book to be a clinically useful tool for their adult patients with ADHD, serving as a companion to the newly updated and expanded second edition of Drs.

Franklin Frazier&#x2019;s <i>Black Bourgeoisie</i> was simultaneously reviled and revered&#x2014;revered for its skillful dissection of one of America&#x2019;s most complex communities, reviled for daring to cast a critical eye on a section of black society that had achieved the trappings of the white, bourgeois ideal.<br> <br>The author traces the evolution of this enigmatic class from the segregated South to the post-war boom in the integrated North, showing how, along the road to what seemed like prosperity and progress, middle-class blacks actually lost their roots to the traditional black world while never achieving acknowledgment from the white sector. The result, concluded Frazier, is an anomalous bourgeois class with no identity, built on self-sustaining myths of black business and society, silently undermined by a collective, debilitating inferiority complex.</p><p>E.

Perhaps a third of the articles I wrote could have begun with an identical opener: &#x201c;On Tuesday, the city council voted to . . .&#x201d; But they didn&#x2019;t. The reason: the almighty Reader. <br>&nbsp;<br>In any type of writing, be it journalism, fiction, or advertising copy, the almighty Reader is the boss. But there&#x2019;s no better field for understanding this than community news. When I worked in that field, the Reader was always in my face. He wasn&#x2019;t like the silent, invisible, fickle master consuming literary fiction, corporate earnings reports, or sales brochures. The community news Reader wrote to me. He called me. And, because I was working in a much smaller arena than that of big-city reporters, he knew me. The Reader considered me part of the community, even though I lived fifty miles away, and he expected me to serve the town&#x2019;s best interests while answering to him directly. <br>&nbsp;<br>Yes, this got annoying at times. Especially when he failed to realize that he didn&#x2019;t get to assign me stories: &#x201c;I want you to do an expos� on how the president of my condo association refuses to put up &#x2018;Keep Off the Grass&#x2019; signs.&#x201d; In community news, the Reader will not be ignored.<br>&nbsp;<br>Now that I no longer wake up in the middle of the night screaming, &#x201c;I will not write a front-page article about your dog!&#x201d; I realize this experience is a good thing. It helped me understand how to form sentences that serve the Reader.<br>&nbsp;<br>Consider this story lead:<br>&nbsp;<br><i>The city council on Tuesday voted on a budget that contains no funds for fixing Main Street potholes.</i><br>&nbsp;<br>Informative, relevant, clear, true. But could the writer do a better job of remembering her boss, the Reader? Absolutely. A sentence like the one just stated is written from a writer&#x2019;s perspective. The writer&#x2019;s job consisted of going to a meeting, documenting a vote, and perhaps listening to some discussion of one important element of that vote&#x2014;pothole repair. So that&#x2019;s what got emphasized in the sentence.<br>&nbsp;<br>But this approach downplays the facts that are most pertinent to the Reader. Look at the main subject and action of the sentence: <i>The city council voted</i>. The Reader already knows that the council voted. The council is always voting. It votes on thirty, forty, fifty things a month&#x2014;most of which are total yawners. The Reader doesn&#x2019;t really care that the council voted. He cares about what it all means to him.<br>&nbsp;<br>These are the questions that a skilled newswriter asks: &#x201c;How will this affect the Reader? Why should he care?&#x201d; Such questions lead to an opener like this:<br>&nbsp;<br><i>The bumpy ride on Main Street isn&#x2019;t going to get smoother anytime soon.<br></i>&nbsp;<br>Although this example works well, we&#x2019;ve all seen this go too far. Used dishonorably, this approach can come off as pandering or even downright sleazy. Nonprint media come to mind: &#x201c;Something in your kitchen wants to kill your children! Details at eleven.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>But if you stop and think about such sleazy tactics, you see that this lead really has the same problem as the snoozer lead: It&#x2019;s writer-serving writing as opposed to Reader-serving or Viewer-serving writing. It&#x2019;s deliberate manipulation, and Viewers can smell it a mile away. It works&#x2014;but the best writing doesn&#x2019;t stoop to this level.<br>&nbsp;<br>To strike a balance between snoozer &#x201c;the city council voted&#x201d; sentences and sleazy &#x201c;there&#x2019;s a killer in your kitchen&#x201d; sentences, all you have to do is remember the Reader. Ask, &#x201c;What&#x2019;s important to my Reader?&#x201d; not just, &#x201c;What will get his attention?&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>The answer&#x2014;be it about the bumpy ride on Main Street or the bottom line on a tax bill&#x2014;then becomes the main point of your sentence, and your sentence can become a thing of real value. <br>&nbsp;<br>Of course, it&#x2019;s not always that simple. Wanting to accommodate your Reader and actually pulling it off are two different things. Ironically, sometimes the very act of trying to explain things to the Reader creates problems. Consider this sentence, written by a professional writer, which was in a piece I copyedited. I&#x2019;ve disguised it slightly to save the writer embarrassment:<br>&nbsp;<br><i>While the boat show is predictably crowded over the weekends, holding the event over Thanksgiving for the second consecutive year positively impacts the flow of attendees over the closing weekend, which is traditionally the busiest. <br></i>&nbsp;<br>Any copy editor who works with novice writers sees stuff like this all the time. This sentence, while not the worst ever, contains a number of problems that are all rooted in the writer&#x2019;s misguided attempts to explain stuff to the Reader. Let&#x2019;s look at it piece by piece:<br>&nbsp;<br><i>While the boat show<br></i>&nbsp;<br><i>While</i> is a subordinating conjunction, which we&#x2019;ll talk about in chapter 2. There&#x2019;s nothing wrong with starting a sentence with a subordinating conjunction in general or with <i>while</i> in particular. But such an opening can, in unskilled hands, pave the way for a problematic sentence. At the very least, it tells the Reader, &#x201c;Stay put. It could be a while before I get to the point.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br><i>is predictably crowded</i><br>&nbsp;<br>Really? It&#x2019;s <i>predictably crowded</i>? We can see what the writer meant: the show is so consistently crowded on the weekends that you could predict it. But does <i>predictably crowded</i> really capture this? The adverb <i>predictably</i> comes right before the adjective <i>crowded</i>, as if it&#x2019;s modifying <i>crowded</i>, as if it means that <i>predictably</i> is a way&#x2014;a manner&#x2014;of being crowded. As you&#x2019;ll see in chapter 7, adverbs are flexible. They&#x2019;re so flexible, in fact, that they can modify whole sentences. You could argue, then, that this part of our sentence is okay. But is it good? No.<br>&nbsp;<br><i>over the weekends<br></i>&nbsp;<br>Nothing wrong with that&#x2014;yet. But two more <i>over</i> phrases are about to appear in this sentence, so <i>over the weekends</i> sets up an annoying redundancy. We&#x2019;ll look at this type of problem more in chapter 9 when we discuss prepositional phrases.<br>&nbsp;<br><i>holding the event over Thanksgiving for the second consecutive year positively impacts the flow of attendees</i><br>&nbsp;<br>Most of the choices reflected in this clause might be fine in certain cases. But the overall effect stinks. For starters, this is the main clause of our sentence. That means it contains our main subject and our main verb. (We&#x2019;ll look at clause structure in chapter 3.) But both are downright anemic. <i>Holding</i>&#x2014;the subject of our lengthy, winding sentence&#x2014;is a form of a word that usually connotes action: <i>I hold, you hold, he holds</i>. But here it&#x2019;s made into something called a gerund, which is basically a noun. We&#x2019;ll talk more about actions made into nouns in chapter 13. The usage is grammatical, but is it wise to make this the main subject? Do you really want the single most important actor in your whole sentence to be the abstract concept of <i>holding</i>? <br>&nbsp;<br>Here&#x2019;s a more troubling part of that excerpt: <br>&nbsp;<br><i>for the second consecutive year</i><br>&nbsp;<br>The way this phrase modifies <i>holding</i> makes the sentence illogical. Let me pare down the sentence to show you what I mean: <i>Holding the event for the second consecutive year positively impacts the flow</i>. See how <i>for the second consecutive year</i> attaches itself to <i>holding</i>? We&#x2019;re no longer talking about just holding. We&#x2019;re talking specifically about the second time you do it. So our sentence says that the benefits of holding the boat show over Thanksgiving weekend apply only the second year. In years three, four, and five, holding it over Thanksgiving weekend has no effect. Only holding it for the second consecutive year impacts the flow. That&#x2019;s just wrong.<br>&nbsp;<br><i>positively impacts the flow of attendees</i><br>&nbsp;<br><i>Positively impacts</i> sounds like something in a corporate earnings report, and <i>flow of attendees</i> sounds like something in a fire safety manual. Each of these phrases squanders an opportunity to connect with the Reader in a more meaningful and tangible way. The Reader knows all about long ticket lines, bottlenecked foot traffic, and crowds in stadiums. He has visual and emotional associations with the concept of crowd control. There are so many ways to make the concept more meaningful than <i>positively impacts the flow of attendees</i>.<br>&nbsp;<br><i>Impacts</i>, all by itself, is a problem. It couldn&#x2019;t be vaguer. Here it&#x2019;s used to mean that something improves or reduces or ameliorates crowding. But <i>impacts</i> contains less information than any of these alternatives. Also, why use a word that could mean something negative <i>or</i> positive when you&#x2019;re clearly talking about something positive? (We&#x2019;ll discuss choosing specific words in chapter 6.) Making matters worse, some people argue that <i>impact</i> isn&#x2019;t really a verb. They&#x2019;re wrong. But since you&#x2019;ll never get a chance to sit down and explain that to them, you have to decide whether it&#x2019;s worth irking them.<br>&nbsp;<br>Oh, and don&#x2019;t miss that second <i>over</i> phrase, <br>&nbsp;<br><i>over Thanksgiving <br></i>&nbsp;<br>because here comes our third <i>over</i> phrase: <br>&nbsp;<br><i>over the closing weekend</i><br>&nbsp;<br>So we now have in one sentence <i>over the weekends</i>, <i>over Thanksgiving</i>, and <i>over the closing weekend</i>. Personally, I&#x2019;m amazed that the writer did such a good job of associating each time element with a specific action. Usually when you see this many time elements in a sentence you end up with a nonsensical statement like <i>He took a three-year hiatus in 1992</i> or <i>over the weekend he got lost over the course of three hours</i>. The three <i>over</i> phrases in one sentence tell us that the writer was simply cramming in too much information. Then, as if that weren&#x2019;t enough, one last thought gets tacked on:<br>&nbsp;<br><i>which is traditionally the busiest.<br></i>&nbsp;<br>This is called a relative clause (which we&#x2019;ll discuss in chapter 8). Relative clauses can be great for squeezing in more information&#x2014;when the information fits. But the usage here is like squeezing Louie Anderson into Ryan Seacrest&#x2019;s jogging shorts. Not pretty. <br>&nbsp;<br>Just look at all the distinct pieces of information we have in this sentence:<br>&nbsp;<br><i>The boat show is crowded on the weekends.<br>&nbsp;<br>This crowding is predictable.<br>&nbsp;<br>The event is being held [or can be held] over Thanksgiving.<br>&nbsp;<br>The event was held over Thanksgiving last year.<br>&nbsp;<br>Holding it over Thanksgiving means crowds are better spread out over the duration of the show. <br>&nbsp;<br>This improves crowding on the closing weekend.<br>&nbsp;<br>The closing weekend is traditionally the busiest.</i> <br>&nbsp;<br>We can understand why the writer didn&#x2019;t want to spend too much time on each of those points. But his attempt to slip them in gracefully failed because he was overambitious. He crammed in too much. The best thing you can do in a situation like this is to first consider whether any information can go (I, for one, can do without that <i>predictably</i> business) and to then break up what&#x2019;s left into smaller sentences. The possibilities are endless:<br>&nbsp;<br><i>The boat show gets crowded on the weekends. So this year, for the second time, it will conclude over the four-day Thanksgiving weekend. This spreads out the number of visitors and relieves crowding during the closing weekend, which is traditionally the busiest.</i><br>&nbsp;<br>or<br>&nbsp;<br><i>Saturdays and Sundays usually mean huge crowds at the boat show. The closing weekend gets especially jammed. But last year the producers had an idea: why not make the last weekend of the event the four-day Thanksgiving weekend? The strategy was so successful at reducing overcrowding that they&#x2019;re doing it again this year.</i><br>&nbsp;<br>I could go on. But you get the idea. <br>&nbsp;<br>As a writer, it&#x2019;s your job to organize information, to prioritize it with the Reader in mind, to chop and add as you see fit. But only by fully understanding the mechanics of the sentence can you do so in the best possible way.</p><h2>Salvation: A Novel (The Salvation Sequence)</h2><p><b>Humanity&#x2019;s complex relationship with technology spirals out of control in this first book of an all-new series from &#x201c;the owner of the most powerful imagination in science fiction&#x201d; (Ken Follett).</b><br><b><br>&#x201c;How far &#x2018;space opera&#x2019; has come!&nbsp;The Old Masters of sci-fi would admire the scope and sweep of&nbsp;<i>Salvation</i>.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>The Wall Street Journal</i></b><br></b><br> In the year 2204, humanity is expanding into the wider galaxy in leaps and bounds.

The technological progress of whoever was detonating them was exceptionally swift by the usual metric of emerging civilizations.<br><br>Metaviral spawn chewed into the cometry chunks that anchored the vast cluster, spinning out a string of flimsy receiver webs twenty kilometers across. They aligned themselves on the G-�class star fifty light-�years away, where the savage weapons were being deployed.<br><br>Sure enough, a torrent of weak electromagnetic signals was pouring out from the star&#x2019;s third planet. A sentient species was entering into its early scientific industrial state.<br><br>The Ne�na were concerned that so many nuclear weapons were being used. Clearly, the new species was disturbingly aggressive. Some of the cluster&#x2019;s minds welcomed that.<br><br>Analysis of the radio signals, now becoming analogue audiovisual broadcasts, revealed a bipedal race organized along geo-�tribal lines, and constantly in conflict. Their specific biochemical composition was one that, from the Ne�na perspective, gave them sadly short lives. That was posited as the probable reason behind their faster than usual technological progression.<br><br>That there would be an expedition was never in doubt; the Ne�na saw that as their duty no matter what kind of life evolved on distant worlds. The only question now concerned the level of assistance to be offered. Those who welcomed the new species&#x2019; aggressive qualities wanted to make the full spectrum of Ne�na technology available. They almost prevailed.<br><br>The spherical insertion ship that left the cluster&#x2014;�it didn&#x2019;t know if it was one of many being dispatched, or alone&#x2014;�measured a hundred meters in diameter, a mass comprised of active molecule blocks. It spent three months accelerating up to thirty percent of light speed along a course to Altair&#x2014;�a trip that took just over a hundred years. During the lonely voyage the ship&#x2019;s controlling sentience continued to monitor the electromagnetic signals coming from the young civilization that was its ultimate goal. It built up an impressive knowledge base of human biology, as well as a comprehensive understanding of their constantly evolving tribal political and economic structures.<br><br>When the ship reached Altair, it performed a complex flyby maneuver, which aligned it perfectly on Sol. After that, the physical section of the sentience&#x2019;s memory that contained all the astrogation data of the flight from the cluster to Altair was jettisoned and the constituent blocks deactivated. Its weakened atomic structure broke apart into an expanding cloud of dust, which was quickly dispersed by Altair&#x2019;s solar wind. Now, if it was ever intercepted, the insertion ship could never betray the position of the Ne�na abode cluster&#x2014;�for it no longer knew where it was.<br><br>The last fifty years of the voyage were spent formatting an emplacement strategy. By now, human ingenuity had produced starships that were flying past the insertion ship in the other direction, in quest of new worlds out among the stars. The information blasting out from Earth and the solar system&#x2019;s asteroid habitats had become increasingly sophisticated, yet, conversely, there was a lot less of it. Radio signals had been in decline since the internet had begun to carry the bulk of human data traffic. For the final twenty years of the insertion ship&#x2019;s approach it received little apart from entertainment broadcasts, and even those were shrinking year by year. But it had enough.<br><br>It flew in south of the ecliptic, shedding cold mass in irregular bursts like a black comet&#x2014;�a deceleration maneuver that took three years. This was always the riskiest part of the voyage. The humans&#x2019; solar system was scattered with a great many astronomical sensors scanning the universe for cosmological abnormalities. By the time it passed the Kuiper belt, the insertion ship was down to twenty-�five meters in diameter. It emitted no magnetic or gravitational fields. The outer shell was fully radiation absorbent, so there was no albedo, making it invisible to any telescopes. Thermal emission was zero.<br><br>No one perceived its arrival.<br><br>Inside, four biologics began to grow within molecular initiators, attaining physical patterns the ship&#x2019;s sentience had designed, based on the information it had acquired during the long voyage.<br><br>They were human in size and shape; skeletons and organs carried the mimicry down to a biochemical level. Their DNA was equally authentic. You would have to go a lot deeper into the cells to find any abnormality; only a detailed audit of the organelles would reveal alien molecular structures.<br><br>It was the minds of the biologics that gave the insertion ship the greatest difficulty. Human mental processes were complex verging on paradoxical. Worse, it suspected the performances in all the fictional dramas it received were overemphasizing emotional responses. So it constructed a stable primary architecture of thought routines, while including a fast learning and adaptive integration procedure.<br><br>As it closed to within a million kilometers of Earth, the insertion ship discarded the last of its reaction mass as it performed a final deceleration maneuver. Now it was basically just falling toward the southernmost tip of South America. Tiny course correction ejecta refined the descent vector, steering it at Tierra del Fuego, which was still thirty minutes from greeting the dawn. Even if it was detected now, it would simply appear to be a small chunk of natural space debris.<br><br>It hit the upper atmosphere and began to peel apart into four pear-�shaped segments. The remaining matter broke away in fizzing sparks that produced a short-�lived but beautiful starburst display streaking through the mesosphere. Below it, sheltered under their blanket of thick winter cloud, the residents of Ushuaia, the southernmost city on Earth, remained oblivious of their interstellar visitor.<br><br>Each segment carried on down, aerobraking with increasing severity as the atmosphere thickened around them. They slowed to subsonic velocity three kilometers above the surface, plunging through the clouds, still unobserved by anyone on the planet.<br><br>The segments were aimed at a small inlet a few kilometers west of the city, where, even in AD 2162, the rugged land lay unclaimed by developers. Two hundred meters from the shore, four tall splash plumes shot up into the air like thick geysers, crowning and splattering down on the slushy ice that bobbed along the waters of the Beagle Channel.<br><br>The Ne�na metahumans floated to the surface. All that now remained of the insertion ship landing segments was a thick layer of active molecule blocks covering their skin like a pelt of translucent gel, insulating them from the dangerously cold water. They began to swim ashore.<br><br>The beach was a narrow strip of gray stones cluttered with dead branches. A dense woodland occupied the slope above it. The aliens scrambled a short way up the incline as the pale dawn light began to seep through the murky clouds. Their protective layer liquidized, draining down into the stones where it would be flushed away by the next high tide. For the first time, they drew air down into their lungs.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, that is cold!&#x201d; one exclaimed.<br><br>&#x201c;Good classification,&#x201d; another agreed through chattering teeth. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll go with it.&#x201d;<br><br>They looked at one another in the gray light. Two were crying from the emotional impact of arrival, one was smiling in wonder, while the fourth appeared singularly unimpressed by the bleak landscape. Each carried a small pack of outdoor clothing copied from a winter wear ad broadcast eighteen months earlier. They hurried to put it on.<br><br>When they were fully dressed, they set off along an ancient track up through the trees until they came to the remnants of National Route Three, which led to Ushuaia.<br><br>The Assessment Team<br><br>Feriton Kayne, New York, June 23, 2204<br><br>I was never really that impressed with New York. The natives always banged on about how it was the city that never sleeps, how it had elevated itself to the center of the human universe. Self-�justifying their choice of living in cramped, overpriced apartments&#x2014;�even today, when they could live anywhere on the planet and commute in through a dozen different Connexion hubs. They claimed it still had the buzz, the vibe, the kick. Bohemians came to dose up on the experience, maaan that helped them create their art, while corporate drones sweated through their junior management years to prove commitment. But for service staff proximity was simply convenient, while the truly poor couldn&#x2019;t afford to leave. And yes: Guilty, I lived in SoHo. Not that I&#x2019;m junior management. Right there on my desk the name plate says: Feriton Kayne, Deputy Director, Connexion Exosolar Security Division. And if you can work out what I actually do from that, you&#x2019;re smarter than most.<br><br>My office was on the seventy-�seventh floor of the Connexion Corp tower. Ainsley Zangari wanted his global headquarters in Manhattan, and did he ever want everyone to know about it. There are few other people alive who could get a site on West 59th Street just along from Columbus Circle. He had to keep the fa�ade of the old hotel as the base of his 120-�story glass-�and-�carbon monstrosity&#x2014;�why I don&#x2019;t know; it had no architectural value as far as I can make out, but City Hall listed it as a landmark structure. So there you have it. Not even Ainsley Zangari, the richest man there&#x2019;s ever been, can argue City Hall out of heritage.<br><br>I&#x2019;m not complaining. My office gives me the greatest conceivable view out over the city and Central Park&#x2014;�one that the mere super-�rich along Park Avenue can&#x2019;t afford. I&#x2019;ve actually had to position my desk so I work with my back to the floor-�to-�ceiling window. I&#x2019;d be too distracted otherwise. Mind, it is a swivel chair.<br><br>That cloudless June afternoon I was standing looking out at the view, mesmerized as always; the vista resembled one of those seventeenth-�century oil paintings where everything glows with heavenly radiance.<br><br>Kandara Martinez was shown in by a receptionist. The corporate mercenary wore a plain black singlet under a jacket from some midrange fashion house. The way she carried herself made it look like a military uniform. That part of her life just never left her, I guess.<br><br>Sandjay, my altme, splashed the data at me, which the tarsus lenses I wore over my eyeballs presented as a grid of green-�and-�purple text. The file didn&#x2019;t tell me much I didn&#x2019;t already know. She had enrolled in Mexico City&#x2019;s Heroico Colegio Militar when she was nineteen. After graduation she saw several active deployments in the Urban Rapid Suppression Force. Then her parents were killed by a drone bomb some bunch of anti-�imperialist anarchist whack-�jobs launched at the sneering symbol of their evil foreign economic �oppressors&#x2014;�or, in English, the Italian remote drone systems factory where her father worked. After that her escalating kill rate in action started to &#x201c;concern&#x201d; her superiors. She received an honorable discharge in 2187. Freelance corporate security ever since&#x2014;�the real dark jobs.<br><br>In the flesh she was 170 centimeters tall, with chestnut hair, cut short, and gray eyes. I wasn&#x2019;t sure if they were real or gened-�up; they didn&#x2019;t quite seem to belong with the rest of her Mexican ancestry. There&#x2019;d certainly been some bodywork. She kept herself trim&#x2014;�in her line of work that was survival 101&#x2014;�but that couldn&#x2019;t account for the thickness of her limbs; her legs and arms were heavily muscled. Gened-�up or Kcells; the file didn&#x2019;t say. Ms. Martinez left a very small dataprint on solnet.<br><br>&#x201c;Thank you for accepting the contract,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m a lot happier knowing you&#x2019;re coming with us.&#x201d; Which was only partially true. Her presence made me uncomfortable, but then I know whom she&#x2019;s eliminated during her career.<br><br>&#x201c;I was curious,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;because we all know Connexion has so few people in its own security division.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah, about that. We might need something that goes beyond our guys&#x2019; pay grade.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sounds interesting, Feriton.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;My boss wants protection, serious protection. We&#x2019;re dealing with the unknown here. This expedition . . . it&#x2019;s different. The artifact we&#x2019;ve found is alien.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;So you said. Is it Olyix?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t see how it could be.&#x201d;<br><br>A small smile lifted her lips. &#x201c;Not going to hide from you, I&#x2019;m very interested. And flattered. Why me?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Reputation,&#x201d; I lied. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re the best.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Bullshit.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Seriously. We have to keep this small; the three other people coming with us represent some serious political interests. So I wanted someone with a genuine track record.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re worried that rivals will find out about where we&#x2019;re headed? What sort of artifact have you found?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Can&#x2019;t tell you that until we&#x2019;re en route.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Are you retro engineering its tech? Is that why you&#x2019;re worried about rivals?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;This isn&#x2019;t about new technology and market impact. We have a bigger problem than that.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh?&#x201d; She lifted her eyebrow in query.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll get a full briefing when we&#x2019;re underway. Everybody does.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Okay, that&#x2019;s a reasonable containment strategy. But I do need to know: Is it hostile?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No. Or at least, not yet. Which is where you come in. We need to pack a large punch in a small place. Just in case.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Even more flattered.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;One last thing, which is why you and I are having this meeting before I introduce you to the rest of the team.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;This doesn&#x2019;t sound good.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;There are some first-�contact protocols involved, severe ones. Alpha Defense insisted. We&#x2019;re going to be very isolated for the duration of this mission&#x2014;�something none of us are familiar with. Today, no matter what disaster hits you, everybody can shout for help wherever they are. Everyone functions under the assumption an emergency team is two minutes away. It&#x2019;s all we know. I consider that to be a weakness, especially in this situation. If things go wrong&#x2014;�badly wrong&#x2014;�that&#x2019;s when the Alpha Defense first-�contact protocol applies.&#x201d;<br><br>She caught on fast. I could see the slight change in body posture, humor retreating, muscles tightening.<br><br>&#x201c;If they&#x2019;re hostile, they can&#x2019;t know about us,&#x201d; she said.<br><br>&#x201c;No prisoners. No data downloads.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Really?&#x201d; Her humor swept back in. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re worried about an alien invasion? That&#x2019;s very quaint. What does Ainsley Zangari think they&#x2019;re going to plunder, our gold and our women?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We don&#x2019;t know what they are, so until we do . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The Olyix turned out okay. And they had a shitload of antimatter on board the Salvation of Life. There isn&#x2019;t another conventional power source powerful enough to accelerate a vessel that size up to a decent fraction of light speed.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We were fortunate with them,&#x201d; I said carefully. &#x201c;Their religion gives them a whole different set of priorities to us. All they want to do is travel across space in their arkship to the end of time, where they believe their God will be waiting for them. They don&#x2019;t want to expand into new star systems and bioform planets to live on; it&#x2019;s a whole different imperative to ours. I guess we didn&#x2019;t really understand what alien meant until they arrived in the Sol system. But, Kandara, do you really want to gamble our species&#x2019; survival on every race being as benign as the Olyix? It&#x2019;s been sixty years since they arrived, and we&#x2019;ve both benefited from trade.

He&#x2019;d served with the famous Night Stalkers on countless such missions. This one was different. Months later, he regained consciousness in a U.S. military hospital with no memory of how he&#x2019;d gotten there.

For a mission such as this, you never wear a mark of unit or rank or anything that might betray your identity, just in case things go wrong. If taken prisoner, you don&#x2019;t want anything on your person that might distinguish you as being particularly special.<br> <br>Like my fellow warriors, I&#x2019;d sanitized myself completely, removing all patches from my clothing and not carrying a single piece of ID or family memento, anything that might link me to my nationality or my unit. Carrying even a photo of my wife and three infant boys was a strict no-no.<br> <br>Such precautions had to be taken utterly seriously when involved in this kind of war against this kind of an adversary. We were in Ecuador, training that country&#x2019;s special forces to fight FARC&#x2014;the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia&#x2014;a notorious rebel group that finances its operations from kidnap and ransom, illegal mining, and most of all, drugs.<br> <br>FARC&#x2019;s narcotics-smuggling network stretches from the South American jungle as far north as the USA and east across the Atlantic into Europe. With an income of some $300 million a year and tens of thousands of armed fighters under its command, FARC is a well-armed battle-hardened force constrained by none of the normal rules of war. They have gained a reputation for horrific brutality and are the last people you&#x2019;d ever want to mess with.<br> <br>I checked my watch. We were twenty minutes to getting airborne.<br> <br>I glanced at my two jump buddies, Will and Travis&#x2014;their sleeves rolled up, shirts unbuttoned at the neck&#x2014;looking easy and relaxed. Hailing from the Special Operations Aviation Regiment (SOAR), a renowned U.S. Army special forces unit, they looked like they were stepping out for a practice jump over Florida and not heading into a jungle full of the world&#x2019;s foremost narco-rebels. It was the late 1990s, and the SOAR&#x2014;also known as the 160th, the Night Stalkers&#x2014;had taken casualties on previous missions here. What we were stepping into was a deadly serious business. But for Will and Travis it was just another day of doing what they loved. And, truth be told, it was getting to feel that way for me, too.<br> <br>Since I was an Air Force Special Operations guy, it had taken a good while for the SOAR to come to accept me. The competition between army and air force is merciless, and we&#x2019;d never want it any other way, since the intense rivalry serves to sharpen both arms of the military, but I&#x2019;d been with the SOAR for months now and I was getting to feel like very much one of the boys.<br> <br>We were here working with the Ecuadorian special forces&#x2014;the 9th Special Forces Brigade, better known as PATRIA&#x2014;to combat FARC and put a stop to the illegal drugs trade. But practically speaking, we could never train these guys if our remit only ever kept us in the rear with the gear. The only way to do it properly was to go out into the field alongside them. Though the Ecuadorians were lined up with us, they were a long way from being sanitized. Each wore the distinctive PATRIA badge on his left sleeve, a skull flanked by daggers with a cobra twined through its empty eye sockets. The way they saw it, if they were captured by FARC, they&#x2019;d face a horrific death anyway, so why bother disguising what unit they were from?<br> <br>The enmity between the narco-rebels and the armed forces here ran very deep, and neither side was inclined to show much mercy. We were about to fly north into the remote and lawless Cordillera Central, a spine of jungle-clad mountains snaking into neighboring Colombia. Intelligence reports suggested that FARC was using the rivers there to traffic drugs from the heart of the rain forest to the outside world, with America as their likely end destination. The PATRIA boys planned to stake out one of those rivers, put a stop to any narcotics operations, and take prisoners from whom further intelligence could be garnered to help break the drug-trafficking network.<br> <br>Our role was to train them to prosecute these kinds of missions more effectively, and this was the type of tasking that we could wholeheartedly believe in. We were fighting the good fight against entirely the right kind of enemy, and despite their lack of experience and expertise (or maybe because of it), we&#x2019;d grown close to the PATRIA guys. They were ideal trainees, like the proverbial sponges, ready to suck up all that we could throw at them. And boy, did they have a lot to learn.<br> <br>From behind me, I heard a high-pitched whine as the starter motors on the Hercules fired up the aircraft&#x2019;s engines. Gradually, the massive hook-bladed propellers spooled up to speed, the avgas&#x2014;aviation fuel&#x2014;burning fierce and heady in the hot sludgy air.<br> <br>As I turned to mount up the aircraft, Jim offered me a high five. &#x201c;Looks like we&#x2019;re on! Way to go, Goshman!&#x201d;<br> <br>My SOAR teammates called me Goshman because I never cussed much, and especially not around my parents or anyone in authority. That was just the way my folks had raised me. The most I ever managed was a &#x201c;gosh.&#x201d; Hence the nickname. But that hadn&#x2019;t stopped the 16oth from making me one of their own. Recently, I&#x2019;d been pulled aside by our unit commander. He&#x2019;d told me that since I was serving with the SOAR, I&#x2019;d get to wear the Night Stalkers flash as well as my Air Force Special Operations Badge. I had the Night Stalkers badge on my right shoulder and my Air Force Special Operations badge on my left chest pocket. It was highly unusual to wear both, and I felt hugely honored to do so.<br> <br>We mounted up the aircraft; I pulled on my helmet and fastened the strap beneath my chin, settling into the fold-down canvas seat. We took to the skies. The aircraft executed a short climb, then thundered low and fast across the treetops, keeping below any radar. Going low also reduced the threat of ground fire because you&#x2019;d flash past in a matter of seconds and be gone.<br> <br>I was seated in the plane&#x2019;s tail section, next to a massive heap of rucksacks secured to the floor by netting. Through the partially open ramp, I could see the jungle speeding by. It felt close enough almost to reach out and touch the highest treetops. The pilot sure knew his stuff. If he had taken the Hercules any lower, its propellers would have been shaving the topmost branches.<br> <br>We sped onward across the carpet of green, the wind noise and the throbbing roar of the turbines killing the chance of any chat. Now and again there was a break in the forest canopy, marking a river, a narrow trail, or a jungle village. But 99 percent of what we were flying over was pure wilderness.<br> <br>As with so many previous flights, I bore a special responsibility for getting this one airborne. I just hoped and prayed that I&#x2019;d called it right this time. As I gazed out over the jungle, I reflected on what had brought me to this position&#x2014;an air force guy embedded within an elite army unit. I hailed from a tiny, little-known outfit&#x2014;the 10th Combat Weather Squadron, part of Air Force Special Operations Command. The 10th was a seventy-two-strong unit when I was a part of it. Only sixty of us were jump-trained and mission-qualified and thus able to undertake the kind of task I was now on.<br> <br>Combat weathermen do pretty much what you&#x2019;d guess: We draw up the weather picture for combat operations. As such, we need to be first in on any mission, predicting the weather at the target&#x2014;and above the target, if it&#x2019;s an airborne mission&#x2014;and helping determine if it can go ahead.<br> <br>Air Force Weather School is one of the hardest military courses there is. It&#x2019;s not just predicting when it&#x2019;s going to be partly cloudy so folks can better plan their barbecues. It&#x2019;s about anticipating what type of cloud formations will be present at what altitudes, what the visibility will be for aircraft heading through those clouds, and when exactly they&#x2019;ll hit the heart of a thunderstorm. It&#x2019;s learning how a hailstone forms with concentric rings, like a tree, and what makes it burst out the top of a cloud like popcorn and plummet to earth in a dark curtain of ice. It&#x2019;s getting to know local weather, and predicting when storms may occur, and what the conditions will be like when they do. It&#x2019;s working out how to read the weather in order to make snap decisions on the ground.<br> <br>Mission-critical decisions.<br> <br>When I went through weather school, we started as sixteen, and only three from our original class made it all the way. We had to score 80 percent or higher on all tests to move to the next section. Weather school took about a year, with over fifteen hundred hours of classroom instruction.<br> <br>Combat weathermen have to pass Air Force Special Operations selection and combat weather school. Having done so, I felt as if I&#x2019;d truly made it. My first assignment with the 10th Combat Weather was on attachment to the army&#x2019;s 3rd Special Forces Group at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. Life was good&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. apart from one thing. My job&#x2014;briefing pilots on weather conditions&#x2014;didn&#x2019;t really do it for me.<br> <br>I stuck at it for about two years, until word went around that the SOAR was seeking volunteers. When you have guys going deep behind enemy lines, as the SOAR do, it&#x2019;s vital that they know what weather&#x2019;s coming. Only air force guys can become combat weathermen. The SOAR is an iconic regiment, and my commander personally asked me if I&#x2019;d be willing to join them.<br> <br>I talked it through with my wife, Carla. She&#x2019;d always been supportive of everything I&#x2019;d ever done, but for once she asked me not to follow my dream. We both knew that operations with the SOAR were dangerous. Carla told me that she had a dark premonition, a really bad feeling, about this one. She had a sense that something terrible was going to happen to me if I transferred to the SOAR.<br> <br>But my commander stressed how much they needed me, and I sure wanted to go. In due course I transferred from Fort Bragg to Hunter Army Airfield, the headquarters of the 3rd Battalion of the 160th Night Stalkers, and moved my family up there, too. Carla and I had three boys under the age of four, so ours was one busy household. We purchased a modest one-story house with a wraparound porch, room enough for the boys to bounce around in.<br> <br>At Hunter I was introduced to the &#x201c;Skiff,&#x201d; a hyper-secure underground vault protected by a series of massive code-activated doors. The Skiff was the nerve center of SOAR operations, and it was from there that I would study the weather as it affected their missions around the world. I threw myself into my new task, striving to prove that an air force guy could be as good as any army man. I was at the front of all the training runs. I had to be. If I slipped back, I&#x2019;d get all the usual abuse about being a &#x201c;pansy-assed air force guy.&#x201d; And, like many a Morgan before me, I thrilled to the challenge.<br> <br>I grew to feel at home among these army aviators. Despite Carla&#x2019;s warnings, I thrived.<br> <br>I worked my weather data like a magician. I conjured statistics to predict how storms would impact visibility or communications, or how wind speeds at the different altitudes of a parachute jump might enable a squad of paratroopers to hit a landing zone pretty much simultaneously. I sought current and tidal data so we could do airborne insertions into water: I knew that if the current was more than one mile an hour, our guys would not be able to make headway against it while swimming. If we aimed to hit a beach, I needed to know the high- and low-tide times so I could advise on the best time of landing. Because sound travels more clearly through water than air, in damp, humid conditions I had to warn our guys that the enemy would hear us coming from much farther away.<br> <br>I tried to use the weather to best advantage, while warning how it might hinder operations. After prolonged rain, a river might be rendered too hazardous to cross, making our planned exit from a target unworkable. If it was a sniper mission, I needed to predict how crosswinds might hamper the shot. If it was a night operation, I needed to know what lunar illumination we should expect. There might well be a full moon, but if there was heavy cloud cover, little light would filter through. Conversely, there might be too much light, causing human forms to cast shadows&#x2014;making us visible and vulnerable to ambush.<br> <br>If I ever felt the weather picture made a mission look undoable, I&#x2019;d make that known to my commanders. My final call&#x2014;the weather call&#x2014;would be made four to six hours ahead of the mission start time, which was just what I&#x2019;d done today, here in Ecuador. For weeks prior to the mission, I&#x2019;d studied the local weather patterns. Our area of operations sat right on the equatorial trough, a tropical storm corridor running along the equator. Weatherwise, it was a hugely volatile region. I&#x2019;d already inserted two combat weather guys around a hundred kilometers east of our target. As the weather blew in from that direction, they would be our eyes and ears, warning us of whatever was coming. Trained climatic observers, they&#x2019;d transmit key data: wind direction and speed, air temperature, cloud types and height, and dew point. The dew point is the temperature at which the air becomes saturated with moisture, so fog or rain will form, impacting on visibility. They&#x2019;d warn us if cumulus cloud was incoming, since it tends to build rapidly into violent tropical storms.<br> <br>It was largely by using their data that I&#x2019;d been able to green-light today&#x2019;s mission. But once we were on the ground, I&#x2019;d carry on monitoring the weather every step of the way. Stuffed into my rucksack were the specialist tools of my trade, chiefly a portable combat weather laptop via which I could acquire my own data on the weather above us or download stats from the Skiff.<br> <br>The area we were flying into was heavily mountainous. We had hundreds of millions of dollars&#x2019; worth of equipment in the air with us, plus several dozen men-at-arms. There were thunderstorms every day over the Cordillera Central, and a bad downdraft could cause an aircraft to fall out of the sky or scatter injured parachutists across a wide swath of terrain.<br> <br>That was why I bore such a heavy responsibility for the present mission.<br> <br>By now, the SOAR guys had pretty much come to trust my decisions. A while back we&#x2019;d been on a training exercise in Kentucky. I&#x2019;d been on the ground with an advance force of SOAR operators, preparing to call in the main drop. But the area had been hit by a series of tornadoes, and for a while it had looked like the exercise was a no-go. Then a narrow weather window had opened and I&#x2019;d called the aircraft in. We&#x2019;d driven out to mark the landing zone so the parachutists would know exactly where to put down. We were halfway to the LZ when the heavens opened&#x2014;massive hailstones. The inbound aircraft were close now, and unless I called it off, we risked having parachutists jumping out of the skies into a hellish hailstorm.<br> <br>As the hailstones had pounded onto the roof of our vehicle, I&#x2019;d felt the SOAR guys staring at me and known what they were thinking: How the hell did he get it so wrong? No doubt about it, I was sweating it big-time. But I stuck with my gut instinct. The weather window was coming.<br> <br>The jump remained on.<br> <br>Sure enough, the hail had stopped, we&#x2019;d gotten the pa...</p><h2>Injustice for All (Joe Dillard Series)</h2><p>A criminal court judge is found hanging from a tree.

All rights reserved.<br>&nbsp;<br>PREFACE<br>&nbsp;<br>In 1968 a British pop star and the refugees from two seminal Los Angeles bands gathered in a cottage on Lookout Mountain Avenue in Laurel Canyon, the slightly seedy, camp-like neighborhood of serpentine one-lane roads, precipitous hills, fragrant eucalyptus trees, and softly crumbling bungalows set down improbably in the middle of Los Angeles, and sang together for the first time. The occupant of the cottage, which had moldering shake shingles and draft-prone casement windows, was a Canadian painter, poet, and folksinger named Joni Mitchell. The British pop star, sporting a wisp of a goatee and a thick Manchester brogue, was Graham Nash, founding member of the Hollies. The refugees were Stephen Stills, late of the Buffalo Springfield, writer and singer of "For What It's Worth," who had three years before auditioned for the Monkees and, having failed, recommended his friend, a folkie named Peter Torkelson; and David Crosby, late of the Byrds and "Mr. Tambourine Man," possessed of a Buffalo Bill mustache, an immaculate harmony voice, and piercing eyes that Mitchell, with typical literary flourish, likened to star sapphires. (Crosby produced Mitchell's debut album, <i>Song to a Seagull</i>.) So it was that Nash, Stills, and Crosby sat in Mitchell's living room on Lookout Mountain, in the heart of Laurel Canyon, in the epicenter of L.A.'s nascent rock music industry, and for the first time, began to sing together.<br>&nbsp;<br>It is a measure of Laurel Canyon's mythmaking powers that this particular watershed may have actually occurred not at Mitchell's cottage--though that's the way Nash and plenty of others remember it--but a mile away in the living room of Cass Elliot of the Mamas and the Papas, who along with Mitchell briefly co-reigned as unofficial queen of the canyon, one an inscrutable poet-genius, the other a bosomy, meddling mother figure. What is certain is that within the year, Nash, Stills, and Crosby apotheosized into Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash, the third group with Laurel Canyon roots within as many years--after the Byrds and Buffalo Springfield--to score a knockout with their first record. Nash moved into Mitchell's cottage on Lookout, there to write his ode to countercultural domestic bliss, "Our House." Mitchell, in turn, wrote and recorded "Ladies of the Canyon," her paean to the strange bohemian netherland where she and Nash nurtured their affair and where it would soon become evident that some of the twentieth century's most talented and enterprising young men and women had gathered at just the right moment.<br>&nbsp;<br>Laurel Canyon had been filling up with musicians from Los Angeles, New York, and London since the mid-1960s: Mitchell was a transplant from New York via Saskatoon; Carole King had recently decamped to a place on Appian Way; so had Nico, the Teutonic waif from Andy Warhol's Factory. Up the street from Mitchell's place were John Phillips, Michelle Phillips, and Denny Doherty of the Mamas and the Papas, who, until they moved west and recorded "California Dreamin'" and "Monday, Monday," had busked around as semi-obscure folksingers. British bands touring the States made it a point to stop by Laurel Canyon for a party or two--Beatles, Stones, Animals, Yardbirds, and the rest. Some never left--the British blues legend John Mayall bought a house just over the ridge from Mitchell's place. It was Brigadoon meets the Brill Building, and the repercussions thirty-odd years later continue to pour from radios, iPods, and concert stages around the world.</p><h2>Shop Cats of New York</h2><p><p><em>Humans of New York</em> meets <em>The French Cat</em> in this carefully cultivated, gorgeous full-color collection featuring New York&#x2019;s iconic felines and the stories behind them.</p><p>They inhabit New York City&#x2019;s most legendary and coziest spots&#x2014;the Algonquin Hotel, a whiskey distillery, Bleecker Street Records, and a host of yoga studios,&nbsp; bookstores, and bike shops in between.

And it is also Cassie's story--Cassie Logan, an independent girl who discovers over the course of an important year why having land of their own is so crucial to the Logan family, even as she learns to draw strength from her own sense of dignity and self-respect.</p><p>In all Mildred D. Taylor's unforgettable novels she recounts "not only the joy of growing up in a large and supportive family, but my own feelings of being faced with segregation and bigotry." Her Newbery Medal-winning <i>Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry</i> tells the story of one African American family, fighting to stay together and strong in the face of brutal racist attacks, illness, poverty, and betrayal in the Deep South of the 1930s. Nine-year-old Cassie Logan, growing up protected by her loving family, has never had reason to suspect that any white person could consider her inferior or wish her harm. But during the course of one devastating year when her community begins to be ripped apart by angry night riders threatening African Americans, she and her three brothers come to understand why the land they own means so much to their Papa. "Look out there, Cassie girl. All that belongs to you. You ain't never had to live on nobody's place but your own and long as I live and the family survives, you'll never have to. That's important. You may not understand that now but one day you will. Then you'll see."<p> Twenty-five years after it was first published, this special anniversary edition of the classic strikes as deep and powerful a note as ever. Taylor's vivid portrayal of ugly racism and the poignancy of Cassie's bewilderment and gradual toughening against social injustice and the men and women who perpetuate it, will remain with readers forever. Two award-winning sequels, <i>Let the Circle Be Unbroken</i> and <i>The Road to Memphis</i>, and a long-awaited prequel, <i>The Land</i>, continue the profoundly moving tale of the Logan family.

It takes the events of one turbulent year--the year of the night riders and the burnings, the year a white girl humiliates Cassie in public simply because she is black--to show Cassie that having a place of their own is the Logan family's lifeblood. It is the land that gives the Logans their courage and pride, for no matter how others may degrade them, the Logans possess something no one can take away.</p><h2>A Family Guide to the Biblical Holidays: With Activities for All Ages</h2><p>This giant book gives an extensive look at the nine annual holidays Passover, Unleavened Bread, Firstfruits, Pentecost, Trumpets, Day of Atonement, Tabernacles, Hanukkah, Purim and the weekly holidaythe Sabbath!

It anchors a comprehensive kanji learning system, supported by the KLC Graded Reading Sets, the KLC Green Book, the KLC Wall Chart, and keystojapanese.com (a user-support website for forming study groups, exchanging tips, and tracking one's learning progress with points and level ranks). The KLC is also cross-referenced for convenient use with Kodansha's companion volume, the Kanji Learner's Dictionary. <br><br> THE FOUR ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS FOR KANJI LEARNING<br> The 2,300 entries of this main textbook adeptly integrate the four essential elements for mastering kanji meanings:<br><br> (1) Accurate keywords. Each character's core meaning is encapsulated in a concise, easily memorized keyword. The keywords for all 2,300 entries have been carefully chosen to be semantically accurate and to integrate the character's various senses into a core idea.<br><br> (2) Vocabulary to illustrate the keywords. The concept captured in each keyword is illustrated with up to five sample vocabulary items, carefully selected to clarify how the kanji is used in building typical words and phrases. <br><br> (3) Mnemonic aids for remembering the keywords. Each entry contains an original mnemonic aid that is carefully designed to help learners remember the character's core meanings. Mnemonic aids pay special attention to helping learners immediately recognize each kanji and distinguish it from lookalikes.<br><br> (4) Rational learning sequence. The course's widely praised sequence represents a breakthrough in kanji pedagogy. It aids learning by introducing kanji components step by step, grouping related kanji together, and building vocabulary progressively - all while teaching kanji in rough order of importance. <br><br> A SELF-GUIDING, SELF-REINFORCING COURSE<br> The course arranges all the information needed to master 2,300 characters into a streamlined, self-guiding, and mnemonically self-reinforcing curriculum. Sample compounds include only such kanji as have previously been learned, ensuring that learners are able to understand and use each compound, and providing a built-in review of all the kanji already studied. <br><br> THE ULTIMATE KANJI LEARNING RESOURCE<br> * Provides a sophisticated, pedagogically sound method for remembering the core meaning of each kanji, conveniently summarized in concise keywords to facilitate memorization.<br> * Introduces the meaning and usage of each grapheme the first time it appears, helping learners seamlessly acquire new kanji based on a sound understanding of their component parts.<br> * Innovatively uses concrete imagery to simplify complex characters and make their meanings immediately recognizable in their graphical forms.<br> * Teaches characters in a pedagogically effective sequence, presenting graphically related characters together to help learners give significance to their contrastive features as they learn them, and thereby avoid having to re-learn them later.<br> * Helps learners actively apply each character's principal meanings and readings using key vocabulary words, carefully chosen to illustrate the character's uses and to help learners employ it in everyday reading and written communication.<br> * Helps learners differentiate among graphically similar kanji by showing how to remember the characters in a mutually contrastive manner that connects their graphical distinctions to their underlying semantic differences. Along the way, the course introduces nearly 800 pairs of easily confused kanji.<br> * Helps students learn to write kanji accurately, by indicating each kanji's stroke order and placing careful emphasis on distinctions among graphically similar characters.<br> * Includes all the kanji needed for genuine literacy in Japanese, including all 196 characters added to the official Joyo Kanji List in 2010.</p><p>I created the kanji course because it was the kind of tool I wished had existed when I was studying kanji myself.

Guido plans to write poetry while Vincent feels confident he will win a Nobel prize for physics. When Guido spots Holly while exiting a museum, he can immediately sense that she will difficult, quirky, and hard to live with. He loves her on sight. Vincent, open-minded and cheerful, meets Misty at work. Though she is a&nbsp; bored and misanthropic brunette, he finds himself desperate to know her. <br><br>Through courtship, jealousy, estrangement, and other perils, <i>Happy All the Time </i>follows four sane, intelligent, and good-intentioned people who manage to find love in spite of themselves.</p><p>Laurie Colwin is the author of five novels&#x2014;<i>Happy All the Time</i>; <i>Family Happiness</i>; <i>Goodbye Without Leaving</i>; <i>A Big Storm Knocked It Over</i>;<i> </i>and <i>Shine On, Bright and Dangerous Object</i>&#x2014;three collections of short stories&#x2014;<i>Passion and Affect</i>; <i>The Lone Pilgrim</i>; and <i>Another Marvelous Thing</i>&#x2014;and two collections of essays, <i>Home Cooking </i>and <i>More Home Cooking</i>. Colwin died in 1992.CHAPTER 1 &nbsp; <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Guido Morris and Vincent Cardworthy were third cousins. No one remembered which Morris had married which Cardworthy, and no one cared except at large family gatherings when this topic was introduced and subjected to the benign opinions of all. Vincent and Guido had been friends since babyhood. They had been strolled together in the same pram and as boys were often brought together, either at the Cardworthy house in Petrie, Connecticut, or at the Morris's in Boston to play marbles, climb trees, and set off cherry bombs in trash cans and mailboxes. As teenagers, they drank beer in hiding and practiced smoking Guido's father's cigars, which did not make them sick, but happy. As adults, they both loved a good cigar. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At college they fooled around, spent money, and wondered what would become of them when they grew up. Guido in tended to write poetry in heroic couplets and Vincent thought he might eventually win the Nobel Prize for physics. &nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In their late twenties they found themselves together again in Cambridge. Guido had gone to law school, had put in several years at a Wall Street law firm, and had discovered that his heart was not in his work, and so he had come back to graduate school to study Romance languages and literature. He was old for a graduate student, but he had decided to give himself a few years of useless pleasure before the true responsibilities of adulthood set upon him. Eventually, Guido was to go to New York and take over the stewardship of the Morris family trust-the Magna ,Charta Foundation, which gave money to civic art projects, artists of all sorts, and groups who wished to preserve landmarks and beautify their cities. The trust put out a bimonthly magazine devoted to the arts called Runnymeade. The money for all this came from a small fortune in textiles made in the early nineteenth century by a former sea captain by the name of Robert Morris. On one of his journeys, Robert Morris had married an Italian wife. Thereafter, all Morrises had Italianate names. Guido's grandfather was Almanso. His father was Sandro. His Uncle Giancarlo was the present administrator of the trust but he was getting on and Guido had been chosen to be eventual heir. &nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vincent had gone off to the University of London and had come back to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He had begun as a city planner, but his true field of interest was sanitation engineering, as it was called, although Vincent called it garbage. He was fascinated by its production, removal, and possible uses. His monographs on recycling, published in a magazine called City Limits, were beginning to make him famous in his field. He had also patented a small machine for home use that turned vegetable peelings, newspapers, and other kitchen leavings into valuable mulch, but nothing much had happened to it. Eventually he would go off to New York and give over his talent and energy to the Board of City Planning. &nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With their futures somewhat assured, they lolled around Cambridge and wondered whom they would marry. &nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One Sunday afternoon in January, Vincent and Guido found themselves perusing an exhibition of Greek vases at the Fogg Museum. The air outside was heavy and wet. Inside, it was overheated. It was the sort of day that forced you out of the house and gave you nothing back in return. They had been restless indoors, edgy out of doors, and had settled on the Fogg feeling that the sight of Greek vases might cool them out. They took several turns around. Guido delivered himself of a lecture on shape and form. Vincent gave his two minutes on the planning of the Greek city-state. None of this quieted them. They were looking for action, unsure of what kind and unwilling to seek it out. Vincent believed that the childish desire to kick tires and smash bottles against walls was never lost but relegated, in adulthood, to the subconscious where it jumped around creating just the sort of tension he was feeling. A sweaty round of handball or a couple of well-set cherry bombs would have done them both a lot of good, but it was too cold for the one and they were too refined for the other. Thus they were left with their own nerves. &nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the way out, Guido saw a girl sitting on a bench. She was slender, fine-boned, and her hair was the blackest, sleekest hair Guido had ever seen. It was worn the way Japanese children wear theirs, only longer. Her face seemed to print itself on his heart indelibly. &nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He stopped to stare at her and when she finally looked back, she glared through him. Guido nudged Vincent and they moved toward the bench on which she sat. &nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;The perspective is perfect," said Guido. &#x201c;Notice the subtlety of line and the intensity of color." <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Very painterly," said Vincent. &#x201c;What is it?" <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I'll have to look it up," said Guido. &#x201c;It appears to be an inspired mix of schools. Notice that the nose tilts-a very slight distortion giving the illusion of perfect clarity." He pointed to her collar. &#x201c;Note the exquisite folds around the neck and the drapery of the rest of the figure." &nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During this recitation, the girl sat perfectly still. Then, with deliberation, she lit a cigarette. &nbsp; &#x201c;Notice the arc of the arm," Guido continued. The girl opened her perfect mouth. &nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Notice the feeblemindedness that passes for wit among aging graduate students," she said. Then she got up and left. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next time Guido saw her, she was getting on the bus. The weather had become savagely cold and she was struggling to get change out of her wallet but her gloves were getting in her way. Finally, she pulled off one of her gloves with her teeth. Guido watched, entranced. She wore a fur hat and two scarves. As she came down the aisle, Guido hid behind his book and stared at her all the way to Harvard Square, which was, it turned out, their common destination. They confronted each other at the newsstand. She looked him up and down and walked away. &nbsp; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two weeks later she turned up under more felicitous circumstances. She appeared at a tearoom with a girl named Paula Pierce-Williams, whom Guido had known all his life. Paula waved at him, and he ambled over to their table. &nbsp; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Guido, this is Holly Sturgis," said Paula. &#x201c;And Holly, this is Guido Morris." &nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;We've met," said Holly Sturgis. &nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I never see you anymore, Guido," said Paula. &#x201c;Are you still working on your thesis?" &nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I'm almost finished," said Guido. &nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I can never remember what it's on," said Paula. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Medieval property law and its relationship to courtly love," said Guido. Holly Sturgis snickered. &nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Guido was not in the habit of falling in love with girls he saw on buses or in museums. He had had two serious love affairs and a small number of casual encounters. These he tried not to think about-they had puzzled and hurt him. He explained to himself that he was an old-fashioned man living in modern times, shackled with the belief that all real love affairs led to marriage. If they did not, they must in some way be bogus, built on bad faith or lack of true emotion. Therefore they were bad-once they were over, no matter how ardently one had begun them. The casual encounters Guido chalked up to sheer impulse. You could not call something that lasted for a day a love affair. Vincent tried to explain that these things were a matter of process-the process of growing up, but this was no consolation to Guido. In the case of his two serious love affairs, the partings had been equitable but not understandable: both the girls had married and sent him cards at Christmastime. Where, he wondered, had all that feeling gone?&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Now as he entered his thirties, he believed that one made mistakes in love until one was perfectly sure. That surety found its object in Holly Sturgis. He was serious in matters of the heart, and serious in matters of aesthetics. Something about Holly Sturgis struck him profoundly. One look announced her elegance and precision. Everything about her the calculation of her nloves, the grace with which she walked, the fact that she took off her gloves with her teeth-moved him. He believed that desire was mere shorthand for aesthetics and intuition. He wanted Holly Sturgis, plain and simple. He wanted access to that sleek, vital Japanese hair. He wanted her naked in his naked arms. He imagined that her shoulders smelled coolly of jasmine. &nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the way of people who fantasize rather than analyze, he knew that Holly was probably difficult, quirky, and hard to live with. It was obvious that she was precise-even her hair was precise. He knew all this because his daydreams were usually accurate-Vincent said he was a visual thinker. And so he imagined himself and Holly lying against crisp white sheets at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel. He did not bother to imagine how they got there or what led up to it. There would be anemones on the night table. Holly's hair would look like a sable paintbrush against the pillow and in his daydream she was smoking, balancing the ashtray on her stomach. The late afternoon light would be fuzzy with smoke. She would be entirely silent. He, of course, would be consumed by the event -it would be the first time they had been to bed together- and he saw himself looking cautiously at Holly, but unable to tell what that lovely, intelligent face was expressing or concealing from view. &nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Paula Pierce-Williams poured the tea. Then she went off to make a telephone call. &nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Did you engineer this?" Holly said. &nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Certainly not," said Guido. &#x201c;I can't help it if you follow me around." &nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I don't find that amusing. What do you want?" &nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I want you to be more gracious to people who fall at your feet." &nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I don't notice you falling at my feet." &nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Maybe you don't know how to look," said Guido. He saw Paula walking toward them and quickly asked Holly to have dinner with him. To his astonishment, she said yes. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their first encounter did not take place at the Ritz-Carlton, but at Holly's. The anemones Guido had daydreamed about were a series of ferns that hung above her bed and got into his eyes when he sat up. The sheets were crisp, but not white. They were printed with violets. The pillowcases were decorated with blue roses. Holly was smoking and the ashtray balanced on her stomach was a little Wedgwood plate decorated with black vines. &nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Holly's apartment was white and airy and it was as precise as Guido had imagined. Holly made small, absolute arrangements of things. On a white table was a bird's nest, an Egyptian figure in blue stone, a Russian match box, and a silver inkwell. The bed, before they had rumpled it, was made so that you could roll a dime across it. The sheets and pillows smelled of lavender. &nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was better than a daydream, better than those highly ornate night dreams that leave behind a sweet taste of inexplicable happiness in the morning. Guido turned to Holly and touched her dark, shining hair. She was wearing coral earrings the size of tuxedo studs and nothing else. It was a cold, rainy Saturday afternoon in late March, and Guido felt quite wiped out by sensation. Everything seemed uncommonly rich to him: the print on the sheets, the pattern on the quilt, Holly's gleaming hair and earrings. Her shoulders did smell of jasmine. When Guido turned to look at her, he saw on her face the look he had known he would see-a look so private and impenetrable and unclear that it rendered anything he thought of to say inappropriate. &nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Holly was the granddaughter of old Walker Sturgis, who had taught classics. Her father was an executive in a copper company and her mother wrote historical novels for children. She was an only child, an only grandchild, and she was nearly perfect. She had her own ways, Holly did. She decanted everything into glass and on her long kitchen shelves were row upon row of jars containing soap, pencils, cookies, salt, tea, paper clips, and dried beans. She could tell if one of her arrangements was off by so much as a sixteenth of an inch and she corrected it. She was constantly fighting off the urge to straighten paintings in other people's houses. In her own house, her collection of botanical watercolors was absolutely straight. The shoes in her closet were stuffed with pink tissue paper and her drawers were filled with lavender sachet. In each corner of her closet hung a pomander ball. &nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She liked to have tea on a tray and she was fond of unmatched china. The tray she brought to Guido held cups that bore forget-me-nots, a lily-of-the-valley sugar dish, a cream pitcher with red poppies, and a teapot covered with red roses and cornflowers. This tray, when set on the bed, contributed to Guido's sensory overload. He was touched to think that this effort had been made on his behalf, but when he got to know Holly better he learned that she made up identical trays for herself when she studied. &nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Guido had wondered if she knew how to cook. Her slight air of otherworldliness suggested that she did not, while her precision indicated that she did-in the way the Japanese did. He expected a dinner that looked like a painting. It turned out that she was a real marvel. Guido was surprised by the sheer deliciousness of it: food that good must, he felt, spring from a truly charitable, loving spirit. But charity did not seem to be in Holly's immediate emotional vocabulary. After a spectacular afternoon in bed, they had spent the rest of the day in polite half silence. Therefore, dinner almost did him in. Not only did it taste wonderful, it looked wonderful. Guido pegged Holly as a strong domestic sensualist. She had a positive genius for comfort but he was only a visitor: that comfort had been created long before he met her. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He spent a sleepless night next to her, very much aware, even when he dozed, that he was sleeping in a stranger's bed. &nbsp; He dreamed brief, disconnected dreams and woke suddenly, unsure of where he was. The sight of Holly did not immediately locate him-she seemed so dreamlike and unapproachable. He spent a long time gazing at her and realized that he did not want to go to sleep. He did not want to miss a minute of her. &nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But he did sleep, and when he woke...</p><h2>Japanese Maples: The Complete Guide to Selection and Cultivation, Fourth Edition</h2><p>Among the first titles published in 1978, with more than 150,000 copies in print in three editions, <i>Japanese Maples</i> is a Timber Press classic. Japanese maples are unlike any other tree. They boast a remarkable diversity of color, form, and texture. As a result of hundreds of years of careful breeding, they take the center stage in any garden they are found. In the last decade, the number of Japanese maple cultivars available to gardeners has doubled and there is a pressing need for an up-to-date reference. This new fourth edition offers detailed descriptions of over 150 new introductions, updates to plant nomenclature, and new insights into established favorites. Gardeners will relish the practical advice that puts successful cultivation within everyone's grasp. Accurate identification is made simple with over 600 easy-to-follow descriptions and 500 color photographs.<br></p><p>J. D. Vertrees (1915--1993) was an entomologist, nurseryman, and educator who collected rare and unusual maples in southern Oregon.&nbsp;He was probably the most knowledgeable grower of Japanese maples in his time, amassing an impressive list of awards. His 1.5-acre arboretum at Maplewood Nursery had the largest collection of Japanese maples in the United States. In 1997, <i>Japanese Maples</i> was selected by the American Horticultural Society as one of the 75 Great American Garden Books.<br><br>Peter Gregory, retired manager at Westonbirt Arboretum in Gloucestershire, England, is the chairman and co-founder of the Maple Society and the editor of its journal. He has been involved with tree research, including maples, for more than five decades. He lives in the UK.<b>Preface to the Fourth Edition</b><br> When J. D. Vertrees published <i>Japanese Maples</i> in 1978, he wanted to provide a comprehensive source of information on the culture, identification, and nomenclature of Japanese maple cultivars. He also intended to reduce confusion and bring stability to the naming of these cultivars. That his volume has become an invaluable reference book, the bible for maple growers and enthusiasts worldwide, is a measure of its success in achieving these objectives.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Since the last revision of this work in 2001, communications and the exchange of plants and materials between maple growers worldwide has mushroomed, resulting in almost a doubling of the Japanese maple cultivars now grown and collected by enthusiasts. Hence the time is appropriate for a larger, expanded 4th edition incorporating many of the newer cultivars and any changes in the growing techniques, taxonomy and nomenclature which have occurred in recent years&#x2014;thus making it a more comprehensive up-to-date reference or encyclopedia of Japanese maples. And, as in the previous edition, to avoid endless repetition, cultivars of <i>Acer palmatum</i> are cited without a species name (for example, &#x2018;Red Pygmy&#x2019;), while cultivars of other species are always cited with the appropriate species name (for example, <i>A. japonicum</i> &#x2018;Green Cascade&#x2019;).<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> The introductory chapters remain essentially unchanged, although some topics are given more or less attention to reflect current trends. Chapter 2 places more emphasis on how to avoid and correct illegitimate cultivar names, chapter 3 has an expanded section on growing maples in containers, and chapter 4 moves away from commercial propagation methods toward those for garden and amateur enthusiasts.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Clearly, the main revision occurs in the plant description chapters with the inclusion of more than 100 additional cultivars which have proven their worth or become readily available since 2001. A total of some 420 <i>A. palmatum</i> cultivars are described in chapter 5, while 80 cultivars of other Japanese maple species, including those of <i>A. japonicum</i>, are described in chapter 6. Between them, chapters 5 and 6 cover the majority of the Japanese maples in cultivation. The remaining cultivars are briefly described or listed in appendices C and D. The descriptions of cultivars known in the late 1970s are primarily derived from specimens growing in the Maplewood collections, augmented by written material from early literature. The descriptions of the newer cultivars are based on specimens seen in various collections and nurseries, material received, and information provided by the originators or other knowledgeable collectors and growers. It has been difficult to describe adequately all the subtle differences occurring between cultivars.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> The plant descriptions indicate the likely mature size of a plant grown under normal garden conditions and care. The detailed leaf measurements have been replaced with general terms for size&#x2014;small, medium, large&#x2014;which are more useful to most gardeners. Where it has been possible to accurately determine the meaning of Japanese cultivar names, that information has been added. Since most Japanese maples can grow in normal garden conditions in USDA hardiness zones 5 through 9, that information is omitted from the individual plant descriptions. Plants noted as being &#x201c;tender&#x201d; are only cold-hardy to zone 6. The color illustrations of the foliage were planned to assist in identification and not to present landscape situations. Where practical, an attempt has been made to include photographs which show the plant&#x2019;s main attractive feature, whether spring or autumn color, winter stems, unusual foliage, or so forth.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> The appendices have been updated. An additional appendix includes a list of plant suppliers who stock a good range of Japanese maples. The index, with nearly 2300 plant names, serves as the definitive list of all published Japanese cultivar names. Included in the index are all the Japanese maple cultivar names published in books, journals, and major catalogs of growers, including synonyms, and the names of cultivars no longer in cultivation&#x2014;so that <i>Japanese Maples</i> will continue to be the foremost reference book for this wonderfully versatile collection of ornamental plants.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> This revision could not have been accomplished without the cooperation, help, advice, and encouragement of numerous friends, colleagues, and correspondents. Conscientious attempts have been made to check the correctness of the cultivar names, origins, and descriptions acquired from my own knowledge and experience or from information and material received, to maintain the standards set by J. D. Vertrees. Whenever possible, samples from two or more different sources were compared. Hence, any errors or weaknesses that may have crept in are mine and mine alone.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> It is hoped that these additions and changes will help to foster and strengthen J. D. Vertrees&#x2019; principal aim of introducing stability in the naming of Japanese maple cultivars while, at the same time, preserving his ideas, research, and unique style of writing.</p><h2>The Legacy: The Legend of Drizzt</h2><p>A new mass market edition of the <i>New York Times</i> best-selling sword and sorcery classic, <i>The Legacy</i> is Drizzt at his scimitar-wielding best!<br><br>Having found a measure of peace among the dwarves in the reclaimed Mithral Hall, Drizzt begins to know contentment for perhaps the first time in his tumultuous life.

Ted Williams, Johnny Pesky, and Johnny Sain were among a cadre of fighter-pilot cadets who wore the Cloudbuster Nine baseball jersey at an elite Navy training school at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>As a child, Anne Keene's father, Jim Raugh, suited up as the team bat boy and mascot. He got to know his baseball heroes personally, watching players hit the road on cramped, tin-can buses, dazzling factory workers, kids, and service members at dozens of games, including a war-bond exhibition with Babe Ruth at Yankee Stadium.<br>Jimmy followed his baseball dreams as a college All-American but was crushed later in life by a failed major-league bid with the Detroit Tigers. He would have carried this story to his grave had Anne not discovered his scrapbook from a Navy school that shaped America's greatest heroes including George H.W. Bush, Gerald Ford, John Glenn, and Paul "Bear" Bryant.<br><br>With the help of rare images and insights from World War II baseball veterans such as Yankees legends Dr. Bobby Brown and Eddie Robinson, the story of this remarkable team is brought to life for the first time in <i>The Cloudbuster Nine: The Untold Story of Ted Williams and the Baseball Team That Helped Win World War II.</i></p><p><b>Anne R.

However, many Christians are often disgusted by the barbarity and violence, put off by the emphasis on honor and man-centered glory, and simply baffled by the long and tedious descriptions of battle scenes and elaborate ceremonies. <p></p><p>In this book written for high school students, Leithart gives a patient, yet critical examination of some of the greatest classics of ancient literature, including Hesiod's <i>Theogony</i>, Homer's <i>Iliad</i> and <i>Odyssey</i>, Aechylus' <i>Eumenides</i>, Sophocles' <i>Oedipus Tyrannus</i>, Euripdes' <i>The Bacchae</i>, Aristophanes' <i>The Birds</i>, and Virgil's <i>Aeneid</i>. While Leithart expounds the deep and interesting symbolism, tropes, and deeper meanings of these classics, he never forgets the theological themes. The pagans were very concerned with salvation, but it was a salvation that depended above all on man, and thus there was a gaping hole that only the gospel could really fill. </p><p></p><p>This book is perfect for high school students and includes numerous review and discussion questions for curricular use.</p></p><p>Peter J. Leithart (PhD, Cambridge) is President of Theopolis Institute in Birmingham, Albama and an Adjunct Senior Fellow at New Saint Andrews College in Moscow, Idaho. He is the author of numerous books on theology and literature, including <i>The Baptized Body, Against Christianity, Brightest Heaven of Invention,</i> and <i>Ascent to Love.</i> He has also authored articles in journals such as <i>Pro Ecclesia, Journal of Biblical Literature, Westminster Theological Journal,</i> and <i>First Things.</i> Peter and his wife Noel have ten children and a fetching collection of grandchildren.Leithart doesn't simply discuss the intricacies of the texts; he goes further and allows unique biblical insight to illuminate the conflict between the heroes of the city of man and the city of God. The most obvious virtue of Leithart's book is its scope. In a single volume he provides a defense for the value of reading classical literature, a methodology for integrating that literature with the Christian faith, and a reader's guide to the works of classical literature that a contemporary reader would most benefit from reading. ---Leland Ryken, Wheaton College<br><br>With verve and cunning, Leithart centers the reader in a sound theology of story before equipping him to engage ancient texts like <i>The Iliad</i> with profound Biblical and literary insight. ---Bruce L.

Drawing on previously unseen papers and new scholarly research, Ullrich charts Hitler's life from his childhood through his experiences in the First World War and his subsequent rise as a far-right leader. Focusing on the personality behind the policies, Ullrich creates a vivid portrait of a man and his megalomania, political skill, and horrifying worldview. Hitler is a landmark biography with unsettling resonance in these times.</p><p><b>VOLKER ULLRICH</b> is a historian and journalist whose previous books in German include biographies of Bismarck and Napoleon, as well as a major study of Imperial Germany, <i>Die nerv�se Grossmacht 1871&#x2013;1918</i> (The Nervous Superpower). From 1990 to 2009, Ullrich was the editor of the political book review section of the influential weekly newspaper <i>Die Zeit</i>.HITLER by Volker Ullrich<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Hitler As Human Being&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Excerpt (pgs. 382-386)</b><br> As a rule, people who got a close look at the F�hrer for the first time were rarely impressed. After a meeting with Hitler in December 1931, the industrialist G�nther Quandt deemed him the very definition of average. Sefton Delmer described him as an everyday person remi�niscent of a travelling salesman or a junior officer. As we saw, the American reporter Dorothy Thompson called Hitler the exact proto�type of the little man on the street. William Shirer, the correspondent for America&#x2019;s Universal News Service, also came away disappointed after seeing Hitler in September 1934 at the Nuremberg rally. &#x201c;His face,&#x201d; Shirer wrote in his diary, &#x201c;had no particular expression at all&#x2014;I expected it to be stronger&#x2014;and for the life of me I could not quite comprehend what hidden springs he undoubtedly unloosened in the hysterical mob which was greeting him so wildly.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>Hitler&#x2019;s appearance was hardly winning. Finance Minister von Krosigk, who met Hitler for the first time when the new chancellor was sworn in on 30 January 1933, recalled the F�hrer&#x2019;s face as being unremarkable. &#x201c;There was nothing harmonious about his features, nor did they have the irregularity that expresses individual human spirit,&#x201d; Krosigk wrote. &#x201c;A lock of hair that flopped down over his forehead and the rudiments of a moustache only two fingers wide gave his appearance something comic.&#x201d; &nbsp;Hitler&#x2019;s moustache was the feature that everyone noticed. Early on, Hanfstaengl had urged him to shave it off, arguing that it was fodder for caricaturists. &#x201c;My moustache will be all the rage one day&#x2014;you can bet on that,&#x201d; Hitler replied. Around 1925 or 1926 he told Adelheid Klein, a friend in Munich: &#x201c;Imagine my face without the moustache! . . . My nose is much too big. I have to soften it with the moustache!&#x201d; &nbsp;Indeed, Hitler&#x2019;s large, fleshy nose was rather disproportionate to the rest of his face. Klaus Mann called it the &#x201c;most foul and most charac�teristic&#x201d; aspect of Hitler&#x2019;s physiognomy. &nbsp;For his part Albert Speer claimed that he only noticed how ugly and disproportionate Hitler&#x2019;s face was in the final months of the Third Reich, when the F�hrer&#x2019;s appeal was declining. &#x201c;How did I not notice that in all the years?&#x201d; he wondered in his Spandau prison cell in late November 1946. &#x201c;Curious!&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>Almost everyone who came into contact with Hitler was struck by another feature. Upon seeing the young Hitler for the first time in 1919, Karl Alexander von M�ller immediately noted his &#x201c;large, light-blue, fanatically and coldly gleaming eyes.&#x201d; &nbsp;Lieselotte Schmidt, an assistant and nanny to Winifred Wagner, had a different impression. Like her mistress, she admired Hitler and found that his eyes shone with goodness and warmth. &#x201c;One glance from his lovely violet-blue eyes was enough to sense his gentle temperament and good heart,&#x201d; Schmidt said in 1929. Otto Wagener, the economic adviser who entered Hitler&#x2019;s service that same year and still professed his admiration of the F�hrer in a British POW camp in 1946, recalled: <br><br>From the first moment, his eyes captivated me. They were clear and large and calm. He stared at me full of self-confidence. But his gaze did not come from his eyeballs. On the contrary, I felt it came from somewhere far deeper, from infinity. You could read nothing in his eyes. But they spoke and wanted to say something.&nbsp;<br><br>Christa Schroeder, one of Hitler&#x2019;s secretaries from 1933 onwards, was somewhat more sober: &#x201c;I found Hitler&#x2019;s eyes very expressive. They looked interested and probing and always became more animated whenever he spoke.&#x201d; &nbsp;The playwright Gerhart Hauptmann also noted Hitler&#x2019;s &#x201c;strange and lovely eyes&#x201d; after meeting the F�hrer at the inauguration of the Reich Culture Chamber in November 1933.&nbsp;<br><br>Whether people perceived Hitler&#x2019;s gaze as cold or benevolent, impenetrable or friendly and inquisitive depended both on the given situation and their political views. &#x201c;What admirers praise as the power of his eyes strikes neutral observers as a greedy stare without that hint of decency that makes a gaze truly compelling,&#x201d; wrote the Hitler detractor Konrad Heiden. &#x201c;His gaze repels more than it captivates.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>But even critical observers sometimes praised his eyes. &#x201c;Hitler&#x2019;s eyes were startling and unforgettable,&#x201d; wrote Martha Dodd, the daughter of the U.S. ambassador to Germany, William Edward Dodd, after being introduced to Hitler by Hanfstaengl in 1933. &#x201c;They seemed pale blue in colour, were intense, unwavering, hypnotic.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>Alongside his eyes, Hitler&#x2019;s hands attracted the most attention. &#x201c;So expressive in their movements as to compete with the eyes&#x201d; was how Houston Stewart Chamberlain put it in a fawning letter to Hitler in 1923. For Krosigk, Hitler&#x2019;s hands were nervous, delicate and &#x201c;almost feminine.&#x201d; In 1933, when the philosopher Karl Jaspers voiced doubts as to whether someone as uneducated as Hitler could lead Germany, his colleague Martin Heidegger replied: &#x201c;Education is irrelevant . . . just look at those lovely hands.&#x201d; Many of Heidegger&#x2019;s contemporaries shared his admiration for the F�hrer&#x2019;s hands. In an article for the December 1936 edition of <i>New Literature</i>, the head of German radio characterised Hitler&#x2019;s delicate hands as being the tools of an &#x201c;artist and great creator.&#x201d; And in October 1942, while imprisoned in a British POW camp, General Ludwig Cr�well opined: &#x201c;His hands are truly striking&#x2014;lovely hands . . . He&#x2019;s got the hands of an artist. My eyes were always drawn to his hands.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> But more impressive than his eyes and hands was Hitler&#x2019;s talent for speaking. His appearance may have made him seem average and everyday, but as soon as he took to the stage, he was transformed into a demagogue the likes of which Germany had never known. Admirers and detractors were in absolute agreement on this point. In his essay &#x201c;Brother Hitler,&#x201d; Thomas Mann attributed Hitler&#x2019;s rise to his &#x201c;eloquence, which although unspeakably base, has huge sway over the masses.&#x201d; &nbsp;Heiden wrote of &#x201c;an incomparable barometer of mass moods,&#x201d; while Otto Strasser spoke of an &#x201c;unusually sensitive seismograph of the soul.&#x201d; Strasser also compared Hitler to a &#x201c;membrane&#x201d; broadcasting the most secret longings and emotions of the masses. &nbsp;Krosigk concurred. &#x201c;He sensed what the masses were longing for and translated it into firebrand slogans,&#x201d; the Reich finance minister wrote. &#x201c;He appealed to the instincts slumbering in people&#x2019;s unconsciousness and offered something to everyone.&#x201d; &nbsp;The American journalist Hubert R. Knickerbocker, who had encountered Hitler as a seemingly polite, small-time politician in the NSDAP&#x2019;s Munich headquarters in 1931, was astonished by a public appearance that same evening. &#x201c;He was an evangelist speaking at a tent meeting, the Billy Sunday of German politics,&#x201d; the Pulitzer Prize winner wrote. &#x201c;Those he had converted followed him, laughed with him, felt with him. Together they mocked the French. Together they hissed off the Republic. Eight thousand people became one instrument on which Hitler played his symphony of national passion.&#x201d; As Knickerbocker realised, the secret to Hitler&#x2019;s success lay in the mutual identification between speaker and audience&#x2014;in the exchange of indi�vidual and collective sensitivities and neuroses.<br><br>It was not only the faithful whom Hitler managed to put under his spell. &#x201c;There won&#x2019;t be anyone like him for quite some time,&#x201d; Rudolf Hess wrote in 1924 while imprisoned in Landsberg, &#x201c;a man who can sweep away both the most left-wing lathe operator and the right-wing government official in a single mass event.&#x201d; Hess&#x2019;s view was no exag�geration. Numerous contemporaries who rejected Hitler and his party struggled to resist the lure of Hitler&#x2019;s overwhelming rhetoric&#x2014;indeed, some succumbed to it. In his memoirs, the historian Golo Mann described the impression a Hitler speech made on him as a 19-year-old student in the autumn of 1928. &#x201c;I had to steel myself against the energy and persuasive force of the speaker,&#x201d; Mann wrote. &#x201c;A Jewish friend of mine, whom I had brought along, was unable to resist. &#x2018;He&#x2019;s right,&#x2019; he whispered in my ear. How many times had I heard this phrase &#x2018;He&#x2019;s right&#x2019; uttered by listeners from whom I would have least expected it?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>Hitler&#x2019;s talent for persuasive oration gave him a hypnotic sway over crowds. Part of his secret was his unusually powerful and variable voice. &#x201c;Those who only know Hitler from the events of later years, after he had mutated into an immoderately thundering dictator and demagogue at the microphone, have no idea what a flexible and mellif�luous instrument his natural, non-amplified voice was in the early years of his political career,&#x201d; noted Hanfstaengl. It was Hitler&#x2019;s voice, at a speech in Weimar in March 1925, that won over Baldur von Schirach, later the Nazis&#x2019; Reich youth leader, at the age of 18. &#x201c;It was a voice unlike any other I had heard from a public speaker,&#x201d; Schirach recalled. &#x201c;It was deep and rough, resonant as a cello. His accent, which we thought was Austrian but was actually Lower Bavarian, was alien to central Germany and compelled you to listen.&#x201d; &nbsp;he called himself the greatest actor in Europe,&#x201d; Krosigk recalled. That statement was one of the excessive flights of fancy to which the dictator became increasingly prone in his later years. Nonetheless, Hitler had an undeniable ability to don different masks to suit various occasions and to inhabit changing roles. &#x201c;He could be a charming conversation partner who kissed women&#x2019;s hands, a friendly uncle who gave children chocolate, or a man of the people who could shake the callused hands of farmers and artisans,&#x201d; remarked Albert Krebs, the Gauleiter of Hamburg. When invited to the Bechstein and Bruckmann salons or to afternoon tea at the Schirachs&#x2019; in Weimar, he would play the upstanding, suit-and-tie-wearing bourgeois to fit in with such social settings. At NSDAP party conferences, he dressed in a brown shirt and cast himself as a prototypical street fighter who made no secret of his contempt for polite society.<br><br>Hitler adapted his speeches to people&#x2019;s expectations. In front of the Reichstag, he talked like a wise statesman. When he spoke to a circle of industrialists he was a man of moderation. To women he was the good-humoured father who loved children, while in front of large crowds he was a fiery volcano. To his fellow party members he was the truest and bravest soldier who sacrificed himself and was therefore allowed to demand sacrifices of others. Andr� Fran�ois-Poncet, who witnessed Hitler&#x2019;s various appearances at the Nuremberg rally in 1935, was impressed by the F�hrer&#x2019;s ability to intuit the mood of each given audience. &#x201c;He found the words and tone he needed for all of them,&#x201d; the French ambassador remarked. &#x201c;He ran the gamut from biting to melodramatic to intimate and lordly.&#x201d; The man who succeeded Fran�ois-Poncet in 1938, Robert Coulondre, was also surprised by the man he met at the Berghof retreat when he presented his letter of credence in November. &#x201c;I was expecting a thundering Jove in his castle and what I got was a simple, gentle, possibly shy man in his country home,&#x201d; Coulondre reported. &#x201c;I had heard the rough, screaming, threatening and demanding voice of the F�hrer on the radio. Now I became acquainted with a Hitler who had a warm, calm, friendly and understanding voice. Which one is the true Hitler? Or are they both true?&#x201d;</p><h2>The Worst Journey in the World (Penguin Classics)</h2><p><b>A firsthand account of Scott's disastrous Antarctic expedition</b><br><br><i>The Worst Journey in the World</i> recounts Robert Falcon Scott&#x2019;s ill-fated expedition to the South Pole.

This is his gripping account of an expedition gone disastrously wrong. <br>One of the youngest members of Scott's team, the author was later part of the rescue party that eventually found the frozen bodies of Scott and three men who had accompanied him on the final push to the Pole. Prior to this sad denouement, Cherry-Garrard's account is filled with details of scientific discovery and anecdotes of human resilience in a harsh environment, supported by diary excerpts and accounts from other explorers. <br>Summing up the reasons for writing the book, Cherry-Garrard says: <br>"To me, and perhaps to you, the interest in this story is the men, and it is the spirit of the men, "the response of the spirit," which is interesting rather than what they did or failed to do: except in a superficial sense, they never failed... It is a story about human minds with all kinds of ideas and questions involved, which stretch beyond the furthest horizons."<b>Apsley Cherry-Garrard</b> (1886-1959) was one of the youngest members of Captain Scott's final expedition to the Antarctic which he joined to collect the eggs of the Emperor penguin.

Starting with the surprisingly effective relationship of Harry S. Truman and Herbert Hoover, and following through "Obama and His Club," <em>TIME Magazine</em>'s Executive Editor Nancy Gibbs and Washington Bureau Chief Michael Duffy trace the surprising, complicated story of "the world's most exclusive fraternity." Sitting presidents and their predecessors have at times proved remarkably simpatico, at others impossible thorns in each other's sides. The authors' extensive research demonstrates that ex-Presidents have a penchant for morphing from consummate team players into irascible rogues, sometimes within weeks, as they strive both to remain relevant and to shape their own legacies.

Steward founded his company, Worldwide Technology, Inc., on a shoestring budget and borrowed money, well aware of the high-risk nature of the venture he was undertaking. Despite the fact that he was a novice entrepreneur, he was certain he would succeed. Steward believed intensely that God wouldn't let him down.<br><br> <em>Doing Business by the Good Book</em> shares the inspiring lessons culled straight from the Bible, that Steward used to build his privately held billion-dollar company into a global information technology enterprise.</p><p>Dennis O&#39;Neil began his career as a comic-book writer in 1965 at Charlton, where then-editor Dick Giordano assigned him to several features. When Giordano moved to DC, O&#39;Neil soon followed. At DC, O&#39;Neil scripted several series for Giordano and Julius Schwartz, quickly becoming one of the most respected writers in comics. O&#39;Neil earned a reputation for being able to &#34;revamp&#34; such characters as Superman, Green Lantern, Captain Marvel -- and Batman, whom O&#39;Neil (with the help of Neal Adams and Giordano) brought back to his roots as a dark, mysterious, gothic avenger. Besides being the most important Batman writer of the 1970s, O&#39;Neil served as an editor at both Marvel and DC. After a long tenure as Group Editor of the Batman line of titles, he retired to write full-time.Jesus' teachings were not meant to be spoken only on Sunday, writes Steward, CEO of World Wide Technology Inc., the world's largest African-American-owned company. Rather, those teachings were meant to be implemented everywhere, including the workplace. In this book, Steward shares 52 biblical principles in short, easy-to-read chapters that can be digested once a week for a full year or devoured in one sitting. Steward draws heavily on his own knowledge of building a high-tech company from the ground up, and also his corporate experiences at FedEx and Union Pacific. He has a real knack for helping readers see how biblical principles relate to those experiences and to contemporary business issues. Even the trendy notion of "branding" is placed thoughtfully with a relevant Scripture (Matthew 12:33: "Either make the tree good, and its fruit good, or make the tree bad, and its fruit bad; for the tree is known by its fruit."). Christian businesspeople who want a solid introduction to biblical ethics in the workplace will particularly enjoy his fine chapters on accountability, enthusiasm, customer satisfaction and networking. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In 1927, Ren� Gu�non responded to this crisis with the closest thing he ever wrote to a manifesto and &#39;call-to-action&#39;. The Crisis of the Modern World was his most direct and complete application of traditional metaphysical principles-particularly that of the &#39;age of darkness&#39; preceding the end of the present world-to social criticism, surpassed only by The Reign of Quantity and the Signs of the Times, his magnum opus. In the present work Gu�non ruthlessly exposes the &#39;Western deviation&#39;: its loss of tradition, its exaltation of action over knowledge, its rampant individualism and general social chaos. His response to these conditions was not &#39;activist&#39;, however, but purely intellectual, envisioning the coming together of Western intellectual leaders capable under favorable circumstances of returning the West to its traditional roots, most likely via the Catholic Church, or, under less favorable ones, of at least preserving the &#39;seeds&#39; of Tradition for the time to come.</p><p>Ren� Gu�non (1886&#x2013;1951) was one of the great luminaries of the twentieth century, whose critique of the modern world has stood fast against the shifting sands of intellectual fashion. His extensive writings, now finally available in English, are a providential treasure-trove for the modern seeker: while pointing ceaselessly to the perennial wisdom found in past cultures ranging from the Shamanistic to the Indian and Chinese, the Hellenic and Judaic, the Christian and Islamic, and including also Alchemy, Hermeticism, and other esoteric currents, they direct the reader also to the deepest level of religious praxis, emphasizing the need for affiliation with a revealed tradition even while acknowledging the final identity of all spiritual paths as they approach the summit of spiritual realization. Ren� Gu�non, of whom Jacob Needleman wrote in The Sword of Gnosis that &#x2018;no other modern writer has so effectively communicated the absoluteness of truth,&#x2019; is gradually being recognized by deeper thinkers as one of the few who have truly penetrated the seductive veil of the modern age. As an expositor of pure metaphysics and its application to the science of symbols, Gu�non is without peer; and his extraordinarily prescient critique of the modern world is attracting more and more attention among cultural commentators. Little known in the English-speaking world till the recent appearance of his Collected Works in translation, Gu�non has nevertheless long been recognized as a veritable criterion of truth by a vanguard of remarkable writers who evince that rare combination: intellectuality and spirituality. After a lonely childhood, often interrupted by ill health, Gu�non navigated the seductive half-truths of occultism toward a deeper, unified vision offering a way out from the confusion and fragmentation of our time. Regarded by leading scholars as the first truly authentic interpreter of many Eastern doctrines in the West, Gu�non never tired, in face of the seemingly inexorable process of dissolution in the twentieth century, of pointing to the transcendent unity of all religious faiths and the abiding Truth that contains them all.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: French</p><h2>The Golden Egg Book (Little Golden Board Books)</h2><p>"The Easter classic about a bunny and beautiful egg, is now available as a brightly colored board book.

The place was an ordinary farmhouse in America&#x2019;s heartland, filled with extraordinary evidence of unthinkable depravity. The man behind the massacre was a slight, unassuming Midwesterner with a strange smile&#x2014;and even stranger attachment to his domineering mother. After her death and a failed attempt to dig up his mother&#x2019;s body from the local cemetery, Gein turned to other grave robberies and, ultimately, multiple murders. Driven to commit gruesome and bizarre acts beyond all imagining, Ed Gein remains one of the most deranged minds in the annals of American homicide. This is his story&#x2014;recounted in fascinating and chilling detail by Harold Schechter, one of the most acclaimed true-crime storytellers of our time.</p><p>Harold Schechter is a historian: he takes old files and yellowed newspaper clippings, and brings their stories to life. <i>Deviant</i> is about everyone's favorite ghoul, Ed Gein--whose crimes inspired the writers of <i>Psycho</i>, <i>Texas Chainsaw Massacre</i>, and <i>The Silence of the Lambs</i>. Schechter deftly evokes the small-town 1950s Wisconsin setting--not pretty farms and cheese factories, but infertile soil and a bleak, hardscrabble existence. The details of Gein's "death house" are perhaps well known by now, but the murderer's quietly crazy, almost gentle personality comes forth in this book as never before. As Gary Kadet wrote, in <i>The Boston Book Review</i>, "Schechter is a dogged researcher [who backs up] every bizarre detail and curious twist in this and his other books ... More importantly, he nimbly avoids miring his writing and our reading with minutiae or researched overstatement, which means that although he can occasionally be dry, he is never boring." <br> Also recommended: Schechter's books about Albert Fish (<i>Deranged</i>) and Herman Mudgett a.k.a.

At a tender age, she becomes convinced that she will never find true love, instead believing that "love is a terrible thing that will make you suffer. . . ." A chance meeting in Rio takes her to Geneva, where she dreams of finding fame and fortune. Maria's despairing view of love is put to the test when she meets a handsome young painter. In this odyssey of self-discovery, Maria has to choose between pursuing a path of darkness - sexual pleasure for its own sake - or risking everything to find her own "inner light" and the possibility of sacred sex, sex in the context of love. </p> <p> This P.S. edition features an extra 16 pages of insights into the book, including author interviews, recommended reading, and more. </p></p><p><p>Paulo Coelho, born in Rio de Janeiro in 1947, is one of the bestselling and most influential authors in the world. <em>The Alchemist</em>, <em>The Pilgrimage</em>, <em>The Valkyries, Brida</em>, <em>Veronika Decides to Die</em>, <em>Eleven Minutes</em>, <em>The Zahir</em>, <em>The Witch of Portobello</em>, <em>The Winner Stands Alone</em>, <em>Aleph</em>, <em>Manuscript Found in Accra</em>, and <em>Adultery</em>, among others, have sold over 175 million copies worldwide, and <em>The Alchemist</em> has been on the <em>New York Times</em> bestseller list for over 360 weeks.</p><p>Paulo Coelho has been a member of the Brazilian Academy of Letters since 2002, and in 2007, he was appointed United Nations Messenger of Peace. He is also the most followed author on social media.</p><p> Sacred sex. A paradoxical, utopian impossibility or a life- sustaining, attainable goal? This is the major question that underpins Paulo Coelho's new novel, Eleven Minutes, the tale of Maria, a naive young woman from Brazil who becomes a high-class prostitute in Switzerland. (The title of the book refers to the hypothetical average duration for an act of coitus.) And while Coelho comes down firmly in the end for the reality of a holy carnality, the path he takes to that affirmation acknowledges completely the snares and labyrinths awaiting any explorer of the fusion of body and soul.</p><p>The novel opens with a rather striking sentence: "Once upon a time, there was a prostitute called Maria." Unfortunately, Coelho then feels the immediate need to break the fourth wall and address the reader about the propriety of yoking fairy-tale beginnings with the subject matter of profane love. One braces oneself for a continually intrusive authorial presence, consonant with Coelho's extra-literary reputation as a guru and New Age spokesperson, in the grand manner of Khalil Gibran. Much to Coelho's credit, however, this initial intrusion is anomalous. The rest of the narrative embeds itself firmly in Maria's perceptions and experiences, her emotions, dreams and struggles to understand life. By the end of the book, she fully owns her story, Coelho's talent and restraint having elevated her from the status of mere mouthpiece and symbol to that of uniquely individuated life force.</p><p>We meet Maria when she is still a young girl living in Brazil's unsophisticated interior. Maria's girlhood experiments with romance convince her that love is a delusion, or at least it is not for her. Attaining her majority, she becomes a shopgirl with limited prospects. But a vacation to Rio brings her into contact with a Swiss tourist looking to hire dancers for his club in Geneva. Here Coelho is delightfully ambiguous, letting us believe that Roger, the Swiss, may be a white slaver. But, no, he really does run a dance club, and Maria is soon hoofing it in Geneva. But after falling out with Roger, she drifts on her own initiative into life as a bar-girl. Quickly adapting to the coarse but not uninteresting role of prostitute, she endures nearly a year of service, until she has accumulated enough money to return to Brazil in style. At that point she meets a young artist, Ralf Hart, and begins to fall in love, disturbing her hard-won equilibrium and raising the issue of whether the two halves of her nature can be satisfied by any one man.</p><p>Coelho's prose -- at least in the fluid English translation by Margaret Jull Costa -- is limpid and unadorned, as easy to assimilate as water. (Of course, sometimes one wants wine instead, and Coelho's prose will not deliver such a kick.) This unornate language stands Coelho in good stead during the scenes of actual sex, of which there are surprisingly few, compared to the scenes of Maria thinking about sex and its mysteries. These explicit passages, especially the long-denied consummation between Ralf and Maria, are gratifyingly erotic and will not be earning Coelho any nominations for the Guardian's Bad Sex writing awards.</p><p>Coelho has spoken in interviews about producing manuscripts that are several times longer than the work ultimately published, and then stripping away everything viewed as extraneous. This practice results in books that read more as allegories than grittily mimetic renderings of life. (Contrast this book with William Vollman's similarly themed The Royal Family.) None of the characters other than Maria and, to some extent, Ralf (who, in light of his parallel worldly successes and troubles with wives, may be an avatar of Coelho himself), is any deeper than his functionality demands. For instance, Maria's best friend in Geneva is a female librarian known as "the librarian." Her main role is to deliver a lecture on clitoral orgasms. Likewise, Coelho sketches in the settings just enough to serve as backdrops to Maria's quest.</p><p>It can easily be argued that Coelho's first smash hit, The Alchemist (1993), set the template for Maria's story. The shepherd in that earlier novel is bent on living out his "Personal Legend" through a voyage of self-exploration, as is Maria. Both decry the failure to dream and the impossibility of living the dreams of others. The two characters even buck themselves up in near-identical terms. The shepherd: "He had to choose between thinking of himself as the poor victim of a thief and as an adventurer in search of his treasure." Maria: "I can choose either to be a victim of the world or an adventurer in search of treasure." Why, it turns out that Maria has even read a copy of what can only be The Alchemist! But while The Alchemist was almost asexual in its romance, this novel revels in the physicality of love and thus serves to complement the earlier book.</p><p>At times Maria's sacrifices on the altar of sex almost resemble the excruciations of the heroine of Lars von Trier's film "Breaking the Waves." But Coelho's basically optimistic and life-affirming temperament and his sense of humor (Maria's reaction to the librarian's sexually empowering lecture amounts to wishing the woman would just shut up) redeem the book from any such Nordic angst. By the time the fairy tale ending arrives, we feel that Maria has earned her rewards. And, per Coelho's mission, we are inspired to feel that so might we. </p><p></p><p>Reviewed by Paul Di Filippo</p><p></p><p><br>Copyright 2004, The Washington Post Co.

The crossing of the Rubicon was momentous because the river demarcated the boundary between Italy and the province of Gaul to the north, where Caesar was serving as governor. Suspicious of his growing power, the Senate had ordered him to disband his army and return to Rome. But Caesar, defying the Senate, decided to return not in submission but in rebellion, marching on Rome with his legion. By crossing into Italian territory with an army, Caesar had irrevocably made himself a traitor.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For all it's, Caesar's river crossing was a relatively modest affair in which the future ruler and his legionnaires merely waded across a shin-deep stream. Nonetheless, this act put him in irreconcilable opposition to Rome's Senate, making the expression "crossing the Rubicon" forever synonymous with passing a point of no return.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The story about how Caesar and his legion marched on Rome survived on the parchment of the Lives, a series of profiles of famous men recorded by the Greek biographer Plutarch. Plutarch also recorded that the Senate-five years later-"in the hope that the government of a single person would give them time to breathe after so many civil wars and calamities," made Caesar "dictator for life." And yet within two months he was assassinated, the knives wielded by many of those same senators. As Plutarch explains, Caesar's "pretension" and the "extravagance" of his new title had motivated the group, including Caesar's close friend Marcus Junius Brutus, to conspire against him.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Today, those of us who know Julius Caesar's story most likely learned it not from reading Plutarch, but from Shakespeare's Julius Caesar. In the bard's telling of the assassination, Caesar struggles until he sees Brutus among the attackers and realizes the depth of his betrayal. Famously, his dying utterance is the poignant "Et tu, Brute? Then fall, Caesar!"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Almost two millennia later, another General would become famous by crossing a river. Unlike the modest Rubicon, the Delaware could not be crossed by wading, so George Washington had no choice but to cross by boat, a scene memorialized in Washington Crossing the Delaware, one of America�s most recognizable paintings. On a canvas measuring over twenty-one feet wide, Emanuel Leutze captured the daring of America�s founding father and first president.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The parallels between Caesar and Washington go beyond the rivers they crossed as generals. Just as Caesar's final phase of leadership was reenacted by Shakespeare through the rhythm of iambic pentameter, the final act of Washington's leadership was depicted by the playwright Lin-Manuel Miranda, who four centuries later chose hip-hop as the rhythm to dramatize Washington's retirement in his theatrical story of Alexander Hamilton. And where Shakespeare had turned to Plutarch's Lives, Miranda found his inspiration within the pages of Ron Chernow's biography Alexander Hamilton.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The musical closes with the rap song "One Last Time," in which George Washington's 1796 decision to step down after his second term is met by a disbelieving Hamilton:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Hamilton: Why do you have to say goodbye?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Washington: If I say goodbye, the nation learns to move on.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It outlives me when I'm gone.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Miranda said later that he sought to celebrate Washington's "humanity" and "frailty," lifting up the rare example of a leader who voluntarily relinquishes power. In the playwright's drama, Washington selflessly prioritizes the fledgling nation's democracy over the pursuit of power, consistent with the founding father's legacy of leadership.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For would-be leaders, the oft-told stories of audacious river crossings and of the dramatic finales of Julius Caesar and George Washington are both inspiring and intimidating. The stories would be more helpful, though, if leadership actually worked the way the legends imply. In fact, for both Caesar and Washington, leadership was hardly so simple.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>History codified Caesar's "The die is cast" as a declaration of courage and decisiveness, but the proclamation also marked a moment of profound doubt. Plutarch tells us, but popular history forgets, that Caesar "ordered a halt" when he approached the river, and that he "wavered much in his mind . . . and often changed his opinion one way and the other." Before pressing on, he sought counsel when "his purposes fluctuated most." And yet "halting," "wavering," and "fluctuating" are not how we tend to view leaders, nor how leaders seek to be remembered. Truly effective leaders, we like to believe, are not susceptible to the fog of doubt-they act decisively and face the consequences. But few real leaders have actually operated this way.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, too, Caesar's dying words, "Et tu, Brute?" were likely dramatic license taken by Shakespeare and other Elizabethan playwrights. Plutarch's version of the assassination itself was the stuff of a very different drama.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When he is first attacked, rather than make an exclamation that might endear him to history, Caesar, more naturally, grabbed the offending dagger and tried to stop himself from being stabbed. Instead of calling to Brutus, he exclaims, "Vile Casca, what does this mean?" The rest of the struggle is an awkward affair, the great Caesar writhing to avoid the blows of his attackers, who in their own bungling efforts end up stabbing one another: "Some say that he fought and resisted all the rest, shifting his body to avoid the blows, and calling out for help, but that when he saw Brutus's sword drawn, he covered his face with his robe and submitted. . . . And the conspirators themselves were many of them wounded by each other, whilst they all levelled their blows at the same person."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Where Shakespeare's play focuses on the tension and conflict between two of his play's main characters, Plutarch's account zeroes in on Caesar's behavior in the course of dying a violent death.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In truth, neither Plutarch nor Shakespeare knew exactly what happened, and neither do we. We have no choice but to interpret events through the words they've given us. Both the biographer and the playwright do their best to capture the complexity in their own way. Alas, what we remember selectively is that Caesar crossed the Rubicon boldly and then died while uttering the three famous words that he probably never said.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Looking at the biographer�s and playwright�s versions of history side by side, we see that Caesar�s leadership was not as heroic as it�s often remembered. So too was the case with Washington.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Inside the West Wing lobby of the White House hangs a reproduction of Leutze's Washington Crossing the Delaware. The painting is a favorite stop for White House staffers giving tours to guests, who are entertained with a catalog of the painting's historical flaws: the Delaware River never froze in this way, the river is far too wide, the boat is heading the wrong way, the flag is wrong for the period, and so on. But the most interesting factual flaw is the boat itself. Rather than the rickety whaling rowboat depicted by Leutze, Washington is believed to have used a sixty-foot flat-bottom barge complete with artillery, a far better option for an army conducting a winter's night river crossing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In 2011, a radically different depiction of the crossing was unveiled at the New-York Historical Society, complete with the flat-bottom barge. Artist Mort K&#x178;nstler had been commissioned by a Mr. Thomas R. Suozzi, who told him, "I want to go up against the existing painting. The other painting is great, but it doesn't tell the realistic story." Aside from the boat, the most striking difference between the Leutze and K&#x178;nstler versions is Washington himself. In the original, the General is fully upright in the tiny boat, seemingly lunging forward, his center of gravity elevated and perched over a miniature iceberg. In the remake, he's still standing, but he's carefully balanced, his right hand holding a firm grip on a nearby cannon to steady himself.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>K&#x178;nstler's work corrected inaccuracies of history, while also fixing a critical flaw in how we often depict the practice of leadership. It is, of course, human nature to steady oneself in a boat at night, for human balance is imperfect. Few real leaders, even military generals, present themselves riskily in a rowboat, refusing support, as if posing for posterity. And yet observers rarely see the depiction of Washington towering above a small boat in a freezing body of water-at night-as peculiar. Instead, we often accept such absurdly displayed feats of heroic leadership as normal.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Miranda's depiction of Washington as the American founder too selfless to accept a crown was similarly skewed, and there was more to the idealized story. As Chernow explains, by the time of his resignation, Washington "was suffering from an aching back, bad dentures, and rheumatism; visitors noted his haggard, careworn look." America's founding father was, after all, still human. Washington was certainly motivated by the principle of civic rule-but he was also physically and mentally tired.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A quick scan of these various accounts of two leaders tells us as much about methods of storytelling as about the leaders themselves. Biographers typically tell the stories of individual leaders, emphasizing the significance of their decision making. Unsurprisingly, leaders who draw most of their leadership ideas from biographies learn to adjust their own narrative frames to keep themselves at the center. The stories they tell themselves and others are misleading in a way that we humans crave in a complex world; biography simplifies the complexity of collective human systems down to more manageable individual elements.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The playwright often has a different perspective, focusing on the relationships among individuals, particularly when those relationships contain conflict or comedy. While the biographer helps the reader to know the attributes of the leader, the playwright gets the theatergoer to experience the drama of relationships enveloping that leader.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In truth, we crave both the biographer and the playwright. As individuals we appreciate the biographer's focus on the actors, and as social animals we enjoy the playwright's dramatic depiction of their relationships. Yet both storytellers have contributed to the mythology of leadership. Where the biographer fuels our leader-centrism, the playwright (or the painter) enables leader romanticism. Between the two effects, we devise narratives that obscure the role of followers and wrongly attribute complex outcomes to mere individuals: Caesar's strength both defined and ended his empire, and Washington won the Revolutionary War and founded the United States.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In reality, the lessons of leadership are not the ones we most naturally derive from the legends. The Rubicon reminds us that real leaders experience doubt and consult with others. Similarly, the lesson of the Delaware is not that good leaders are blas in taking on unnecessary risk. A real leader might not utter a pithy line upon being stabbed; he might just quietly die of internal bleeding. When a real leader relinquishes power, he might be upholding the principles of democracy, or he might also simply be fatigued.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>�Leadership� is a famously difficult term to define. As The Bass Handbook of Leadership observes, �often, a two-day meeting to discuss leadership has started with a day of argument over the definition.� Bass also notes that leadership expert Joseph Rost found 221 definitions of leadership in 587 examined publications.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, few leaders are so concerned with quibbling over definitions. In our experience, most people think of leadership as the process of influencing a group toward some defined outcome. This definition suggests that leadership is the process of one person herding the group toward goals, and that leaders at the top craft and direct those endpoints. Perhaps worse, our quest to understand leadership has followed a consistent but always insufficient pattern: we've studied individual leaders and come to think of leadership as simply what leaders do.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Here lies the root cause of the mythology of leadership-its relentless focus on the leader. For years, human beings have searched for the secret of leadership by studying why certain leaders achieve enviable results where others do not. To the detriment of the study of leadership, rarely do we look to the individuals around the senior leader. We assume the leader controls the process, undervaluing the role of followers and situational context. Moreover, we pretend that leadership is goals-driven, and that good outcomes can be gained through the correct formula of effective leadership. We wrongly believe that what happened in one leadership instance can be replicated in another.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This common understanding of leadership, when held up against the reality of how leadership actually works, reveals three myths, which we'll discuss in more detail in the book's final two chapters:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Formulaic Myth: In our attempt to understand process, we strive to tame leadership into a static checklist, ignoring the reality that leadership is intensely contextual, and always dependent upon particular circumstances.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Attribution Myth: We attribute too much to leaders, having a biased form of tunnel vision focused on leaders themselves, and neglecting the agency of the group that surrounds them. We're led to believe that leadership is what the leader does, but in reality, outcomes are attributable to far more than the individual leader.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Results Myth: We say that leadership is the process of driving groups of people toward outcomes. That's true, to a point, but it's much broader than that. In reality, leadership describes what leaders symbolize more than what they achieve. Productive leadership requires that followers find a sense of purpose and meaning in what their leaders represent, such as social identity or some future opportunity.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The power and prevalence of this mythology of leadership rival those of religion or romance-these myths seem universal and inseparable from our existence as humans. They reflect a disconnect between how things should be and how we find them in practice and yet we knowingly live with this disconnect. For instance, corporate executives often speak of the importance of leadership, but when they're asked to list the threats to their business, they generally list exogenous factors, rarely listing their own leadership as a risk factor.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In part, we live with this mythology because it serv...</p></p><h2>The Best of Richard Matheson (Penguin Classics)</h2><p><b>With Jordan Peele's Twilight Zone reboot arriving, read the stories that inspired some of the show's greatest episodes, including "Nightmare at 20,000 Feet"!<br><br>The definitive collection of terrifying stories by "one of the greatest writers of the 20th century" (Ray Bradbury), edited by award-winning author Victor LaValle<br><br></b>Among the greats of 20th-century horror and fantasy, few names stand above Richard Matheson. Though known by many for novels like <i>I Am Legend</i> and his sixteen <i>Twilight Zone</i> episodes, Matheson truly shines in his chilling, masterful short stories.

But above the remote planet Akiva, an ominous show of the enemy&#x2019;s strength is unfolding. Out on a lone reconnaissance mission, pilot Wedge Antilles watches Imperial Star Destroyers gather like birds of prey circling for a kill, but he&#x2019;s taken captive before he can report back to the New Republic leaders.<br> &nbsp;<br> Meanwhile, on the planet&#x2019;s surface, former rebel fighter Norra Wexley has returned to her native world&#x2014;war weary, ready to reunite with her estranged son, and eager to build a new life in some distant place. But when Norra intercepts Wedge Antilles&#x2019;s urgent distress call, she realizes her time as a freedom fighter is not yet over.

That&#x2019;s old thinking. &#x201c;The <i>New Republic. </i>They need to know.&#x201d; <br><br> A third Star Destroyer suddenly cuts through space, appearing in line with the others. <br><br> &#x201c;You got family down there?&#x201d;&nbsp;She offers a stiff nod. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s why I&#x2019;m here.&#x201d; <i>That&#x2019;s why I&#x2019;m home. <br><br></i> &#x201c;This was always a risk. The Empire&#x2019;s been here on Akiva for years. Not like <i>this, </i>but . . . they&#x2019;re here, and we&#x2019;re gonna have to deal with it.&#x201d; He leans in and says: &#x201c;You know why I call this ship the <i>Moth</i>?&#x201d; <br><br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t.&#x201d; <br><br> &#x201c;You ever try to catch a moth? Cup your hands, chase after it, catch it? White moth, brown moth, any moth at all? You can&#x2019;t do it. They always get away. Herky-jerky up-and-down left-and-right.

That&#x2019;s this ship.&#x201d; <br><br> &#x201c;I still don&#x2019;t like it.&#x201d; <br><br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t like it, either, but life is full of unlikable things. You wanna see your family again? Then we&#x2019;re doing this. Now&#x2019;s the time, too. Looks like they&#x2019;re just getting set up. Might could be more on the way.&#x201d; <br><br> A half-mad gleam in his one good eye. His other: an implacable red lens framed in an ill-fitting O-ring bolted to the scarred skin. He grins, then: crooked teeth stretched wide. He actually likes this. <br><br> <i>Smugglers, </i>she thinks.&nbsp;Well, she paid for the ticket. Time to take the ride. <br><br> The long black table gleams with light shining up from it&#x2014;a holo-graphic schematic of the <i>Vigilance</i>&#x2019;s docking bay and surrounding environs. It incorporates a fresh droid scan and shows damage to two of the TIE fighters, not to mention the bodies of the stormtroopers&#x2014; those left there as a reminder to others what can happen when you tussle with rebels. <br><br> The pilot of the Starhopper? Most definitely a rebel. Now the question: Was this an attack? Did he know they were here? Or is this some confluence of events, some crass coincidence that led to this intersection? <br><br> That, a problem for later. The problem now is figuring out just where he went. Because as she thought, the ship contained no body. <br><br> Best she can figure, he rigged the proton torpedoes to blow. Before they did, however, he . . . what? She taps a button, goes back to the Starhopper schematic she pulled off the Imperial databases. There. A stern-side door. Small, but enough to load small parcels of cargo in and out. <br><br> Her new pilot friend ducked out the back. Would&#x2019;ve been a considerable jump. <i>Jedi? </i>No. Couldn&#x2019;t be. Only one of those out there&#x2014;and zero chance the rebels would send their golden boy, Skywalker. <br><br> Back to the bay schematic&#x2014;&nbsp;<br><br> She spins it. Highlights the access ducts.&nbsp;<br><br> That&#x2019;s it. She pulls her comm. &#x201c;Tothwin. Our pilot is in the ducts. I&#x2019;ll bet all my credits you&#x2019;ll find an open vent&#x2014;&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br> &#x201c;We have a problem.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br> <i>The problem is that you interrupted me, </i>she thinks but does not say. &#x201c;What is it?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br> &#x201c;We have a blockade-runner.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br> &#x201c;Another terrorist?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br> &#x201c;Could be. Looks like a bog-standard smuggler, though. Flying a small Corellian freighter&#x2014;an, ahh, let&#x2019;s see, an MK-4.&#x201d; <br><br> &#x201c;Dispatch the TIEs. Let them deal with it.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x201c;Of course, Admiral.&#x201d; <br><br> Everything feels like it&#x2019;s in slow motion. Norra sits, frozen in the navigator&#x2019;s chair next to Owerto Naiucho, the scar-faced smuggler&#x2014;flashes of light on his face, green light from the incoming lasers, orange light blooming from a TIE fighter meeting its untimely end. Outside, ahead of them, a swarm of TIEs like a cloud of insects&#x2014;the horrible scream as they pass, vibrating the chair beneath her and the console gripped in her white-knuckled hands. In the moments when she blinks, she doesn&#x2019;t see darkness. She sees another battle unfolding&#x2014; <br><br> <i>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a trap!&#x201d; comes Ackbar&#x2019;s voice over the comm. The dread feeling as Imperial TIEs descend upon them like redjacket wasps from a rock- struck nest. The dark of space lighting up with a crackling beam of viridian light&#x2014;that coming from the half-constructed Death Star, just one more shovelful of dirt on the Alliance&#x2019;s grave as one of their own capital ships is gone, erased in a pulse of light, lightning, and fire&#x2014; <br><br></i> The freighter dives toward the planet&#x2019;s surface. Turning like a screw. The ship shuddering as laserfire scores its side. The shields won&#x2019;t hold forever. Owerto&#x2019;s yelling at her: &#x201c;You need to handle the guns! Norra! <i>The guns.</i>&#x201d; But she can&#x2019;t get up out of that chair. Her bloodless hands won&#x2019;t even leave the console. Her mouth is dry. Her underarms wet. Her heart is beating like a pulsar star before it goes dark. <br><br> <i>&#x201c;We want you to fly with us,&#x201d; Captain Antilles says. She objects, of course&#x2014;she&#x2019;s been working for the rebels for years now, since before the destruction of the first Death Star, but as a freighter pilot. Carrying message droids, or smuggling weapons, or just shuttling people from planet to planet and base to base. &#x201c;And that doesn&#x2019;t change the kind of pilot you are,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;You outran a Star Destroyer. You forced two TIE interceptors to crash into each other. You&#x2019;ve always been a great pilot. And we need you now for when General Solo gets those shield generators down.&#x201d; He asks her again: Is she in? Will she fly with the red and the gold? Yes. She says yes. Because of course she does&#x2014;how could she say otherwise? <br><br></i> Everything, gone dizzy. Lights inside the cabin flashing. A rain of sparks from somewhere behind their chairs. Here in the <i>Moth, </i>everything feels balanced on the head of a pin. Through the glass, the planet. The clouds, coming closer. TIE fighters punching holes through them, vapor swirling behind them. She stands up, hands shaking. <br><br> <i>Inside the bowels of the beast. Pipes and hissing steam. Skeletal beams and bundles of cord and conduit. The guts of the resurrected Death Star. The shields are down. This is their one chance. But the TIE fighters are everywhere. Coming up behind them, hawks nipping at their tail feathers. She knows where this goes: It means she&#x2019;s going to die. But that&#x2019;s how things get done. Gold Leader comms in&#x2014;Lando&#x2019;s voice in her ear, and his Sullustan copilot&#x2019;s just behind it. They tell her what to do. And again she thinks: </i>This is it, this is how I die. <i>She accelerates her fighter. The heat signature of the core goes left. She pulls her Y-wing right&#x2014;and a handful of the TIEs break off and follow her deeper. Away from the </i>Millennium Falcon. <i>Away from the X-wings. Laserfire frying her engines. Popping the top off her astromech. Smoke filling the cabin. The smell of ozone&#x2014; <br><br></i> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not a gunner,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m a pilot.&#x201d; <br><br> Then she pulls Owerto out of his pilot&#x2019;s chair. He protests, but she gives him a look&#x2014;a look she&#x2019;s practiced, a look where her face hardens like cooling steel, the look of a raptor before it takes your eyes. The smuggler gives a barely perceptible nod, and it&#x2019;s good that he does. Because as soon as she&#x2019;s down in the chair and grabbing the stick and throttle, she sees a pair of TIE fighters coming up fast from the front&#x2014; <br><br> Her teeth clamp down so hard she thinks her jaw might break. Lasers like demon fire score the sky ahead, coming right for them. <br><br> She pulls back on the stick. The <i>Moth </i>ceases its dive toward the planet&#x2019;s surface&#x2014;the lasers just miss, passing under the hind end of the freighter, continuing on&#x2014; <br><br> <i>Boom. <br><br></i> They take out two of the TIE fighters that had been following close behind. And even as she continues hauling back on the stick, her stomach and heart trading places, the blood roaring in her ears, she loopty-loops the ship just in time to see the remaining two TIEs clip each other. Vertical wing panels smashing together, prying apart&#x2014; each of the short-range Imperial fighters suddenly spinning away, pirouetting wildly through space like a pair of Republic Day firecracker pinwheels. <br><br> &#x201c;We got more incoming!&#x201d; Owerto hollers from somewhere behind her&#x2014;and then she hears the gears of the <i>Moth</i>&#x2019;s twin cannons grinding as the turret spins into place and begins barking fire. <br><br> Clouds whip past.&nbsp;<br><br> The ship bangs and judders as it kicks a hole in the atmosphere. <br><br> <i>This is my home, </i>she thinks. Or was. She grew up on Akiva. More important, Norra then was like Norra now: She doesn&#x2019;t much care for people. She went off on her own a lot. Explored the wilds outside the capital city of Myrra&#x2014;the old temples, the cave systems, the rivers, the canyons. <br><br> She knows those places. Every switchback, every bend, every nook and cranny. Again she thinks, <i>This is my home, </i>and with that mantra set to repeat, she stills her shaking hands and banks hard to starboard, corkscrewing the ship as laserfire blasts past. <br><br> The planet&#x2019;s surface comes up fast. Too fast, but she tells herself that she knows what she&#x2019;s doing. Down there, the rise of lush hills and slick-faced cliffs give way to the Canyon of Akar&#x2014;a winding serpentine valley, and it&#x2019;s there she takes the <i>Moth. </i>Into the rain-forested channel. Drizzle speckling her view, streaking away. The wings of the freighter clip branches, tearing up a flurry of leaves as she jukes left and jerks right, making the <i>Moth </i>one helluva hard target to hit. <br><br> Laserfire sears the canopy ahead.&nbsp;<br><br> Then: a bank of fog.&nbsp;<br><br> She pushes down on the stick, takes the freighter even lower. Here, the canyon is tighter. Trees stretching out like selfish hands, thrust up from rocky outcroppings. Norra deliberately clips these&#x2014;again on the left, then on the right. The <i>Moth</i>&#x2019;s turrets belt out cannon fire and suddenly a TIE comes tumbling end-over-end like a flung boulder&#x2014; she has to bank the ship hard to dodge it. It smashes into a tree. A belching fireball. <br><br> The freighter shudders.&nbsp;<br><br> More sparks. The cabin goes dark. Owerto: &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve lost the turrets!&#x201d; <br><br> Norra thinks: <i>We don&#x2019;t need them.<br>&nbsp;</i><br> Because she knows what&#x2019;s coming. One of the oldest temple complexes&#x2014;abandoned, an artifact of architecture from a time long, long ago, when the Ahia-Ko people dwelled here still. But before that: a cascading waterfall, a silver churn of water leaping over a cliff &#x2019;s edge. A cliff they call the Witch&#x2019;s Finger for the way it looks like a bent and accusing digit. There&#x2019;s a space underneath that bridge of stone, a narrow channel. <i>Too narrow, </i>she thinks. But maybe not. Especially not with the turret gone. Too late to do differently now&#x2014; <br><br> She turns the freighter to its side&#x2014; <br><br> Ahead, the gap under the rock. Waterfall on one side. Jagged cliff face on the other. Norra stills her breathing. Opens her eyes wide. <br><br> That mantra comes one last time, spoken aloud:&nbsp;<br><br> &#x201c;This is my home.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br> The freighter passes through the channel.&nbsp;<br><br> It shakes like an old drunk&#x2014;what&#x2019;s left of the turret shears off. Clangs away, spinning into the waterfall spray&#x2014; <br><br> But they&#x2019;re out. Clean. Alive.&nbsp;<br><br> On the console, two blinking red blips.&nbsp;<br><br> TIE fighters. Behind them. <br><br> <i>Wait for it.<br>&nbsp;</i><br> <i>Wait . . . for it . . .<br>&nbsp;</i><br> The air claps with a pair of explosions.&nbsp;<br><br> The two blips flicker and are gone.&nbsp;<br><br> Owerto hoots and claps his hands. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re clear!&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br> <i>Damn right we are.<br>&nbsp;</i><br> She turns the freighter and sets a course for the outskirts of Myrra.</p><h2>The Peacock Emporium: A Novel</h2><p><b>An early work from the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>The Giver of Stars</i>, Jojo Moyes, the story of a young woman who opens an eclectic shop and comes to terms with the secrets of her past.</b><br><br>In the sixties, Athene Forster was the most glamorous girl of her generation.

The first time Harriet and Beth Ellen ever saw anyone get one was one day in July when they were in the supermarket in Water Mill. They were standing at the checkout counter waiting to pay for their cookies. The woman with mean eyes who always checked them out was getting ready to charge them, when she suddenly drew her hand back from the cash register as though bitten by a snake.<br><br>"What in the world . . . ?" she shrieked, and Harriet almost broke her stomach in two leaning over the counter to see. The woman held up a large piece of paper on which was written awkwardly in red crayon:<br><br>Jesus hates you<br><br>"What is that? What in the world is that? Why would someone do that? What could they mean by that? Why would they say that to me? To me . . . to me?" The woman screamed on and on. A clerk came running. The manager of the store came running. Harriet stood with half-closed eyes, watching. Beth Ellen stared. Everyone began talking at once.<br><br>"Jake at the feed store got one."<br><br>"They're all over town. Everybody in Water Mill has gotten one."<br><br>"Why doesn't somebody do something? What is this?"<br><br>"They have. Mr. Jackson went to the police."<br><br>"What happened?"<br><br>"Well, they're looking around. What can they do? They can't find out who's doing it."<br><br>"Maybe they're protecting somebody."<br><br>"Yeah. Didn't have none of this all winter. One of those summer people flipped, maybe."<br><br>For some reason everyone turned and looked at Harriet and Beth Ellen. Harriet was so busy writing down everything in the notebook she always carried that she didn't notice, but Beth Ellen started to back out of the door.<br><br>"This all you have, kids?" The woman at the register suddenly became very sharp and businesslike.<br><br>"Yes," said Harriet in what she hoped was a disinterested way.<br><br>Beth Ellen was already out on the street. Harriet saw her streaking for the long black car.<br><br>"Well, I'll tell you," said the checkout lady as she put the cookies in a bag, "there's some mighty strange people in these parts of a summer."<br><br>Harriet stood a minute with the bag in her hand, hoping the woman would say more, but she just looked at Harriet expectantly. Feeling foolish, Harriet turned abruptly and left the store.<br><br>Outside, she walked slowly to the car. The air on this early morning was sweet, faintly wet, and clinging. She felt the same nostalgic joy that she felt every year. The memories of every summer of her life seemed to make the air thick and rich. It was all so beautifully familiar: the short stretch of stores along the Montauk Highway, the flag in front of the tiny post office, the sign saying You are entering Water Mill, New York. Slow down and enjoy it, which now was a virgin-white with black letters but by the end of the summer would be scrawled with drunken wit.<br><br>Even Beth Ellen, who sat waiting in the backseat of the big car driven by Harry, the Hansens' chauffeur, seemed a patient memory. Funny about Beth Ellen, thought Harriet as she climbed into the backseat. I never see her in the winter the way I do Janie and Sport, even though I go to school with her; and in the summer she's my best friend, just because she lives in Water Mill too, I guess.<br><br>The car glided off. She punched the button which raised the glass between the backseat and the front. She liked privacy. Besides, she liked pushing all those buttons.<br><br>"No, no," said Beth Ellen and pushed it again so that it lowered, "we have to tell him where we're going."<br><br>"I have to go to your house. I left my bike there," Harriet said, pushing the button again briskly. "Then shall we go to the beach?"<br><br>Beth Ellen looked frightened, but that was so much her normal expression that Harriet thought nothing of it. "I don't know if I can ride good enough to go that far."<br><br>"Sure you can. How're you ever going to learn if you don't try it? What good is a bike if you just ride around your driveway?"<br><br>"But I only learned a month ago." Beth Ellen began to munch a cookie in a distracted way.<br><br>"Well, I don't care if you come or not." Harriet delivered this last looking sideways at Beth Ellen. It worked.<br><br>"I didn't say I wasn't going. I want to go."<br><br>"I know what let's do." Harriet made her eyes into slits and pushed them so far sideways her head hurt. "Let's just run past the Evil Hotel on the way."<br><br>Beth Ellen turned an intense red.<br><br>"Hee, hee," said Harriet and looked out the window.<br><br>"If you want to," said Beth Ellen, trying to look bored. She succeeded only in looking faintly sick to her stomach.<br><br>"If I want to!" said Harriet rudely. "HAH!"<br><br>"I thought you were writing a story about it," said Beth Ellen.<br><br>"I am," said Harriet, "but only because we've spent practically the whole summer there! I haven't anything else to write a story about! What have I seen this summer? Only that silly Bunny! And what have I heard this summer? Only that silly Bunny play the piano!" She sounded quite angry. "Well!" she said emphatically and stopped.<br><br>"Well, you don't have to come," said Beth Ellen with a little smile.<br><br>"I'm coming," said Harriet. "I have to finish my story now, don't I?" She grabbed for the cookie box and stuffed three in her mouth. Beth Ellen smiled. Harriet saw her and said with her mouth full, "Listen, Mouse, for a mouse you sure get your own way all the time." Beth Ellen looked out the window to hide her tiny smile.<br><br>The car turned into the driveway of Beth Ellen's house. "I have to go and see my grandmother before I go," said Beth Ellen in a rather mournful way.<br><br>"That's okay," said Harriet. "I'll just fool around here." She didn't even look at Beth Ellen, because she was watching Harry. She had been spying on him all summer, and he bore careful watching. Harry seemed to lead a very curious life.<br><br>"And anyway," said Beth Ellen as she slammed the door to the car, "it's you that call it the Evil Hotel. I don't."<br><br>Harriet started to shout something after her, but Beth Ellen shot through the door. Hhrumph, she thought, I just called it that to bug her. I never saw anybody with such a crush. I hope I never have one.<br><br>She marched off to the servants' quarters, which were attached to the garage. Covering her course as well as she could by a row of hedges, she stationed herself at the window of Harry's room.</p><h2>Claude Debussy: Piano Music (1888-1905)</h2><p>This volume contains the complete music for solo piano written by Claude Debussy between 1888 and 1905.

The men are detouring around the square near the base of the citadel because they don&#x2019;t yet want her to see the deportees who arrived here last night--there will be time for that soon enough--but she fears she is going to be sick anyway. The smell of rotting flesh, excrement, and the July heat are conspiring to churn her stomach far worse than even the trip across the Atlantic had weeks earlier. She feels clammy and weak-kneed and reaches out for her father&#x2019;s elbow to steady herself. Her father, in turn, gently taps her fingers with his hand, his vague and abstracted attempt at a comforting gesture.<br><br>&#x201c;Miss Endicott, do you need to rest? You look a little peaked,&#x201d; the consul says, and she glances at him. His brown eyes are wide and a little crazed, and already there are thin rivulets of sweat running down both sides of his face. He is wearing a beige linen jacket, which she imagines to be infinitely more comfortable than her father&#x2019;s gray woolen suit. She brings her free hand to her own face and feels the moisture there. She nods in response to his question; she does need to sit, though it embarrasses her to admit this. Still, it may be a nonissue. She can&#x2019;t see where she might on this squalid street. But Ryan quickly takes her arm and guides her from her father, leading her to a stoop on the shady side of the thin road. He wipes off the squat step with his bare hand. There is a ramshackle wooden door behind the stoop, shut tight against the midmorning heat, but she presumes that whoever lives there won&#x2019;t mind if she sits. And so there she rests and breathes in deeply and slowly through her mouth, watching the women in their headscarves and long, loose robes--some hide all but their eyes behind burqas--and the men in their ornate blazers, their voluminous, shapeless trousers, and their flowerpot-like fez hats. Some of the men glance at her sympathetically as they pass, others with a brazen want in their eyes. She has been warned.<br><br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s a nice breeze today,&#x201d; Ryan says cheerfully, and while she appreciates the slightly cooler air, wafting along with it is the stench from the square. &#x201c;Before you arrived, the heat was just unbearable.&#x201d;<br><br>She can&#x2019;t imagine it being hotter. At the moment, she can&#x2019;t imagine anywhere being hotter. And yet she found their apartment last night unexpectedly comfortable after the endless weeks aboard a ship, then a horse-drawn carriage, and finally two train cars that boasted only wooden seats. It was warm, but she had stood at her window for nearly half an hour in the middle of the night, gazing out at the row of statuesque cypress on the hill beyond the American compound and the bower of trees just inside the walls. She saw more stars than she ever saw in Boston, and the half moon seemed to dangle eerily, beautifully close to the earth.<br><br>Her father is surveying the rows of sand-colored two-story buildings that curl toward an alley, his arms folded across his chest, his face stern, and then she notes him arch his back suddenly and stand up a little straighter. Ryan sees what he sees and murmurs just loud enough for her to hear, &#x201c;Oh, Jesus, no. Not more.&#x201d; Both Ryan and her father glance down at her, but they realize there is absolutely nothing they can do; there is not a way in the world to shield her from what is coming. Besides, this is why she is here, isn&#x2019;t it? Didn&#x2019;t she volunteer to be a part of this aid mission? To chronicle what she sees for their organization, the Friends of Armenia, and to volunteer at the hospital--to do, in essence, whatever she could to help? Still, discomfort leaches from both men like perspiration, and she finds it interesting that they are as embarrassed as they are disgusted. If they had been here alone--if she had remained back at the American compound--her father and the American consul now would be experiencing only rage. And so she presses the palm of her hand against the wall of the house, the stone unexpectedly cool, and rises.<br><br>Approaching from down the street is a staggering column of old women, and she is surprised to observe they are African. She stares, transfixed. She thinks of the paintings and drawings she has seen of American slave markets in the South from the 1840s and 1850s, though weren&#x2019;t those women and men always clothed--if only in rags? These women are completely naked, bare from their feet to the long drapes of matted black hair. And it is the hair, long and straight though filthy and impossibly tangled, that causes her to understand that these women are white--at least they were once--and they are, in fact, not old at all. Many might be her age or even a little younger. All are beyond modesty, beyond caring. Their skin has been seared black by the sun or stained by the soil in which they have slept or, in some cases, by great yawning scabs and wounds that are open and festering and, even at this distance, malodorous. The women look like dying wild animals as they lurch forward, some holding on to the walls of the stone houses to remain erect. She has never in her life seen people so thin and wonders how in the name of God their bony legs can support them. Their breasts are lost to their ribs. The bones of their hips protrude like baskets.<br><br>&#x201c;Elizabeth, you don&#x2019;t need to watch,&#x201d; her father is saying, but she does. She does.<br><br>Herding the women forward through the town are half a dozen young men, two on horseback who look nearly as weak as the women, and four walking beside the group. All of them have rifles slung over their shoulders. They, too, don&#x2019;t look any older than Elizabeth, and it crosses her mind that the pair nearest her can&#x2019;t be more than fifteen or sixteen; their moustaches are wisps, a boy&#x2019;s attempt to look like a man.<br><br>Just before the group reaches them, the gendarmes guide the women down the narrow street that will lead eventually to the square beneath the citadel, where they will be deposited with the deportees who arrived here yesterday. The men are short-tempered and tired. They strike the women when they move slowly or clumsily. They yank them back to their feet by their hair when they collapse. Elizabeth tries to count the women as they turn to the right and disappear into the alley, but reflexively she looks away whenever one of the skeletons meets her eye. Still, she guesses there are at least 125 of them. She verbalizes the number aloud without thinking.<br><br>&#x201c;I assure you, Miss Endicott,&#x201d; says Ryan, &#x201c;when that group left Zeitun or Adana or wherever, there were at least a thousand of them.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why did the Turks take their clothes?&#x201d; she asks him.<br><br>He shakes his head. &#x201c;They don&#x2019;t usually--unless they&#x2019;re planning to kill them. Sometimes they take the men&#x2019;s clothes immediately before executing them; they worry the clothes of the dead are defiled. But I have no idea why they did in this case. Degrade the survivors, maybe. Perhaps increase the chances they&#x2019;ll die on their own in the sun. But don&#x2019;t look for reason in any of this.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And where are the men?&#x201d;<br><br>He dabs at his forehead with a handkerchief. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s safe to assume they&#x2019;re dead. Either they were--&#x201d; He doesn&#x2019;t finish because her father glares at the consul to be silent. To be still. Her father is hoping to introduce her to this world gradually. In increments. They discussed it little on either the ship or the train. Generalities of Ottoman history only.<br><br>Later this month, the two doctors in their party will arrive and they will start work. They--along with a returning missionary named Alicia Wells--telegrammed that their ship was going to be delayed leaving Boston, and might then take a more roundabout course to avoid U-boats. But whether the physicians are delayed two weeks or three might make all the difference in the world for some of the survivors who are brought here. These women, she presumes, will be long gone by then, marched back into the desert to one of the resettlement camps to the southeast. So will the group that is already in the square, the women and children who staggered in from the desert yesterday.<br><br>In the meantime, Elizabeth can&#x2019;t imagine what in the name of God she--what anyone--can do for them. Still, after catching her breath, she and her father and the American consul decide that instead of spending lunch discussing the conditions in Aleppo and planning for the arrival of the rest of their group, they will follow these woeful deportees down the alley and into the square, and there see what they can do to help.<br><br>Ryan Martin leaves to find rags for the women to wear, but by the time he returns with a wagon of tattered dresses and blouses--remnants from the dead who have passed through Aleppo that summer--the newly arrived deportees already have been clothed by the other refugees. In the meantime, Elizabeth and a nurse from the hospital pick at the vermin on the women and clean the gaping wounds on their legs and ankles and feet. They ration the little calamine lotion and olive oil they have for those women whose sunburns have not seared deep into their flesh, and gently wash the wounds of those whose skin--especially on their shoulders and backs--has peeled off like a snake&#x2019;s. Within minutes they finish off the one large bottle of iodine the nurse has brought. Elizabeth gives the deportees water and bowls of thin bulgur soup to eat, because it is all they can scare up at the moment. There may be bread tomorrow. She feels helpless. When she was given her nursing training back in Boston, no one prepared her for dysentery. For gangrene. For feet with bones splintered from weeks of walking barefoot, the toes and heels swollen and mangled and deformed.<br><br>Most of the women are clustered underneath makeshift tents--canvas pulled tight on tottering wooden poles--but there are more women than there is room, so they spread out beyond the tent when the sun is no longer overhead and there are long stripes of comforting black shade. The children--among whom the only males in this new group can be found--remind her of dead sea horses she once saw on the beach at Cape Cod: The children, like the sea horses, are curled up on their sides and their bones seem as brittle and sharp as the shells of the dried pipefish. Perhaps a quarter mile away is a hospital, primitive by Boston standards, but a hospital nonetheless. It infuriates Elizabeth that there is, apparently, no room for these women there, and so far not a single doctor has emerged from the building and offered to help. Ryan has tried to mollify her by telling her that the vast majority of the beds there are filled with Armenian women and children, but this reality too has left her seething inside.<br><br>The number of deportees who speak either English or French surprises Elizabeth, though most are too tired right now to talk. Nevertheless, there is a woman who looks to be in her fifties but Elizabeth suspects is actually half that age, who murmurs &#x201c;thank you&#x201d; in English as she takes the bowl of soup and brings it to her lips.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re welcome,&#x201d; Elizabeth says. &#x201c;I wish it were a more substantial meal.&#x201d;<br><br>The woman shrugs. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re American,&#x201d; she observes, a statement. She is wearing a man&#x2019;s shirt and a skirt that balloons around her like a sack.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes. My name is Elizabeth.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m Nevart,&#x201d; the Armenian offers, and Elizabeth carefully rolls the name around in her mind. A small girl sleeps beside the woman, the child&#x2019;s collarbone rising and falling ever so slightly with each breath. Elizabeth guesses that she is seven or eight. &#x201c;Where in America?&#x201d; Nevart asks.<br><br>&#x201c;Boston,&#x201d; Elizabeth answers. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s in the state of Massachusetts.&#x201d; The woman&#x2019;s nails are as brown as her skin. &#x201c;Sip that soup slowly,&#x201d; she adds.<br><br>Nevart nods and places the bowl in her lap. &#x201c;I know where Boston is,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;I heard you speaking Armenian a minute ago. How much do you know?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A little. Very little, actually. I know mostly vocabulary. I know words, not grammar.&#x201d; Then Elizabeth asks the woman, &#x201c;How did you learn English?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;My husband went to college in London. He was a doctor.&#x201d;<br><br>Elizabeth thinks about this, imagining this wraith of a woman living in England. As if Nevart can read her mind, the deportee continues, &#x201c;I wasn&#x2019;t with him most of the time. I have been to London, but only for a visit.&#x201d; She sighs and looks into Elizabeth&#x2019;s eyes. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not going to die,&#x201d; she murmurs, and she almost sounds disappointed.<br><br>&#x201c;No, of course, you won&#x2019;t. I know that.&#x201d; Elizabeth hopes she sounds reassuring. She honestly isn&#x2019;t sure whether this woman will live.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re just saying that. But I know it because I was a doctor&#x2019;s wife. I have survived dysentery. Starvation. Dehydration. They . . . never mind what they did to me. I am still alive.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Is that your little girl?&#x201d; Elizabeth asks.<br><br>The woman shakes her head. &#x201c;No,&#x201d; she answers, gently massaging the child&#x2019;s neck. &#x201c;This is Hatoun. Like me, she is unkillable.&#x201d;<br><br>Elizabeth wants to ask about the woman&#x2019;s husband, but she doesn&#x2019;t dare. The man is almost certainly dead. Likewise, she wonders if Nevart has lost her children as well, but again she knows no good can come from this inquiry. Wouldn&#x2019;t the Armenian have said something about her own children if they were with her now--if they were alive?<br><br>Over the woman&#x2019;s shoulder Elizabeth spies her father in the distance. He is ladling out the soup from a black cauldron and handing it to the women strong enough to stand and bring it to those who are collapsed under the tent. His sideburns and his beard, so much thicker and grayer than the thin whorls of cinnamon atop his scalp, look almost white in this light. They are expecting flour and sugar and tea in the next day or so--the first of two shipments they have arranged this month--though Ryan has warned her father and her that it is likely only a small fraction of what they have acquired will actually arrive in Aleppo.<br><br>&#x201c;Where do we go next?&#x201d; Nevart asks her. &#x201c;They brought us here, but they won&#x2019;t let us stay.&#x201d;</p><h2>Trauma Systems Therapy for Children and Teens</h2><p>This highly practical book has helped thousands of clinicians make the most of limited resources to support children and families struggling with chronic, multiple adversities.

Everything in this volume makes complete sense, especially with regard to understanding and assessing the traumatized child's survival-in-the-moment states. Recommendations for planning treatment and integrating services are clear and concise. Readers will find this a valuable resource for developing comprehensive services for children and families exposed to traumatic life events."--Anthony P. Mannarino, PhD, Department of Psychiatry, Allegheny General Hospital and Drexel University College of Medicine<br><br> "Building on the strengths of their first edition, the authors have incorporated innovations from successful adopters of TST. This treatment model tackles multiple real-world challenges to thoroughly assess traumatized children and their families and social environments. Interventions targeting both the impact of trauma and the barriers to care in the environment take into consideration key principles of neurobiology, child development, and family systems, as well as the evidence base for treating child traumatic stress. The book includes a full set of therapeutic activities and reproducible assessment tools and worksheets. The new chapter on organizational planning and implementation facilitates adoption of this unique model of integrated care."--Lisa Amaya-Jackson, MD, MPH, UCLA-Duke National Center for Child Traumatic Stress, Duke University School of Medicine<br><br> &nbsp;<br><br>"This second edition represents the growth of TST and its increased focus on the TST treatment team working within a much larger, multifaceted organizational system....The 10 years between the first and second edition of this book led to the creation of a more robust and encompassing treatment plan. This excellent book details the growth of TST and its expansion to include more than the population of traumatized children. Much was learned over those 10 years, and that learning is carefully laid out in a comprehensive, organized, and, to use the author&#x2019;s expression, &#x2018;real world&#x2019; manner. It is clear that Saxe, Ellis, and Brown have &#x2018;walked the walk&#x2019; and have created an excellent, important, well thought out, and detailed text which can have a profound impact on both providers and those in need of services. The book can be a valuable tool for any student or trainee in social work, psychology, psychiatry, pediatrics, or law who wishes for a greater understanding of the fundamentals of traumatic stress and its proper and effective management....This book breathes a breath of fresh air into a very thorny issue and does provide hope by focusing on the system as a target of therapy as well as on individual therapy....It is highly recommended for anyone working in or with agencies and with challenging populations.&#x201d; (<i>Child and Family Behavior Therapy</i> 2016-10-03)<br><br>"This book would be extremely supportive to clinicians working in schools, homes, clinics, or the community....It is also extremely useful knowledge for any practitioner working with trauma, either in children or adults....The book is, effectively, a gold mine of information on trauma....The information is easy to access and well presented....An excellent resource....If you work in the field, I think you need this book on your shelf.&#x201d; (<i>BACP Children and Young People</i> 2016-06-01)<br><br>"The authors provide helpful advice on the treatment of childhood traumatic stress that can be used by clinicians, teachers, social service workers, lawyers, administrators, policy makers....Helps guide individuals in the treatment of children as well as in the coordination of services under a financially constrained system of care."<i> </i>(on the first edition) (<i>Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry</i> 2007-09-09)<br><br>"An excellent resource for therapists who work with the children and families served by public mental health and child welfare systems.

I recommend it highly for clinicians working in children's mental health and for students in this field. In fact, I have been trying to find a way to buy copies for all of our state's contracted provider agencies, because I think they all could improve their practice by using at least some aspects of this approach.

Featuring a thematic organization, it helps students understand world mythology as a metaphor for humanity's search for meaning in a complex world.<br><br>Author David Leeming provides a sweeping anthology of myths, ranging from ancient Egypt and Greece to the Polynesian islands and modern science. Students will be captivated by stories of great floods from the ancient Babylonians, Hebrews, Chinese, and Mayans; tales of apocalypse from India, the Norse, Christianity, and modern science; and myths of the mother goddess from Native American Hopi culture and James Lovelock's Gaia. Leeming has culled myths from Aztec, Greek, African, Australian Aboriginal, Caribbean, Japanese, Muslim, Hittite, Celtic, Chinese, and Persian cultures, offering one of the most wide-ranging collections of what he calls the "collective dreams of humanity".<br></p><p><br><strong>David Leeming</strong> is Emeritus Professor of English and Comparative Literature at the University of Connecticut. He is the author or editor of numerous books on world mythology, including <em>The Oxford Companion to World Mythology</em> (2005).<br><br>"Leeming offers an amazing and extensive collection of mythology from around the world. This text will help students to understand the common themes and symbols used in myths, and also prepare them to become world citizens. There is no better exercise in critical thinking than to read another culture's mythology and compare it to one's own (or another culture's). If Joseph Campbell is correct when he says that 'We think mythically,' then Leeming's text excels at teaching its readers how to communicate with a diverse world."--Justin Stone, <em>Valencia State College</em><p></p><br>"The diversity of examples brought to each topic is wonderful. Including not only mythic but also scientific approaches to issues ranging from creation to the end of the world makes <em>The World of Myth</em> a delicious tasting plate of worldviews."--David Fletcher, <em>Kendall College of Art and Design</em><p></p><br>"As a lifelong aficionado of mythology, I am very impressed with how <em>The World of Myth</em> is comprehensive, compelling, and easy to read. As an English professor of world literature, Leeming contextualizes mythology in such a way that my students will not have a problem understanding how myths are still relevant to today's various world cultures."--Devona Mallory, <em>Albany State University</em><p></p><br>"One of the best things about this text is that it is not focused exclusively on ancient Greek, Roman, and Near Eastern myths. Its inclusion of Native North/South/Central American and Asian myths makes it especially compelling for a course that is truly intended to be a global exploration of ancient myth."--Sara Craft, <em>Florida State University</em><p></p><br></p><h2>The Lost Art of Closing: Winning the Ten Commitments That Drive Sales</h2><p><b>&#x201c;Always be closing!&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Glengarry Glen Ross</i>, 1992</b><br><b> &#x201c;Never Be Closing!&#x201d; &#x2014;a sales book title, 2014</b><br><b> &#x201c;?????&#x201d; &#x2014;salespeople everywhere, 2017<br></b><br>For decades, sales managers, coaches, and authors talked about closing as the most essential, most difficult phase of selling. They invented pushy tricks for the final ask, from the &#x201c;take delivery&#x201d; close to the &#x201c;now or never&#x201d; close. <br> &nbsp;<br> But these tactics often alienated customers, leading to fads for the &#x201c;soft&#x201d; close or even abandoning the idea of closing altogether. It sounded great in theory, but the results were often mixed or poor. That left a generation of salespeople wondering how they should think about closing, and what strategies would lead to the best possible outcomes.<br> &nbsp;<br> Anthony Iannarino has a different approach geared to the new technological and social realities of our time. In <i>The Lost Art of Closing</i>, he proves that the final commitment can actually be one of the <i>easiest</i> parts of the sales process&#x2014;if you&#x2019;ve set it up properly with other commitments that have to happen long before the close. The key is to lead customers through a series of necessary steps designed to prevent a purchase stall.<br> &nbsp;<br> Iannarino addressed this in a chapter of <i>The Only Sales Guide You&#x2019;ll Ever Need&#x2014;</i>which he thought would be his only book about selling. But he discovered so much hunger for guidance about closing that he&#x2019;s back with a new book full of proven tactics and useful examples. <i>The Lost Art of Closing </i>will help you win customer commitment at ten essential points along the purchase journey. For instance, you&#x2019;ll discover how to:<br><br>� &nbsp;Compete on value, not price, by securing a <b>Commitment to Invest</b> early in the process.<br> &nbsp;<br> � &nbsp;Ask for a <b>Commitment to Build Consensus</b> within the client&#x2019;s organization, ensuring that your solution has early buy-in from all stakeholders.<br> &nbsp;<br> � &nbsp;Prevent the possibility of the sale falling through at the last minute by proactively securing a <b>Commitment to Resolve Concerns.<br><br></b><i>The Lost Art of Closing </i>will forever change the way you think about closing, and your clients will appreciate your ability to help them achieve real change and real results.\</p><p><b>Anthony Iannarino</b> is the bestselling author of <i>The Only Sales Guide You&#x2019;ll Ever Need</i> and the founder of The Sales Blog, which draws more than 50,000 readers every month. He leads a high-performing sales team, speaks to sales organizations nationwide, and teaches part time at the Capital University&#x2019;s Capital School of Management and Leadership. He lives with his family in Westerville, Ohio.<br> &nbsp;<br> www.thesalesblog.comChapter 1<br><br> A New Philosophy of Commitment Gaining<br><br> To sell effectively, you need a philosophy. Not the academic kind of philosophy that they teach in universities. You need a practical philosophy, like the Greeks practiced. The Greeks didn't just argue about philosophy in theory. They practiced philosophy.<br><br> If you were an Epicurean, you ate and drank because that was what a good life was made up of: pleasure. If you were a Stoic (a very popular idea now, by the way), you endured the hardships of life without complaint. Philosophy was about living in a way that was in line with what you believed. A philosophy should guide how you sell too.<br><br> Here's my philosophy, and it is a major thread that runs throughout this book: Selling isn't something you do to someone. It is something you do for someone and with someone.<br><br> If you want to be a consultative salesperson and a trusted advisor, this is the starting point in earning that moniker.<br><br> Caveat Emptor<br><br> Caveat emptor is Latin for "let the buyer beware," a general philosophy of sales dating to the time that people first started trading. It emphasizes the buyer's responsibility to protect himself from the merchant (read: salesperson). If you struck a bad deal, then it was your fault. You should have known better. How could you have let yourself get duped when you knew that merchants were always trying to put one over on you? Caveat emptor was a necessary philosophy because, for most of human history, selling was something that one person did to another. To this day, we still use the expression "you sold them." You "sold them" on your ideas or your product. Taking advantage of the rubes, you "sold them a bill of goods," parting them from their money without delivering the promised value. The idea of caveat emptor made it clear that the seller was acting for his own gain or for his company's benefit, or both. There was little indication that any selling was done for the benefit of the buyer.<br><br> Fortunately, times have changed. Because your clients have so many choices available to them, and because word of mouth has been amplified by the Internet and social media, caveat venditor is a more apt philosophy today. Caveat venditor means "let the seller beware." This is a good change, as it has suppressed a lot of bad sales behaviors. Now if a seller takes advantage of you, you can share your unhappy experience with your friends, family, and countless strangers on social media and various review sites. For today's sellers, the potential penalty for being self-oriented, manipulative, unfair, or deceitful is too high. One sale isn't worth the loss of countless future sales-something good sales organizations and salespeople have always known.<br><br> In truth, most salespeople don't want to take advantage of other people. Most people don't want to perform work that makes them feel bad about themselves or would make them guilty of harming others. And they don't have to. Sales can be a very rewarding career because, properly done, it requires that you help people get results they couldn't have achieved without you. And by doing so, you can develop deep, lasting, valuable relationships. Thus, selling isn't something you do to someone. Instead, you work with your clients, using your resourcefulness and initiative to create opportunities or possibilities for better outcomes. At your very best, you and your clients become strategic partners. You become your client's trusted advisor, a title you must earn and re-earn by consistently offering sound advice, by knowing and communicating what needs to happen for your client to produce better results.<br><br> The Right Mindset<br><br> How do you learn to embrace caveat venditor? Not to do it simply because that's what's currently being done in sales, but to really take it to heart? You start by developing the right mindset. Indeed, your mindset is one of the major determining factors of your success. The right mindset makes commitment gaining easier because your underlying beliefs are healthy and empowering. The six key components of the right mindset are confidence, caring, persistence, speaking from the client's mind, embracing concerns, and realizing it's not about you.<br><br> Confidence<br><br> Confidence-in yourself as well as in what you're selling-allows you to act with your customer's best interests at heart. Confidence permits you to ask a prospective client for the commitment to take the next step. It comes from the belief that you can and will make a difference for that client, and you will be able to deliver the outcomes they need. If you don't embrace these beliefs, your lack of confidence will show and will prevent you from gaining commitments.<br><br> Naturally, you won't feel confident that you'll make a positive difference for your client unless you believe in your product, service, or solution. If you aren't 100 percent sure about what you sell, your prospective client will sense the incongruity between what you say and what she sees. You may come across as being inauthentic, or seem like you aren't telling the truth or aren't sure about what you're saying. In short, if you don't really believe that your product is so great that your prospects must commit to the next step in the process, neither will they.<br><br> Let's take a quick look at what causes you to lose confidence and how you maintain it. Confidence in your product, service, solution, and company doesn't come from believing that your clients will never have problems. Instead, it comes from your understanding that no company delivers exceptional results without being able to effectively deal with the day-to-day challenges of executing. Even more important to maintaining your confidence is your belief that you are going to make a difference for your clients, and that you will be there to make sure they are taken care of when they have the inevitable challenges that come with real change initiatives. <br><br> Caring<br><br> Caring is the root of trust, and trust is the foundation of all relationships-including commercial relationships. Caring is what makes you other-oriented instead of self-oriented. This isn't the soft stuff in business; it's the hard stuff. All things being equal, relationships win. All things being unequal, relationships still win. Your job in sales is to make all things unequal by creating relationships of value. That means more than liking your client or having a personal relationship, even though both of these are extremely helpful in creating a preference for you, your company, and your solution. "Relationships of value" means that you create value for your clients as someone who provides ideas and advice-and who also ensures that the outcomes they sell are delivered. <br><br> You make selling more difficult when you are focused on "making the sale." That outcome is about what you want and what you'll receive for having won the deal. That inward focus prevents you from being effective in selling.<br><br> When you care about helping other people generate the results that they can't generate without you, your outward focus is part of what creates a preference and makes you easier to buy from. When your focus is on helping your dream clients make the changes that they need to make, gaining the commitments necessary to move forward-and eventually the commitment to buy from you-becomes natural and easy.<br><br> This is a mindset shift for most salespeople. Too often, they focus on booking appointments with potential clients that they can report to the sales manager when asked. You could instead focus on sharing information and ideas that would help prospective clients understand why they need to change now. Too often, salespeople focus on "pushing" their product or service rather than engaging with the prospective client in producing better results through change. Too often, they focus on winning deals. But what if, instead, you focused on helping the client "win"? Truth be told, their win is your win-in that order.<br><br> Persistence<br><br> This is a book about commitment gaining in the complex sale. Sales is now all about helping people change, but change isn't easy. You are going to have to be persistent. I mean really, really persistent.<br><br> You are going to ask for commitments that your prospective clients will refuse to make. They are going to fear change-even when they know it is necessary. Your dream clients will refuse the commitments that move them closer to the results they need, even when doing so hurts their company. They'll also fail to keep commitments, even though they had every intention of honoring them. Look, if this were easy, you wouldn't need this book.<br><br> You are going to have to persist in asking for and gaining the commitments you will need to help your dream clients move from their current state to the better future state available to them. You're going to hear no, and know that you'll have to try again. You are also going to have meetings canceled, voice mails and e-mails unreturned, and prospects who drag their feet through the process. Do not be deterred. As Benjamin Franklin said, "Energy and persistence conquer all things."<br><br> Speaking from the Client's Mind<br><br> Great salespeople make great language choices. They have the right words for each situation, words that can work a kind of magic. That's why sales is more of an art than a science.<br><br> Many salespeople eagerly memorize the latest, greatest "selling words" and "selling phrases," convinced that having these on the tip of the tongue is the key to success. This means they're thinking of language as a tool to be mastered and used to hammer home sales, rather than as a means of developing great relationships with potential clients, of encouraging the flow of ideas as you build toward a better future.<br><br> It is certainly important to be well versed in the words and phrases used by potential clients when speaking of the technical aspects of their business. But it is just as important to keep your mind focused on the client's needs, challenges, and goals when communicating with him. Before speaking up, take a moment to think of the client's challenges and goals. Mentally make them your own, then speak. Now that you are speaking, in a sense, "from your client's mind," you will naturally communicate your desire to help him succeed. The actual words you use are less important than communicating this desire.<br><br> There's no set formula for selecting the right words, but here's a rule of thumb: If the language you use makes you feel bad about yourself, if it feels tricky or coercive in any way, you're not speaking from your client's mind. You're speaking from your own desire to win the sale. When you are self-oriented, your intentions and your words betray you.<br><br> I am not saying that working your way through the sales process won't sometimes make some of your prospective clients uncomfortable. No doubt they will sometimes have to face unpleasant facts. And you will likely have to present this unhappy data to get them to realize that it is time to make a major change. But when you fix your mind on helping your client before you speak, your words will be much more powerful.<br><br> You acquire good language choices in a couple of different ways. Sometimes you are lucky enough to work with a peer or manager who happens to have an excellent command of language, because he or she speaks from the client's mind. You can learn a lot by considering carefully what you hear and by practicing thinking in such a way that similar language flows easily from your lips. In fact, if people on your team make great language choices, ask to join them on sales calls so you can absorb not just the words they use, but the mindset they adopt to produce those words.<br><br> The nice thing about the dynamic human interaction that is a sales call is that, if you listen well, you can receive immediate feedback as to whether what you are doing is working. You can literally see the impact it is making, good or bad, in real time. You can use that real-time feedback to make adjustments as you strive to develop the right communication mindset.<br><br> Embracing Concerns<br><br> The very act of asking for commitments means that you are going to hear the word "no" more often than you would like. That's why "overcoming objections" is one of the major skills salespeople have long been taught. That language hasn't really kept up with the evolution of sales. A healthier and more accurate description of what successful salespeople do is "embrace and resolve concerns."<br><br> An objection is a disagreement; it's a negative thing we want to avoid. Just thinking of the word "objection" when a prospect expresses concerns can make you feel as if you have to "win" the conversation. When that happens, you might perceive your dream client's expression of a very real concern as a challenge, a battle of wills. By changing your perception, by seeing an "objection" as a real concern worth addressing, you can change your mindset and change your approach. You can be curious and work to understand the source of that objection.<br><br> As you will learn later in this book, your prospective clients often fear the wrong danger. If you don't, can't, or won't embrace and address their concerns and fears, they are justified in resisting moving forward. Why would you ever agree to something that you don't feel is in your best interest? Why, then, should you ever expect your clients to?<br><br> Helping your prospective clients deal with their fears, real or imagined, is how salespeople help their clients change. This change is what is always necessary for producing greater results. If your dream clients could get the results they need without doing something different, they'd already be producing those results.<br><br> Salespeople struggle when they don't know how to respond when their prospective client says no. Don't struggle: Embrace and resolve.<br><br> Realizing It's Not About You<br><br> The better you understand your prospective client's point of view, desires, and needs, the more effectively you can help them reach their goals and the more trust you can build in your relationship. Conversely, if you don't know what they're struggling to achieve, if you don't understand their point of view, how can you know what to offer them? And why should they believe anything you have to say, or even agree to a meeting in the first place? To be an effective salesperson, you need to look at the world through your client's eyes, to adopt their perspective.<br><br> Make no mistake about it: Being other-oriented is a powerful mindset, for we are naturally self-oriented beings. But this skill can be developed. You can learn to take the perspective of "other" and look at things through your dream client's eyes. Begin by asking yourself:<br><br> If you were your dream client, what might you be struggling to achieve?</p><h2>Swept Away</h2><p><strong>Look for Robyn&#x2019;s new book, <em>The Best of Us</em>, a story about family, second chances and choosing to live your best life&#x2014;order your copy today!</strong><br><b>The emotional story of a young woman&#x2019;s journey as she leaves behind all the things she thought she wanted only to discover who she really is. #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Robyn Carr explores the challenges facing women today as they are valued for what&#x2019;s on the outside rather than the inside.

Rabbi Shais Taub, a world renown expert in Jewish mysticism as well as a mentor to many thousands of addicts, draws from his unique background to thoroughly address many of the concerns raised by Jewish addicts in recovery while also using Jewish knowledge to enrich the understanding of the spiritual principles of recovery for addicts of all faiths.</p><p>Rabbi Shais Taub and his wife, Brocha, were founding co-directors of the Jewish recovery community in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.<br><br>He currently resides with his wife and children in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and operates Congregation Conscious Contact, a Jewish prayer and meditation group for the enhancement of Twelve-Step recovery.Addiction and Spirituality are frequently used terms. Unfortunately, their real meaning is often misunderstood, resulting in much confusion and resistance to recovery.<br><br>In G-d of Our Understanding: Jewish Spirituality &amp; Recovery from Addiction, Rabbi Taub has masterfully elucidated these concepts. This is book which should be read by all clergy, therapists, people in recovery -- people who should be in recovery -- and their family members. --Rabbi Abraham J. Twerski, M.D., Founder, Medical Director Emeritus, Gateway Rehabilitation Center<br><br>Every now and again I run across a book that just grabs me. Rabbi Taub has written such a book. His understanding of the disease of addiction is refreshing. Instead of focusing on the pathology that causes addiction, he understands our problem from a unique perspective -- that addiction happens because of what is right about us. <br><br>It is obvious that this book is written by a man who has integrated his understanding of spirituality into his personal experience with recovery.

Forward, the curving arms fell short of each other, as if in a failed attempt to close the circle. But, in fact, the gap was there by design, with each arm terminating in colossal docking claws and gaping hangar portals.<br><br>Like some gluttonous beast, a Trade Federation vessel didn&#x2019;t so much load as gobble cargo, and for close to three standard days, the Revenue had been feeding at Dorvalla.<br><br>The outlying planet&#x2019;s principal commodity was lommite ore, a major component in the production of transparisteel viewports and starfighter canopies. Ungainly transports ferried the strip-mined ore into high orbit, where the payloads were transferred to a fleet of self-propelled barges, tenders, and cargo pods, many of them as large as shuttles, and all bearing the Spherical Flame sigil of the Trade Federation.<br><br>By the hundreds the unpiloted crafts streamed between the Dorvallan transports and the ring-shaped freighter, lured to the breach in the curving arms by powerful tractor beams. There the docking claws nudged the crafts through the magnetic containment fields that sealed the rectangular maws of the hangars.<br><br>Safeguarding the herd from attacks by pirates or other raiders flew patrols of bullet-nosed, quad-thruster starfighters, wanting shields but armed with rapid-fire laser cannons. The droids that piloted the ships answered to a central control computer located in the freighter&#x2019;s centersphere.<br><br>At the aft curve of the centersphere stood a command and control tower. The ship&#x2019;s bridge occupied the summit, where a robed figure paced nervously before an array of inwardly inclined viewports. The interrupted view encompassed the distal ends of the hangar arms and the seemingly ceaseless flow of pods, their dorsal surfaces aglow with sunlight. Beyond the arms and the rust-brown pods spun translucent-white Dorvalla.<br><br>&#x201c;Status,&#x201d; the robed figure hissed.<br><br>The Revenue&#x2019;s Neimoidian navigator responded from a thronelike chair set below the burnished floor of the bridge walkway.<br><br>&#x201c;The last of the cargo pods is being taken aboard, Commander Dofine.&#x201d; Neimoidian speech, while lilting, favored first syllables and elongated words.<br><br>&#x201c;Very well, then,&#x201d; Dofine replied. &#x201c;Recall the starfighters.&#x201d;<br><br>The navigator swiveled in his chair to face the walkway. &#x201c;So soon, Commander?&#x201d;<br><br>Dofine ceased his relentless pacing to cast a dubious look at his shipmate. Months in deep space had so honed Dofine&#x2019;s natural distrust that he was no longer certain of the navigator&#x2019;s intent. Was the navigator questioning his command in the hope of gaining status, or was there some good reason to delay recalling the starfighters? The distinction troubled Dofine, since he risked losing face by airing his suspicions and being proven wrong. He decided to gamble that the question had been prompted by concern and contained no hidden challenges.<br><br>&#x201c;I want those fighters recalled. The sooner we leave Dorvalla, the better.&#x201d;<br><br>The navigator nodded. &#x201c;As you will, Commander.&#x201d;<br><br>Captain of the Revenue&#x2019;s skeleton crew of living beings, Dofine had a pair of front-facing red oval eyes, a prominent muzzle, and a fish-lipped slash of mouth. Veins and arteries pulsed visibly beneath the surface of puckered and mottled pale-green skin. Small for his species&#x2014;the runt of his hive, some said behind his back&#x2014;his thin frame was draped in blue robes and a tufted, shoulder-padded mantle more appropriate for a cleric than a ship&#x2019;s commander. A tall cone of black fabric, even his headpiece suggested wealth and high office.<br><br>The navigator was similarly attired in robes and headpiece, though his floor-length mantle was solid black and of a simpler design. He communicated with the devices that encircled the shell-like pilot&#x2019;s chair by means of data readout goggles that cupped his eyes and a disk-shaped comlink that hid his mouth.<br><br>The Revenue&#x2019;s communications technician was a jowled and limpid-eyed Sullustan. The officer who interfaced with the central control computer was a Gran&#x2014;three-eyed, with a hircine face. Beaked and green-complexioned, the ship&#x2019;s assistant bursar was an Ishi Tib.<br><br>Dofine hated having to suffer aliens aboard his bridge, but he was compelled to do so as an accommodation to the lesser shipping concerns that had allied with the Trade Federation; small companies like Viraxo Shipping, and powerful shipbuilders like TaggeCo and Hoersch-Kessel.<br><br>Humaniform droids saw to all other tasks on the bridge.<br><br>Dofine had resumed his pacing when the Sullustan spoke.<br><br>&#x201c;Commander, Dorvalla Mining reports that the payment they received is short one hundred thousand Republic credits.&#x201d;<br><br>Dofine waved his long-fingered hand in dismissal. &#x201c;Tell her to recheck her figures.&#x201d;<br><br>The Sullustan relayed Dofine&#x2019;s words and waited for a reply. &#x201c;She claims that you said the same thing the last time we were here.&#x201d;<br><br>Dofine exhaled theatrically and gestured to a large circular screen at the rear of the bridge. &#x201c;Display her.&#x201d;<br><br>The magnified image of a red-haired, freckle-faced human woman was resolving on the screen by the time Dofine reached it.<br><br>&#x201c;I am not aware of any missing credits,&#x201d; he said without preamble.<br><br>The woman&#x2019;s blue eyes flashed. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t lie to me, Dofine. First it was twenty thousand, then fifty, now one hundred. How much will we have to forfeit the next time the Trade Federation graces Dorvalla with a visit?&#x201d;<br><br>Dofine glanced knowingly at the Ishi Tib, who returned a faint grin. &#x201c;Your world is far removed from normal space lanes,&#x201d; he said calmly toward the screen. &#x201c;As far from the Rimma Trade Route as from the Corellian Trade Spine. Your situation, therefore, demands additional expenditures. Of course, if you are displeased, you could always do business with some other concern.&#x201d;<br><br>The woman snorted a rueful laugh. &#x201c;Other concern? The Trade Federation has put everyone else under.&#x201d;<br><br>Dofine spread his large hands. &#x201c;Then what is a hundred thousand credits, more or less?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Extortion is what it is.&#x201d;<br><br>The sour expression Dofine adopted came naturally to his slack features. &#x201c;I suggest you file a complaint with the Trade Commission on Coruscant.&#x201d;<br><br>The woman fumed; her nostrils flared and her cheeks reddened. &#x201c;You haven&#x2019;t heard the last of this, Dofine.&#x201d;<br><br>Dofine&#x2019;s mouth approximated a smile. &#x201c;Ah, once again, you are mistaken.&#x201d; Abruptly, he ended the transmission, then swung back to face his fellow Neimoidian. &#x201c;Inform me when the loading process is concluded.&#x201d;<br><br>Deep in the hangar arms, droids supervised the disposition of the cargo pods from traffic stations located high above the deck. Humpbacked craft with bulbous noses that gave them an animated appearance, the pods entered through the hangars&#x2019; magcon orifices on repulsorlift power and were routed according to contents and destination, as designated by codes stenciled on the hulls. Each hangar arm was divided into three zones, partitioned by sliding bulkhead doors, twenty stories high. Normally, zone three, closest to the centersphere, was filled first. But pods containing goods bound for destinations other than Coruscant or other Core worlds were directed to berthing bays in zones one or two, regardless of when they were brought aboard.<br><br>Scattered throughout the hangars were security automata toting modified BlasTech combat rifles, some with dispersal tips. Where the worker droids might be hollow-bodied asps, limber-necked PKs, boxy GNKs, or flat-footed binary loadlifters, the security droids appeared to have been inspired by the skeletal structure of any number of the galaxy&#x2019;s bipedal life-forms.<br><br>Lacking both the rounded head and alloy musculature of its near cousin, the protocol droid, the security droid had a narrow, half-cylindrical head that tapered forward to a speech processor and, at the opposite end, curved down over a stiff, backwardly canted neck. What distinguished the droid, however, was its signal boost backpack and the retractable antennae that sprouted from it.<br><br>The majority of the droids that comprised the Revenue&#x2019;s security force were simply appendages of the freighter&#x2019;s central control computer, but a few had been equipped with a small measure of intelligence. The foreheads and chest plastrons of these lanky commanders were emblazoned with yellow markings similar to military unit flashes, though less for the sake of other droids than for the flesh and bloods to whom the commanders ultimately answered.<br><br>OLR-4 was one such commander.<br><br>Blaster rifle gripped in both hands and angled across his chest, the droid stood in zone two of the ship&#x2019;s starboard hangar arm, halfway between the bulkheads that defined the immense space. OLR-4 was aware of the activity around him&#x2014;the current of cargo pods moving toward zone three, the noise of other pods settling to the deck, the incessant whirrs and clicks of machines in motion&#x2014;but only in a vague way. Rather, OLR-4 had been tasked by the central control computer to watch for anything out of the ordinary&#x2014;for any event that fell outside performance parameters defined by the computer itself.</p><h2>Penetration Testing: A Hands-On Introduction to Hacking</h2><p>Penetration testers simulate cyber attacks to find security weaknesses in networks, operating systems, and applications.

He was known for his innovations, including "built-ins" for streamlined kitchen work, for introducing a multipurpose room adjacent to the kitchen, and for the classic atrium that melded the indoors with the outdoors. For nearly twenty years, Eichler Homes built thousands of dwellings in California, acquiring national and international acclaim. Eichler: Modernism Rebuilds the American Dream examines Eichler's legacy as seen in his original homes and in the revival of the Modernist movement, which continues to grow today. The homes that Eichler built were modern in concept and expression, and yet comfortable for living. Eichler's work left a legacy of design integrity and set standards for housing developers that remain unparalleled in the history of American building. This book captures and illustrates that legacy with impressive detail, engaging history, firsthand recollections about Eichler and his vision, and 250 photographs of Eichler homes in their prime.</p> <p>Paul Adamson, AIA, holds a Master of Architecture degree from Columbia University and has practiced in New York and San Francisco. He is currently a designer at the San Francisco firm of Hornberger + Worstell, Inc. He lives in Kensington, California.</p> <p>Marty Arbunich is director-publisher of the Eichler Network, a Bay Area-based company devoted exclusively to supporting and preserving the architecture and lifestyle surrounding California's 11,000 Eichler homes. He lives in San Francisco.</p></p><p><p>Joseph Eichler was a pioneering developer of residential suburbs whose socially conscious ethic progressive planning, and elegant modern design for moderately priced housing in California still serves as a standard for housing developments today. Defying conventional building industry wisdom by hiring a group of progressive architects to plan subdivisions and design reasonably priced homes, Eichler provided more than 11,000 residences that helped meet the dramatic need for post-World War II housing with extraordinary commodity and style.</p> <p>Through the 1950s and sixties, Eichler Homes gained national and international acclaim for its innovative yet affordable features. Eichler and his architects improved family living when they initiated flexible open planning and built-in furnishings that reformed traditional rooms. The kitchen opened onto a "multipurpose room" (the forerunner of today's great room); the living and dining rooms were combined, and often used to separate the children's rooms from the parents' room; and a central atrium brought the ambient joys of the Californian climate inside while expanding interior vistas.</p> <p>Eichler's social conscience inspired him to confront prevailing business and political trends that promoted racism and discouraged creative land use. His subdivisions, recalling the planning ideas of Clarence Stein, were based on village concepts, and he publicly declared a policy of nondiscrimination.</p> <p>Fifties-era photographs capture the now-classic style that introduced middle-class families to a modern way of life. Popular today, as they were then, the Eichler homes represent a legacy of design integrity and demonstrate a level of quality for residential development that remains unparalleled in the history of American building.</p><p>Atriums, household conveniences, and sleek styling made Eichler Homes a standard-bearer for bringing modern home design to middle-class America.</p></p><h2>Das Boot: The Boat</h2><p>The thrilling wartime novel that inspired Wolfgang Petersen's Academy Award-nominated, blockbuster film! Written by an actual survivor of Germany's U-boat fleet,<i> Das Boot</i> is one of the most exciting stories of naval warfare ever published, a tale filled with almost unbearable tension and suspense. In autumn 1941, a German U-boat commander and his crew set out on yet another hazardous patrol in the Battle of the Atlantic. Over the coming weeks they brave the ocean's stormy waters and seek out British supply ships to destroy. But their targets travel in well-guarded convoys. When contact finally occurs, the hunter quickly becomes the hunted, and a cat-and-mouse game begins as the U-boat hides deep beneath the surface of the sea. Soon, claustrophobia becomes an enemy almost as frightening as the depth charges exploding around them. The release of this supremely gripping, merciless intense story commemorates the 60th anniversary of the outbreak of World War II.<br></p><p><b>Lothar-Gunther Buchheim </b>joined the navy when World War II broke out, and served on mine-sweepers, destroyers, and submarines, on the last as an official navy correspondent.</p><h2>The Duel: The Parallel Lives of Alexander Hamilton and Aaron Burr</h2><p><b>Learn more about the men who inspired Hamilton: The Musical in this fascinating look at the historical friends turned revolutionary rivals!</b><br><br>In curiously parallel lives, Alexander Hamilton and Aaron Burr were both orphaned at an early age. Both were brilliant students who attended college--one at Princeton, the other at Columbia--and studied law. Both were young staff officers under General George Washington, and both became war heroes. Politics beckoned them, and each served in the newly formed government of the fledgling nation. Why, then, did these two face each other at dawn in a duel that ended with death for one and harsh criticism for the other?<p>Judith St. George's lively biography, told in alternating chapters, brings to life two complex men who played major roles in the formation of the United States.<br><br></p></p><p>Judith St. George has published dozens of successful nonfiction books for children, including the Caldecott Medal-winning&nbsp;<i>So You Want to Be President?</i>&nbsp;and the historical Turning Point series, including&nbsp;<i>You&#x2019;re On Your Way, Teddy Roosevelt</i>;&nbsp;<i>Stand Tall, Abe Lincoln</i>; and&nbsp;<i>Take the Lead, George Washington</i>. You can visit her online at www.judithstgeorge.com.Starred Review. Grade 5-9&#x2013;Early in the morning on June 11, 1804, Aaron Burr shot and killed Alexander Hamilton. Both men were prominent citizens of the infant United States of America&#x2013;Burr, indeed, was the vice president&#x2013;but while Hamilton was lionized, Burr was vilified for the rest of his life. Interestingly, this marked the parting of ways in two lives that were remarkably similar. Both men had been orphaned young; both were excellent, driven students; both men had served on the staff of General George Washington during the Revolutionary War; both were lawyers in New York City; and both were deeply involved in politics. In the course of 25 years, their life paths crossed time and again, culminating in a tragic duel, as senseless as it was damaging for both parties. St. George does an excellent job of presenting the stories of the two men, informed by particulars that give a sense of character as well as of the historical milieu. Readers who like historical fiction will find this equally intriguing and approachable. The nine chapters, chronologically organized and compellingly written, move along smoothly to the inevitable, but still distressing, end. Similar in content to Dennis Brindell Fradin's excellent <i>Duel! Burr and Hamilton's Deadly War of Words</i> (Walker, 2008), St. George's book has a bit more background on both men. Given its illustrative content, Fradin's title will move better with younger readers, but most collections could use both volumes.<i>&#x2013;Ann Welton, Helen B.

The author of this ground-breaking book believes he was. "Caesar&#x2019;s Messiah" reveals the key to a new and revolutionary understanding of the origin of Christianity, explaining what is the New Testament, who is the real Jesus, and how Christ's second coming already occurred. The clues leading to these startling conclusions are found in the writings of the first-century historian Flavius Josephus, whose "Wars of the Jews" is one of the only historical chronicles of this period. Closely comparing the work of Josephus with the New Testament Gospels, "Caesar&#x2019;s Messiah" demonstrates that the Romans directed the writing of both. Their purpose: to offer a vision of a &#x201c;peaceful Messiah&#x201d; who would serve as an alternative to the revolutionary leaders who were rocking first-century Israel and threatening Rome. Similarly, "Caesar&#x2019;s Messiah" will rock our understanding of Christian history as it reveals that Jesus was a fictional character portrayed in four Gospels written not by Christians but Romans. This Flavian Signature edition adds Atwill&#x2019;s latest discoveries of numerous parallel events in sequence which ultimately reveal the identity of the true authors of the Gospels.</p><p>"Challenging and provocative. If what Joseph Atwill is saying is only partially true, we are looking into the abyss."&nbsp; -- Robert Eisenman, author of "James the Brother of Jesus"<br> <br> Was Jesus the invention of a Roman emperor? The author of this ground-breaking book believes he was. "Caesar's Messiah" reveals the key to a new and revolutionary understanding of Christian origins.<br> <br> The clues leading to its startling conclusions are found in the writings of the first-century historian Flavius Josephus, whose "War of the Jews" is one of the only historical chronicles of this period.

This Flavian Signature edition adds Atwill's latest discoveries of numerous parallel events in sequence, which ultimately reveal the identity of the true authors of the Gospels.Joseph Atwill began his religious studies as a youth in Japan at the only English-speaking school in the country, the Jesuit-run St. Mary's Military Academy. The majority of each of his school days was spent studying Greek, Latin, and the Bible, which he found fascinating, although he eventually drifted away from the faith. Having studied computer science in college, Atwill formed a series of successful companies with one of the most renowned programmers in the world, David Ferguson. Many years later, the sale of his interests in these companies allowed him to return to his earlier interest &#x2013; the origins of Christianity. He spent over a decade studying hundreds of books, among them, the works of Robert Eisenman and the Dead Sea Scrolls. Together with Eisenman, Atwill wrote a paper on the dating of the Dead Sea Scrolls. While studying the two most prominent works of the 1st century - Josephus&#x2019; "Wars of the Jews" and the Gospels - Atwill noticed a series of parallels occurring in sequence between the military campaign of the Roman Caesar Titus Flavius and the ministry of Jesus. His findings led him to a startling new conclusion about the origins of Christianity - that a Roman imperial family, the Flavians, had created Christianity to pacify the Jews&#x2019; rebellion against Rome, and even more incredibly, they had placed a literary satire within the Gospels and "Wars of the Jews" to inform posterity of this fact. The results of Atwill&#x2019;s research are set out in his book "Caesar&#x2019;s Messiah". The second edition of "Caesar&#x2019;s Messiah", Ulysses Press 2006, became the best selling work of religious history in the US in 2007, and its German translation "Das Messias Ratsel", Ulstein 2008, achieved #1 Best Seller status. The Flavian Signature edition of "Caesar&#x2019;s Messiah", CreateSpace 2011, adds the most detailed presentation of the parallels Atwill discovered between the works of Josephus and the Book of Luke.</p><h2>Quantum Success: The Astounding Science of Wealth and Happiness</h2><p>What would you do if you could really achieve all that you desire?

R. Ward brings together two of the most beloved people in the Black Dagger Brotherhood world&#x2014;at last....</b><br> &nbsp;<br> Qhuinn, son of no one, is used to being on his own. Disavowed from his bloodline, shunned by the aristocracy, he has found an identity as a brutal fighter in the war against the Lessening Society. But his life is not complete. Even as the prospect of having a family of his own seems within reach, he is empty on the inside, his heart given to another....<br> &nbsp;<br> Blay, after years of unrequited love, has moved on from his feelings for Qhuinn. And it&#x2019;s about time: it seems Qhuinn has found his perfect match in a Chosen female, and they are going to have a young. It&#x2019;s hard for Blay to see the new couple together, but building your life around a pipe dream is just a heartbreak waiting to happen. And Qhuinn needs to come to terms with some dark things before he can move forward...<br><br> Fate seems to have taken these vampire soldiers in different directions, but as the battle over the race&#x2019;s throne intensifies, and new players on the scene in Caldwell create mortal danger for the Brotherhood, Qhuinn learns the true meaning of courage, and two hearts meant to be together finally become one.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><b>J.R. Ward </b>is the #1 <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author of numerous novels, including the Black Dagger Brotherhood series. She lives in the South with her family.<p>PRELUDE</p><p>Qhuinn, son of Lohstrong, entered his family&#x2019;s home through its grand front door. The instant he stepped over the threshold, the smell of the place curled up into his nose. Lemon polish. Beeswax candles. Fresh flowers from the garden that the <i>doggen</i> brought in daily. Perfume&#x2014;his mother&#x2019;s. Cologne&#x2014;his father&#x2019;s and his brother&#x2019;s. Cinnamon gum&#x2014;his sister&#x2019;s.</p><p>If the Glade company ever did an air freshener like this, it would be called something like Meadow of Old Money. Or Sunrise over a Fat Bank Account.</p><p>Or maybe the ever-popular We&#x2019;re Just Better Than Everyone Else.</p><p>Distant voices drifted over from the dining room, the vowels round as brilliant-cut diamonds, the consonants drawled out smooth and long as satin ribbons.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, Lillie, this is lovely, thank you,&#x201d; his mother said to the server. &#x201c;But that&#x2019;s too much for me. And do not give Solange so all that. She&#x2019;s getting heavy.&#x201d;</p><p>Ah, yes, his mother&#x2019;s perma-diet inflicted on the next generation: <i>Glymera</i> females were supposed to disappear from sight when they turned sideways, each jutting collarbone, sunken cheek, and bony upper arm some kind of fucked-up badge of honor.</p><p>As if resembling like a fire poker would make you a better person.</p><p>And Scribe Virgin forefend if your daughter looked like she was healthy.</p><p>&#x201c;Ah, yes, thank you, Lilith,&#x201d; his father said evenly. &#x201c;More for me, please.&#x201d;</p><p>Qhuinn closed his eyes and tried to convince his body to step forward. One foot after another. It was not that tough.</p><p>His brandy-new Ed Hardy kicks middle-fingered that suggestion. Then again, in so many ways, walking into that dining room was belly-of-the-beast time.</p><p>He let his duffel fall to the floor. The couple of days at his best friend Blay&#x2019;s house had done him good, a break from the complete lack of air in this house. Unfortunately, the burn on reentry was so bad, the cost-benefit of leaving was nearly equal.</p><p>Okay, this was ridiculous. He couldn&#x2019;t keep standing here like an inanimate object.</p><p>Turning to the side wall, he leaned into the full-length antique mirror that was placed right by the door. So thoughtful. So in keeping with the aristocracy&#x2019;s need to look good. This way, visitors could check their hair and clothes as the butler accepted coats and hats.</p><p>The young pretrans face that stared back at him was all even features, good jawline, and a mouth that, he had to admit, looked like it could do some serious damage to naked skin when he got older. Or maybe that was just wishful thinking. Hair was Vlad the Impaler, spikes standing up straight from his head. Neck was strung with a bike chain&#x2014;and not one bought at Urban Outfitters, but the link that had previously motivated his twelve-speed.</p><p>All things being equal, he looked like a thief who had broken in and was prepared to trash the place on the hunt for sterling silver, jewelry, and portable electronics.</p><p>The irony was that the Goth bullcrap wasn&#x2019;t actually the most offensive part of his appearance to his fam. In fact, he could have stripped down, hung a light fixture off his ass, and run around the first floor playing Jose Canseco with the art and antiques and not come close to how much the real problem pissed off his parents.</p><p>It was his eyes.</p><p>One blue. One green.</p><p>Oopsy. His bad.</p><p>The <i>glymera</i> didn&#x2019;t like defects. Not in their porcelain or their rose gardens. Not in their wallpaper or their carpets or their countertops. Not in the silk of their underwear or the wool of their blazers or the chiffon of their gowns.</p><p>And certainly not <i>ever</i> in their children.</p><p>Sister was okay&#x2014;well, except for the &#x201c;little weight problem&#x201d; that didn&#x2019;t actually exist, and a lisp that her transition hadn&#x2019;t cured &#x2014;oh, and the fact that she had the personality of their mother. And there was no fixing that shit. Brother, on the other hand, was the real fucking star, a physically perfect, firstborn son prepared to carry forth the family bloodline by reproducing in a very genteel, non-moaning, no-sweat situation with a female chosen for him by the family.</p><p>Hell, his sperm recipient had already been lined up. He was going to mate her as soon as he went through his transition&#x2014;</p><p>&#x201c;How are you feeling, my son?&#x201d; his father asked with hesitation.</p><p>&#x201c;Tired, sir,&#x201d; a deep voice answered. &#x201c;But this is going to help.&#x201d;</p><p>A chill frog-marched up Qhuinn&#x2019;s spine. That didn&#x2019;t sound like his brother. Way too much bass. Far too masculine. Too...</p><p>Holy shit, the guy had gone through his transition.</p><p>Now Qhuinn&#x2019;s Ed Hardys got with the program, taking him forward until he could see into the dining room. Father was in his seat at the head of the table. Check. Mother was in her seat at the foot of the table opposite the kitchen&#x2019;s flap door. Check. Sister was facing out of the room, all but licking the gold rim off her plate from hunger. Check.</p><p>The male whose back was to Qhuinn was not part of the SOP.</p><p>Luchas was twice the size he&#x2019;d been when Qhuinn had been approached by a <i>doggen</i> and told to get his things and go to Blay&#x2019;s.</p><p>Well, that explained the vacay. He&#x2019;d assumed his father had finally relented and given in to the request Qhuinn had filed weeks before. But nope, the guy had just wanted Qhuinn out of the house because the change had come to the gene pool&#x2019;s golden child.</p><p>Had his brother laid the chick? Who had they used for blood&#x2014;</p><p>His father, never the demonstrative type, reached out a hand and gave Luchas an awkward pat on the forearm. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re so proud of you. You look...perfect.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You do,&#x201d; Qhuinn&#x2019;s mother piped up. &#x201c;Just perfect. Doesn&#x2019;t your brother look perfect, Solange?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, he does. Perfect.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And I have something for you,&#x201d; Lohstrong said.</p><p>The male reached into the inside pocket of his sport coat and took out a black velvet box the size of a baseball.</p><p>Qhuinn&#x2019;s mother started to tear up and dabbed under her eyes.</p><p>&#x201c;This is for you, my precious son.&#x201d;</p><p>The box was slid across the white damask tablecloth, and his brother&#x2019;s now-big hands shook as he took the thing and popped the lid.</p><p>Qhuinn caught the flash of gold all the way out in the foyer.</p><p>As everyone at the table went silent, his brother stared at the signet ring, clearly overwhelmed, as their mother kept up with the dab-dab, and even their father grew misty. And his sister sneaked a roll from the bread basket.</p><p>&#x201c;Thank you, sir,&#x201d; Luchas said as he put the heavy gold ring on his forefinger.</p><p>&#x201c;It fits, does it not?&#x201d; Lohstrong asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, sir. Perfectly.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We wear the same size, then.&#x201d;</p><p>Of course they did.</p><p>At that moment, their father glanced away, like he was hoping the movement of his eyeballs would take care of the sheen of tears that had come over his vision.</p><p>He caught Qhuinn lurking outside the dining room.</p><p>There was a brief flash of recognition. Not the hi-how&#x2019;re-ya kind, or the oh-good-my-other-son&#x2019;s-home. More like when you were walking through the grass and noticed a pile of dog shit too late to stop your foot from landing in it.</p><p>The male went back to staring at his family, locking Qhuinn out.</p><p>Clearly, the last thing Lohstrong wanted was such a historic moment to be ruined&#x2014;and that was probably why he didn&#x2019;t do the hand signals that warded off the evil eye. Usually everyone in the household performed the ritual when they saw Qhuinn. Not tonight. Daddio didn&#x2019;t want the others to know.</p><p>Qhuinn went over to his duffel. Slinging the weight onto his shoulder, he took the front stairs to his room. Usually his mother preferred him to use the servants&#x2019; set, but that would mean he&#x2019;d have to cut through all the love in there.</p><p>His room was as far away from the others&#x2019; as you could get, all the way over to the right. He&#x2019;d often wondered why they didn&#x2019;t take the leap completely and put him in with the <i>doggen</i>&#x2014;but then the staff would probably quit.</p><p>Closing himself in, he dumped his duds on the bare floor and sat on his bed. Staring at his only piece of luggage, he figured he had better do that laundry soon, as there was a wet bathing suit in there.</p><p>The maids refused to touch his clothes&#x2014;like the evil in him lingered in the fibers of his jeans and his T-shirts. The upside was, he was never welcome at formal events, so his wardrobe was just wash-&#x2019;n&#x2019;-wear, baby&#x2014;</p><p>He discovered he was crying when he looked down at his Ed Hardys and realized that there were a couple of drops of water right in the middle of the laces.</p><p>Qhuinn was never getting a ring.</p><p>Ah, hell...this hurt.</p><p>He was scrubbing his face with his palms when his phone rang. Taking the thing out of his biker jacket, he had to blink a couple of times to focus.</p><p>He hit <i>send</i> to accept the call, but he didn&#x2019;t answer.</p><p>&#x201c;I just heard,&#x201d; Blay said across the connection. &#x201c;How are you doing?&#x201d;</p><p>Qhuinn opened his mouth to reply, his brain coughing up all kinds of responses: &#x201c;Peachy fucking jim-dandy.&#x201d; &#x201c;At least I&#x2019;m not &#x2018;fat&#x2019; like my sister.&#x201d; &#x201c;No, I don&#x2019;t know if my brother got laid.&#x201d;</p><p>Instead, he said, &#x201c;They got me out of the house. They didn&#x2019;t want me to curse the transition. Guess it worked, because the guy looks like he came through it okay.&#x201d;</p><p>Blay swore softly.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, and he got his ring just now. My father gave him...his ring.&#x201d;</p><p>The signet ring with the family crest on it, the symbol that all males of good bloodlines wore to attest to the value of their lineage.</p><p>&#x201c;I watched Luchas put it on his finger,&#x201d; Qhuinn said, feeling as if he were taking a sharp knife and drawing it up the insides of his arms. &#x201c;Fit perfectly. Looked great. You know, though...like, how could it not&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>He began weeping at that point.</p><p>Just fucking lost it.</p><p>The awful truth was that under his counterculture fuck-you, he wanted his family to love him. As prissy as his sister was, as scholar-geek as his brother was, as reserved as his parents were, he saw the love among the four of them. He <i>felt</i> the love among them. It was the tie that bound those individuals together, the invisible string from one heart to the another, the commitment of caring about everything from the mundane shit to any true, mortal drama. And the only thing more powerful than that connection...was what it was like to get shut out from it.</p><p>Every fucking day of your life.</p><p>Blay&#x2019;s voice cut in through the heaving. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m here for you. And I&#x2019;m so damned sorry....I&#x2019;m here for you....Just don&#x2019;t do anything stupid, okay? Let me come over&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>Leave it to Blay to know that he was thinking about things that involved ropes and showerheads.</p><p>In fact, his free hand had already gone down to the makeshift belt he&#x2019;d fashioned out of a nice, strong weave of nylon&#x2014;because his parents didn&#x2019;t give him much money for clothes, and the proper one he&#x2019;d owned had broken years ago.</p><p>Pulling the length free, he glanced across to the closed door of his bath. All he needed to do was tie the thing to the fixture in his shower&#x2014;God knew those water pipes had been run in the good old days, when things were strong enough to hold some weight. He even had a chair he could stand up on and then kick out from underneath him.</p><p>&#x201c;I gotta go&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Qhuinn? Don&#x2019;t you hang up on me&#x2014;don&#x2019;t you dare hang up on me&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Listen, man, I gotta go&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m coming over right now.&#x201d; Lot of flapping in the background, like Blay was getting his clothes on. &#x201c;Qhuinn! Do not hang up the phone&#x2014;<i>Qhuinn...!</i>&#x201d;</p><p>ONE</p><p>PRESENT DAY</p><p>&#x201c;Now, <i>that</i> a muthafuckn&#x2019; whip rite chur.&#x201d;</p><p>Jonsey looked over at the idiot who was hunkered down next to him in the bus stop. The pair of them had been parked in the Plexiglas gerbil cage for three hours. At least. Although comments like that had made it seem a matter of days.</p><p>And were going to make shit justifiable homicide.</p><p>&#x201c;You a white boy, you know that?&#x201d; Jonsey pointed out.</p><p>&#x201c;Say whaaaaat?&#x201d;</p><p>Okay, make that three years of waiting. &#x201c;Caucasian, dude. As in you need fuckin&#x2019; sunblock in the summer. As in not like m&#x2019;self&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Whatever, man, check out that ride&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;As in why you gotta talk like you from the &#x2019;hood? You act a fool, yo.&#x201d;</p><p>At this point, he just wanted to get the night over. It was cold, it was snowing, and he had to wonder who he&#x2019;d pissed off to get stuck with Vanilla Ice over here.</p><p>Matter of fact, he was thinking about pulling out of this bullshit altogether. He was making good paper dealing in Caldwell; he was two months out of prison for those murders he&#x2019;d done as a juvie; the last thing he was interested in was hanging with some white bitch determined to get street cred through vocabulary.</p><p>Oh, and then there was the Richie Rich neighborhood they were in. For all he knew, there was an ordinance out here that you weren&#x2019;t allowed on the streets after ten p.m.</p><p>Why the <i>hell</i> had he agreed to this?</p><p>&#x201c;Will. You. Please. Look. At. That. Fine. Automobile.&#x201d;</p><p>Just to shut the guy up, Jonsey turned his head and leaned out of the shelter. As blowing snow got into his eyes, he cursed. Fucking upstate New York in the winter. Cold enough to ice-cube your balls&#x2014;</p><p>Well...hello, there.</p><p>Across a shallow parking lot, sitting right in front of a sparkling-clean, no-graffiti&#x2019;d, twenty-four-hour CVS, there was, in fact, a sweet-ass fucking whip. The Hummer was totally blacked out, no chrome anywhere&#x2014;not on the wheels, not around the windows, not even on the grille. And it was the big-body&#x2014;and, going by all that trim, no doubt had the big engine in it.</p><p>The ride was the kind of thing you&#x2019;d see on the streets where he was from, the vehicle of a major dealer. Except they were far from the inner city out here, so it was just some cracker trying to look like he had a dick.</p><p>Vanilla-man hiked up his backpack, one-strapping it. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ma check it out.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Bus is coming soon.&#x201d; Jonsey checked his watch, and did some wishful thinking. &#x201c;Five, maybe ten minutes.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Come on&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Bye, asshole.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You scared or some shit?&#x201d; The SOB lifted his hands and started going <i>Paranormal Activity</i>. &#x201c;Oh, scurrrrrry&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>Jonsey outted his gun and punched the muzzle right into that dumb-ass face. &#x201c;I got no problem killin&#x2019; you right here. I done it before. I do it again. Now back the fuck off and do y&#x2019;self a favor. Shut the fuck up.&#x201d;</p><p>As Jonsey met the guy&#x2019;s eyes, he didn&#x2019;t particularly care what the outcome was. Shoot the bitch. Don&#x2019;t shoot him. Whatever.</p><p>&#x201c;Okay, okay, okay.&#x201d; Mr. Chatty backed away and left the bus stop.</p><p>Thank. Fuck.</p><p>Jonesy put his gat away, crossed his arms, and stared in the direction the bus was going to come out of&#x2014;like that might help.</p><p>Stupid fucking idiot.</p><p>He looked at his watch again. Man, enough with this shit. If a bus heading back into downtown got here first, he was just going to get on and fuck it all.</p><p>Shifting the backpack he&#x2019;d been told to get, he felt the hard contour of the jar inside. The pack he understood. If he was going to transport product from the sticks into the &#x2019;hood, then yeah. But the jar? What the hell you need that for?</p><p>Unless it was loose powder?</p><p>The fact that he&#x2019;d been chosen by C-Rider, the man himself, for this had been pretty fucking cool. Until he&#x2019;d met White Boy&#x2014;and then the idea he was special lost some juice. The boss man&#x2019;s instructions had been clear: Hook up with the dude at the Fourth Street stop. Take the last bus out to the &#x2019;burbs and wait. Transfer to the rural line when service resumed near dawn. Get off at the Warren County stop. Hoof it one mile to a farm property.</p><p>C-Rider would meet them and a bunch of other dudes out there for the business. And after that? Jonsey would be part of a new crew set to dominate the scene in Caldie.</p></p><h2>On Becoming a Person: A Therapist&#39;s View of Psychotherapy</h2><p>In this book one of America&#39;s most distinguished psychologists describes his experiences in helping people to discover the path to personal growth through an understanding of their own limitations and potential. What is personal growth? Under what conditions is it possible? How can one person help another? What is creativity, and how can it be fostered? These are some of the issues raised, which challenge many concepts of traditional psychology. Contemporary psychology derives largely from the experimental laboratory, or from Freudian theory. It is preoccupied with minute aspects of animal and human behaviour, or with the mentally ill. But there are rebels, of whom the author counts himself as one, along with Gordon Allport, Abraham Maslow and Rollo May, who feel that psychology and psychiatry should be aiming higher, and be more concerned with growth and potentiality in man. The interest of such a psychology is in the production of harmoniously mature individuals, given that we all have qualities and possibilities infinitely capable of development. Successful development makes us more flexible in relationships, more creative, and less open to suggestion and control. This book, philosophical and provocative, summarizes Dr Rogers&#39; experience.Non-technical in its language, it is not only for psychologists and psychiatrists, but for teachers and counsellors, religious and social workers, labour-management specialists and anyone interested in &#39;becoming&#39;.</p><p>Carl Rogers was Professor of Psychology and Psychiatry at the University of Wisconsin and Head of the Psychotherapy Research Section of the Psychiatric Institute. He was active in the practice of psychotherapy for over thirty years, and the originator of what is called &#39;client-centred&#39; therapy. He died in 1987.&#34;Deeply insightful . . . Roger&#39;s phenomenal text On Becoming a Person has highlighted to me the importance of the relationship between counselor and client within the person-centered approach.&#34; ---Health Psychology Consultancy</p><h2>Predators: Pedophiles, Rapists, And Other Sex Offenders</h2><p>What motivates sexual abusers? Why are so few caught? Drawing on the stories of abusers, Anna C. Salter shows that sexual predators use sophisticated deception techniques and rely on misconceptions surrounding them to evade discovery. Arguing that even the most knowledgeable among us can be fooled, Salter dispels the myths about sexual predators and gives us the tools to protect our families and ourselves.</p><p><b>Anna C. Salter, Ph.D.</b>, lectures and consults throughout the U.S. and abroad, and in 1997 won the Significant Achievement Award from the Association for the Treatment of Sexual Abusers. She is the author of Treating Child Sex Offenders and Victims, Transforming Trauma, and several forensic mysteries. She lives in Madison, Wisconsin.Salter, known for such novels as White Lies, offers a direct and startling look at the alarming problem of sexual predators in the U.S. Drawing on her experience counseling victims and offenders, she creates a daunting picture for the readers. "This is not a book with complete and comfortable answers. It will not finish with a checklist for identifying a sex offender.... But if I do my job right, reading this book will make it harder for sex offenders to get access to you or your children," she says in her introduction. Despite some much publicized media cases, Salter believes there are many misunderstandings about sexual predators. Most of the crimes are premeditated and carefully planned, and fewer than 5% of sexual predators are caught. With anecdotes and case histories, Salter examines such various predators as rapists and child molesters. Then, she goes on to offer some specific strategies to avoid high-risk situations. These tactics consist of monitoring children, even teens, on the Internet; carrying a cell phone; using home security systems, etc. The descriptions of violent attacks and victims' experience will undoubtedly unnerve readers. However, the subject matter is likely to appeal more to police or psychology professionals. The strategies the author offers for readers are usually fairly obvious. While sexual crimes may be on the increase, readers may see this book as necessary only after they've been victimized rather than as a preventive guide. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Man Called Intrepid: The Incredible WWII Narrative Of The Hero Whose Spy Network And Secret Diplomacy Changed The Course Of History</h2><p><p>A classic about real-life WWII espionage, as conducted by its modern master</p><p> </p><p>*</p><p> </p><p><em>A Man Called Intrepid</em> is the classic true story of Sir William Stephenson (codenamed Intrepid) and the spy network he founded that would ultimately stall the Nazi war machine and help win World War II.

Appointed Assistant Librarian at the Library of Congress&#x2014;at a time when government appointments were the most prestigious positions available for blacks&#x2014;Murray became wealthy through his business as a construction contractor and married a college-educated socialite. The Murrays&#x2019; social circles included some of the first African-American U.S. Senators and Congressmen, and their children went to the best colleges&#x2014;Harvard and Cornell.</p><p>Though Murray and other black elite of his time were primed to assimilate into the cultural fabric as Americans first and people of color second, their prospects were crushed by Jim Crow segregation and the capitulation to white supremacist groups by the government, which turned a blind eye to their unlawful&#x2014;often murderous&#x2014;acts. Elizabeth Dowling Taylor traces the rise, fall, and&nbsp;disillusionment of upper-class African Americans, revealing that they were a representation not of hypothetical achievement but what could be realized by African Americans through education and equal opportunities. </p><p>As she makes clear, these well-educated and wealthy elite were living proof that African Americans did not lack ability to fully participate in the social contract as white supremacists claimed, making their subsequent fall when Reconstruction was prematurely abandoned all the more tragic. Illuminating and powerful, her magnificent work brings to life a dark chapter of American history that too many Americans have yet to recognize.</p></p><p><p>This cultural biography tells the enthralling story of the high-achieving black elites who thrived in the nation&#x2019;s capital during Reconstruction. Daniel Murray (1851&#x2013;1925), an assistant librarian at the Library of Congress, was a prominent member of this glorious class.</p><p>Murray's life was reflective of other African Americans who were accomplished and prosperous during the Reconstruction period. This social circle included educators, ministers, lawyers, doctors, entrepreneurs, US senators and representatives, and other government officials. Among the luminaries were Francis and Archibald Grimk�, Blanche Bruce, Pinckney Pinchback, Robert and Mary Church Terrell, Booker T. Washington, and W. E. B. Du Bois. The elite were primed to assimilate into the cultural fabric as Americans first and people of color second. Education was a pearl of great pride, and they sent their children to the best schools&#x2014;Phillips Academy, Cornell, and Harvard. They belonged to exclusive clubs, cultivated genteel manners, owned opulent homes, threw elaborate parties, dressed to the nines, and summered in special enclaves.</p><p>But the rug was pulled from under all African Americans when they were betrayed by the federal government as the cost of reconciliation with the South. In response to renewed oppression, Murray and others in his class fought back, establishing themselves as inspiring race activists. Elizabeth Dowling Taylor&#x2019;s powerful work brings to light a dark chapter of race relations that too many have yet to own.</p><p><strong>Elizabeth Dowling Taylor</strong> is the <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author of <em>A Slave in the White House: Paul Jennings and the Madisons</em>.

As we become the distant past, you become a future few of us would have imagined.<br><br>It's hard to think of such things when you are busy dreaming or loving or screwing. The context falls away. We are a spirit-burden you carry, like that of your grandparents, or the friends from your childhood who at some point moved away. We try to make it as light a burden as possible. And at the same time, when we see you, we cannot help but think of ourselves. We were once the ones who were dreaming and loving and screwing. We were once the ones who were living, and then we were the ones who were dying. We sewed ourselves, a thread's width, into your history.<br><br>We were once like you, only our world wasn't like yours.<br><br>You have no idea how close to death you came. A generation or two earlier, you might be here with us.<br><br>We resent you. You astonish us.<br><br>It's 8:07 on a Friday night, and right now Neil Kim is thinking of us. He is fifteen, and he is walking over to his boyfriend Peter's house. They have been going out for a year, and Neil starts by thinking about how long this seems. From the beginning, everyone has been telling him it won't last. But now, even if it doesn't last forever, it feels like it has lasted long enough to be meaningful. Peter's parents treat Neil like a second son, and while Neil's own parents are still alternately confused and distressed, they haven't barred any of the doors.<br><br>Neil has two DVDs, two bottles of Diet Dr Pepper, cookie dough, and a book of poems in his backpack. This--and Peter--is all it takes for him to feel profoundly lucky. But luck, we've learned, is actually part of an invisible equation. Two blocks away from Peter's house, Neil gets a glimpse of this, and is struck by a feeling of deep, unnamed gratitude. He realizes that part of his good fortune is his place in history, and he thinks fleetingly of us, the ones who came before. We are not names or faces to him; we are an abstraction, a force. His gratitude is a rare thing--it is much more likely for a boy to feel thankful for the Diet Dr Pepper than he is to feel thankful for being healthy and alive, for being able to walk to his boyfriend's house at age fifteen without any doubt that this is the right thing to do.<br><br>He has no idea how beautiful he is as he walks up that path and rings that doorbell. He has no idea how beautiful the ordinary becomes once it disappears.<br><br>If you are a teenager now, it is unlikely that you knew us well. We are your shadow uncles, your angel godfathers, your mother's or your grandmother's best friend from college, the author of that book you found in the gay section of the library. We are characters in a Tony Kushner play, or names on a quilt that rarely gets taken out anymore. We are the ghosts of the remaining older generation. You know some of our songs.<br><br>We do not want to haunt you too somberly. We don't want our legacy to be gravitas. You wouldn't want to live your life like that, and you won't want to be remembered like that, either. Your mistake would be to find our commonality in our dying. The living part mattered more.<br><br>We taught you how to dance.<br><br>It's true. Look at Tariq Johnson on the dance floor. Seriously--look at him. Six feet three inches tall, one hundred eighty pounds, all of which can be converted by the right clothes and the right song into a mass of heedless joy. (The right hair helps, too.) He treats his body like it's made of fireworks, each one timed to the beat. Is he dancing alone or dancing with everyone in the room? Here's the secret: It doesn't matter. He traveled for two hours to get to the city, and when it's all over, it will take him over two hours to get home. But it's worth it. Freedom isn't just about voting and marrying and kissing on the street, although all of these things are important. Freedom is also about what you will allow yourself to do. We watch Tariq when he's sitting in Spanish class, sketching imaginary maps in his notebook. We watch Tariq when he's sitting in the cafeteria, stealing glances at older boys. We watch Tariq as he lays the clothes on his bed, creating the outline of the person he's going to be tonight. We spent years doing these things. And this was what we looked forward to, the thing that Tariq looks forward to. This liberation.<br><br>Music isn't much different now from what it was when we hit the dance floor. This means something. We found something universal. We bottled that desire, then released it into the airwaves. The sounds hit your body, and you move.<br><br>We are in those particles that send you. We are in that music.<br><br>Dance for us, Tariq.<br><br>Feel us there in your freedom.<br><br>It was an exquisite irony: Just when we stopped wanting to kill ourselves, we started to die. Just when we were feeling strength, it was taken from us.<br><br>This should not happen to you.<br><br>Adults can talk all they want about youth feeling invincible. Surely, some of us had that bravado. But there was also the dark inner voice telling us we were doomed. And then we were doomed. And then we weren't.<br><br>You should never feel doomed.<br><br>It is 8:43 on the same Friday night, and Cooper Riggs is nowhere. He's in his room, alone, and it feels like nowhere. He could be outside his room, surrounded by people, and it would still feel like nowhere. The world, in his eyes, is flat and dull. All sensation has been leaked from it, and instead its energy is running through the busy corridors of his mind, making angry, frustrated noise. He is sitting on his bed, and he is wrestling within himself, and ultimately the only thing he can think to do is go on the Internet, because life there is just as flat as real life, without the expectations of real life. He's only seventeen, but online he can be twenty-two, fifteen, twenty-seven. Whatever the other person wants him to be. He has fake profiles, fake photos, fake stats, and fake histories. The conversations are largely fake, too, full of flirtation he'll never deliver on, small sparks that will never turn to fire. He will not admit it, but he is actually looking for the surprise of something genuine. He opens seven sites at once, keeping his mind busy, tricking himself out of nowhere, even if it still feels like nowhere. He gets so lost in the search that nothing else seems to matter, and time becomes worthless, to be spent on worthless things.<br><br>We know that some of you are still scared. We know that some of you are still silent. Just because it's better now doesn't mean that it's always good.<br><br>Dreaming and loving and screwing. None of these are identities.

We are so much more complicated than that.<br><br>We wish we could offer you a creation myth, an exact reason why you are the way you are, why when you read this sentence, you will know it's about you.

You can plan and strategize and keep your eye on the horizon, watching for trouble. And nothing you can do will protect you from the fact that things might, when you least expect it, go terribly, horribly wrong. If you're anxious about this, it's not like you don't have a reason. If you're very anxious about this, you're certainly not alone. In fact, even if your whole life feels like it's about anxiety, your story is a lot more common that you might imagine.</p> <p>If you could just get your anxiety to go away, you could get on with the business of living your life, right? Well, maybe &#x2014; or maybe not. Does anxiety need to go away in order for you to live your life fully, vitally, with richness and purpose?</p> <p>This book approaches the problem of anxiety a little differently than most. Instead of trying to help you overcome or reduce feelings of anxiety, <em>Things Might Go Terribly, Horribly Wrong</em> will help you climb inside these feelings, sit in that place, and see what it would be like to have anxiety and still make room in your life to breathe and rest and live &#x2014; really and truly live &#x2014; in a way that matters to you.</p> <p>Although it's grounded in a research-supported form of psychotherapy called acceptance and commitment therapy, also known as ACT, <em>Things</em> isn't especially technical or stepwise. Rather, the book starts a conversation about why we all sometimes feel anxious and what role that anxiety serves in our lives. It connects the experience of anxiety to the essential experience of human suffering. And then, in sometimes unexpected ways, <em>Things</em> explores some basic ways of being in the world that can change the role anxiety plays in your life.</p> <p><em>This book has been awarded The Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies Self-Help Seal of Merit &#x2014; an award bestowed on outstanding self-help books that are consistent with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) principles and that incorporate scientifically tested strategies for overcoming mental health difficulties.

These were children, mostly from Central America, who had crossed the border without papers or parents. I spent that spring reporting the story, digging into the massive infrastructure of apprehending, detaining, caring for, and litigating the cases of these thousands of young migrants who, that year, more than tripled their historical annual average. The article, &#x201c;First the Fence, Then the System,&#x201d; came out that June. <br> &nbsp;<br> Since 2006, I&#x2019;d been working with refugees and immigrants in Oakland, California, at various nonprofit agencies and then the Oakland school district. In 2011 I started working at Oakland International High School, a school for newly arrived English-language learners, where I coordinated programs for students and families, such as parent classes, after-school programs, and health and mental health services. Our school had enrolled a few unaccompanied minors over the years, but I understood little about their circumstances and even less about their experiences navigating the immigration system. <br> &nbsp;<br> In the <i>VQR</i> story, I had focused on the children who were caught, but I soon found myself chasing another story: what happened to the children who <i>weren&#x2019;t</i> caught? My story on the growing number of unaccompanied minors working in the California agricultural system, &#x201c;The Lost Boys of California,&#x201d; was published in <i>VICE</i> in March 2014. <br> &nbsp;<br> Just as I was filing the first draft, Mr. David, a co-worker at Oakland International, came into my office to tell me that &#x201c;we really need to do something about all the kids with upcoming court dates.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> <i>What?</i> <br> &nbsp;<br> He explained that a number of our new ninth and tenth graders had been ordered to appear in immigration court in the coming months. The students, who were undocumented and had been apprehended by the authorities after crossing the U.S. border, were almost universally unaccompanied minors, or &#x201c;unaccompanied alien children.&#x201d; They had all been ordered deported and would have to fight in court for the right to stay. They were terrified of court; none of the students David had spoken to had a lawyer. Of the twenty-five or so students he advised, seven were unaccompanied minors. <br> &nbsp;<br> While I had been away reporting on the issue outside Oakland, this population had been surging at my school, the place where I spent four days a week, right under my nose. By spring of 2014, more than sixty unaccompanied minors had enrolled at Oakland International High School, out of a student body of just under four hundred. By the following fall, the number surpassed ninety. In 2017, unaccompanied minors make up over a quarter of Oakland International&#x2019;s student population. <br> &nbsp;<br> After my conversation with David, I spent many an afternoon shepherding kids to pro bono legal agencies and court dates and setting up intake appointments and &#x201c;know your rights&#x201d; information sessions at the school. The students needed counseling and tutoring and doctors&#x2019; appointments; some of them needed help finding homeless shelters and access to food and clothing. Supporting unaccompanied minors quickly became one of my primary responsibilities. <br> &nbsp;<br> In February 2014, I met the Flores twins. (To protect the anonymity of the &#x201c;Flores&#x201d; family, I have changed their names and those of many others who appear in this book, as well as the name of their hometown.)<br> &nbsp;<br> They told me why they had come, but I had so many more questions. What were these children really risking&#x2014;and enduring&#x2014;to come here, and what was the likelihood they would gain the right to stay? Would they really be better off if they did? Were the stories I was hearing overblown, and could I take their reasons for coming to the United States at face value? Answering these questions became a personal imperative, one that would help me better understand my students, my country, and the endless churn of southern migration into the United States. <br> &nbsp;<br> To learn more about the Flores family&#x2019;s story, and that of the hundreds of thousands of migrants like them, I traveled to El Salvador, Mexico, Guatemala, and Texas, reporting from various fulcrums of violence in El Salvador as well as at stations along the migrant trail north. Parts of this book I witnessed myself, and other parts have been reconstructed through extensive reporting and interviews, all in service of investigating the changing dynamics of migration. <br> &nbsp;<br> Since reporting that first article for <i>VQR</i>, I have heard countless stories from young people traveling alone to reach the United States. Every story is different, but there are also striking similarities, often having to do with mounting violence in the children&#x2019;s home countries. These girls and boys are crossing into the United States in search of the fabled &#x201c;better life&#x201d; that has attracted migrants, authorized and unauthorized, since before the <i>Mayflower</i> landed. But in the Northern Triangle&#x2014;Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador&#x2014;a &#x201c;better life,&#x201d; for many, means a life where they are not afraid of being killed. <br> &nbsp;<br> I began reporting this book during the Obama administration, a time rife with anxiety for undocumented migrants. It was completed after the election of Donald Trump, marking an era of unprecedented fear among immigrants and refugees past and present. In a time when immigration is in the daily headlines yet is too often reduced to a matter of binary politics&#x2014;keep them out or let them in, wall or no wall&#x2014;this book seeks to offer a complex understanding of why immigrants leave their country, what struggles they endure to get here, and the challenges they face setting roots in a foreign land. <br> &nbsp;<br> The story of the Flores twins isn&#x2019;t the most harrowing, or the most unjust, or the most extraordinary I&#x2019;ve come across as an educator and a journalist&#x2014;far from it. But something in their story illustrates, roundly and heartbreakingly, the wounds of war, the spirit of a new generation of immigrants, and the impact of migration on the United States as well as on the tiny, time-battered country of El Salvador. <br> &nbsp;<br> The United States is still young and is ever reiterating itself as demanded by its people, both those who have lived here for a long time and those who have just arrived. Immigrants have always shaped our country&#x2019;s future. Young Central Americans are coming here in unprecedented numbers, and how they are or are not received and supported will determine, in part, the next chapter in the American story. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;For a child to choose to make that journey,&#x201d; an advocate told me during my first trip to South Texas, &#x201c;there&#x2019;s a reason.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> Since 2012, hundreds of thousands of minors, paperless and parentless, have crossed into the United States. &#x201c;Why are they coming, and why so many?&#x201d; I wrote in my first piece on unaccompanied minors. It was an earnest question. Every answer raised another question, and the result is this book. It is about who these young men and women are, where they come from, the choices they&#x2019;ve made, and what their stories reveal about who we are as a country, and what we will, or might, become.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Chapter 1<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You boys from eighteen?&#x201d; one of the young men said, pointing his gun toward the retaining wall marked by a small graffito tag: barrio 18. <br> &nbsp;<br> It was 2008. The Flores twins, twelve, were playing poker on the town soccer field with their older brother and six friends when the pickup pulled up. Ten or so guys stood in the truck bed brandishing guns and machetes, sporting hip-hop clothes and tattoos. They were MS-13, or Mara Salvatrucha, the twins knew&#x2014;members of the gang that was then slinking into the small town of La Colonia. The Flores boys and their friends were high on adrenaline from having won a big soccer match that morning, a feeling that mixed nicely with the bravado of early adolescence. But the sight of the armed men scared them silent. <br> &nbsp;<br> They shook their heads no. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I asked you a question!&#x201d; barked the guy in the truck. <br> &nbsp;<br> Ernesto&#x2019;s gaze was lowered, but he could feel the men staring down at him. &#x201c;I asked if you f***ers were from eighteen!&#x201d; the man shouted. At that, one of their friends took off running into the woods. Suddenly&#x2014; they couldn&#x2019;t remember who moved first&#x2014;the twins were sprinting through the forest that flanked the town soccer field, Ernesto first, Ra�l close behind, panting and flying over dips and gullies, pushing past banana trees and crashing through the tall grasses while shouts and a scatter of gunshots crackled behind them. <br> &nbsp;<br> Running away from a truck of gangsters was either an admission of guilt (in this case, allegiance to the rival Barrio 18 gang) or, at the very least, a sign of a lack of respect for MS-13 authority. <br> &nbsp;<br> When the shouts felt far enough away, the twins hit the ground, lying on their bellies in the brush. They stayed there for what felt like several hours&#x2014;until they were sure the truck was gone. They were too scared to go back to the field and look for their cards, which, for anyone <i>vigilando</i>, or keeping watch over the area, might tag the twins as the ones who ran. For a while, at least, no more poker.<br> &nbsp;<br> ---<br> &nbsp;<br> The road to La Colonia is meandering but smooth, thanks to the scant traffic. It weaves through a tangle of greenery: vines overhang concrete walls alongside tall, tight rows of banana trees, diaphanous canopies of <i>barillos</i>, pink flowering cacao, dense <i>cedro negro</i>, and flushing palms. The road begins in a valley and winds upward to where La Colonia, about thirty miles from San Salvador and home to fewer than four thousand people, spreads up and around the slopes of a gentle, low hill. <br> &nbsp;<br> The houses along the road are simple but comfortable, built from concrete, many of them painted colors that were once bright&#x2014;ice blue, cotton candy pink, white with fuchsia trim&#x2014;but that now, with weather and time and dust, have faded. Less fortunate homes speckle back into the adjacent hills and farmland. Flags of the conservative ARENA party flap from electric poles and appear painted on buildings. Along the road stand La Colonia&#x2019;s schools&#x2014;two high schools and an elementary school. One of only about a dozen Flores family photos is of the twins and their older sister, somber-faced and gangly beneath too-big dress clothes, on the proud occasion of their ninth-grade graduation. <br> &nbsp;<br> Cows use the road as often as people do, lashed together by the horns and plodding along between farm and pasture, and dogs warm themselves in the middle of the street looking like splayed corpses. At the sound of approaching cars they rise, shake themselves, and lumber off to where the road turns to dirt. During harvest time, families turn the two-lane road into one as they lay their bean pods and corn out to dry, the kernels spread like a blanched mosaic along the tarmac. <br> &nbsp;<br> The road crests the hill and begins to dip downward, and that&#x2019;s where the Flores home sits, a stone house lined with crumbling stucco. From there it&#x2019;s not much farther to the center of town, a sleepy square rimmed by a block or two of houses and a few businesses&#x2014;family-run restaurants, sundries shops, the mayor&#x2019;s office. The high-rising church is the town&#x2019;s main attraction, its tower wielding a hulking cross that casts a daily shadow into the central square. At noon the church bells chime. <br> &nbsp;<br> Until the twins were teenagers, the town center was frequented day and night. Kids ran around the small playground, people took refuge on the shaded benches, and boys played soccer on the open concrete court, even in the afternoon heat. People came to use the copy shop or buy soap or soda or enter a complaint at the mayor&#x2019;s office. Children who&#x2019;d begged spare change from their parents bought snow cones from the heavyset woman with the mobile stand, the bright, tacky syrup staining their faces. The <i>pupuser�as</i> were open until eleven, midnight even, playing music and serving sodas and beers, the lady proprietors flipping the cakes of corn masa against the griddle until the edges were crispy yellow-brown. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It was a beautiful town,&#x201d; Ra�l remembers. &#x201c;It was.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> ---<br> &nbsp;<br> Like the rest of the farmers in La Colonia, the twins&#x2019; father, Wilber, regarded the mountain and its fertile land as a divine inheritance. The land was good to him; God provided. This was Wilber&#x2019;s credo. &#x201c;The way to survive this world is to stay close to God,&#x201d; he said to his children. &#x201c;And keep <i>manos limpias</i>&#x201d;: clean hands. <br> &nbsp;<br> Wilber carried a small Bible in his pocket at all times, the binding frayed and worn from use. Tucked inside were several prayer cards, his Salvadoran national ID, the photo taken when he was a very young man, and a picture of his bride, Esperanza, now faded and tattered. Every now and then he&#x2019;d pull out the keepsakes to have a look.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;See how young you were!&#x201d; he&#x2019;d say. Esperanza tittered like a girl, waving her hand as if shooing a fly. <br> &nbsp;<br> Wilber and Esperanza had always wanted a big family, but for many years they&#x2019;d felt they might be cursed. They got married in the midst of the country&#x2019;s civil war, in 1985, and when Esperanza gave birth to her first baby, Ricardo, two years later, the war still raged. La Colonia wasn&#x2019;t a hot zone, but soldiers marched through it on occasion. This never meant anything good for poor farmers like the Flores family, whom the government often suspected of being guerrillas. &#x201c;The soldiers came looking for people,&#x201d; Esperanza explained. &#x201c;They could mistake you for someone else and punish you for something they did.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> Once when Wilber was out of town working on another farm&#x2019;s harvest, news spread that the army was on its way. Esperanza snatched up Ricardo, who was barely a year old, and walked out of town up into the hills, where she stayed along with some neighbors for a couple of days, hoping Ricardo didn&#x2019;t cry too loudly. The army passed through without fireworks or massacres. Esperanza came down from the mountain, and they resumed their lives at home. <br> &nbsp;<br> It was a dirty war, as Wilber put it&#x2014;a war between the rightist government, beholden to the country&#x2019;s powerful oligarchy and operating with brute military force, and the mounting leftist guerrilla movement, fighting for the interests of the impoverished working class, especially the country&#x2019;s rural farmers. But the Flores family thought it best to stay out of politics. <br> &nbsp;<br> In cities and in the countryside, mutilated bodies showed up in the streets. Political prisoners&#x2014;dead and alive&#x2014;were heaved off the Devil&#x2019;s Gate cliff in the dense hills above San Salvador. Both sides played dirty, but the government death squads were brutal: a UN-appointed truth commission report asserts, with some contestation from within El Salvador, that 85 percent of the atrocities were carried out by the government. In the early 1980s, the United States traine...</p><h2>Be Wise (1 Corinthians): Discern the Difference Between Man&#39;s Knowledge and God&#39;s Wisdom (The BE Series Commentary)</h2><p><p><b>The early church in Corinth was falling apart.</b> Sin was rampant, divisions were growing, and the congregation was living no differently than the world around them.

While the text remains faithful to the original, the models have been remastered to be more useful to the student and the teacher. Each project consists of a newly-redrawn model along with its accompanying directions. Great care has been given to the readability of the directions, particularly the numbers, both in the text and the diagrams. The book contains models for the first, second, and third year, along with supplementary models for the advanced student. Miss Rich's extremely helpful introduction to the book has been retained, which covers not only the pedagogical foundations for paper sloyd, and the necessary equipment and materials, but also offers guidance to the less-experienced teacher.</p><p><br> Sloyd, which originated in Sweden and then grew popular throughout the world in the late 1800's and early 1900's, has been defined as "tool work so arranged and employed as to stimulate and promote vigorous, intelligent self-activity for a purpose, which the worker recognizes as good." The construction of a concrete product, as a result of careful measurement, attention to detail, and the close reading of instructions has been shown to be important for a child's intellectual development. In the completion of projects and progression through the years, a student will be gradually introduced to mathematical and geometric concepts and will be able to see the relation between a three-dimensional object and its corresponding two-dimensional pattern. Each project builds on the ones that came before, so the student moves from the known to the unknown, the simple to the more complex, and the concrete to the abstract.</p><p>Paper sloyd has the benefit of using easily accessible and inexpensive tools and materials, many of which can already be found in the home. The projects are simple, but designed to be useful and attractive to both the child and the family. And each project is completed entirely by the child, which generates a sense of pride and ownership. Sloyd was practiced in Charlotte Mason schools in the first three elementary grades, and remains a part of the national educational curriculum in several Scandinavian countries to this day.</p><p><br> "Observation is quickened; eyes are trained to see right lines and distances, thus<br> aiding in free-hand drawing and writing; while the hand and wrist muscles, being used for a definite purpose, unconsciously become obedient assistants. Paper sloyd rightly presented justifies itself.

Born in Spokane, Washington, and raised in the Puget Sound area north of Seattle, he received his bachelor of arts degree from Reed College in Portland, Oregon, in 1954, and a master of arts degree from the University of Washington in 1961. He served in the US Army, worked as a buyer for the Boeing Company, and was both a grocery clerk and a college English teacher. He lived in Nevada until his death, at the age of 77.CHAPTER ONE<br><br>It was raining. A soft, silvery drizzle sifted down out of the night sky and wreathed around the blocky watchtowers of the city of Cimmura, hissing in the torches on each side of the broad gate and making the stones of the road leading up to the city shiny and black. A lone rider approached the city. He was wrapped in a dark, heavy traveller&#x2019;s cloak and rode a tall, shaggy roan horse with a long nose and flat, vicious eyes. The traveller was a big man, a bigness of large, heavy bone and ropy tendon rather than of flesh. His hair was coarse and black, and at some time his nose had been broken. He rode easily, but with the peculiar alertness of the trained warrior.<br><br>His name was Sparhawk, a man at least ten years older than he looked, who carried the erosion of his years not so much on his battered face as in a half-dozen or so minor infirmities and discomforts and in the several wide purple scars upon his body which always ached in damp weather. Tonight, however, he felt his age and he wished only for a warm bed in the obscure inn which was his goal. Sparhawk was coming home at last after a decade of being someone else with a different name in a country where it almost never rained&#x2014;where the sun was a hammer pounding down on a bleached white anvil of sand and rock and hard-baked clay, where the walls of the buildings were thick and white to ward off the blows of the sun, and where graceful women went to the wells in the silvery light of early morning with large clay vessels balanced on their shoulders and black veils across their faces.<br><br>The big roan horse shuddered absently, shaking the rain out of his shaggy coat, and approached the city gate, stopping in the ruddy circle of torchlight before the gatehouse.<br><br>An unshaven gate guard in a rust-splotched breastplate and helmet, and with a patched green cloak negligently hanging from one shoulder, came unsteadily out of the gatehouse and stood swaying in Sparhawk&#x2019;s path. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll need your name,&#x201d; he said in a voice thick with drink.<br><br>Sparhawk gave him a long stare, then opened his cloak to show the heavy silver amulet hanging on a chain about his neck.<br><br>The half-drunk gate guard&#x2019;s eyes widened slightly, and he stepped back a pace. &#x201c;Oh,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;sorry, my Lord. Go ahead.&#x201d;<br><br>Another guard poked his head out of the gatehouse. &#x201c;Who is he, Raf?&#x201d; he demanded.<br><br>&#x201c;A Pandion Knight,&#x201d; the first guard replied nervously.<br><br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s his business in Cimmura?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t question the Pandions, Bral,&#x201d; the man named Raf answered. He smiled ingratiatingly up at Sparhawk. &#x201c;New man,&#x201d; he said apologetically, jerking his thumb back over his shoulder at his comrade. &#x201c;He&#x2019;ll learn in time, my Lord. Can we serve you in any way?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Sparhawk replied, &#x201c;thanks all the same. You&#x2019;d better get in out of the rain, neighbor. You&#x2019;ll catch cold out here.&#x201d; He handed a small coin to the green-cloaked guard and rode on into the city, passing up the narrow, cobbled street beyond the gate with the slow clatter of the big roan&#x2019;s steel-shod hooves echoing back from the buildings.<br><br>The district near the gate was poor, with shabby, run-down houses standing tightly packed beside each other with their second floors projecting out over the wet, littered street. Crude signs swung creaking on rusty hooks in the night wind, identifying this or that tightly shuttered shop on the street-level floors. A wet, miserable-looking cur slunk across the street with his ratlike tail between his legs. Otherwise, the street was dark and empty.<br><br>A torch burned fitfully at an intersection where another street crossed the one upon which Sparhawk rode. A sick young whore, thin and wrapped in a shabby blue cloak, stood hopefully under the torch like a pale, frightened ghost. &#x201c;Would you like a nice time, sir?&#x201d; she whined at him. Her eyes were wide and timid, and her face gaunt and hungry.<br><br>He stopped, bent in his saddle, and poured a few small coins into her grimy hand. &#x201c;Go home, little sister,&#x201d; he told her in a gentle voice. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s late and wet, and there&#x2019;ll be no customers tonight.&#x201d; Then he straightened and rode on, leaving her to stare in grateful astonishment after him. He turned down a narrow side street clotted with shadow and heard the scurry of feet somewhere in the rainy dark ahead of him. His ears caught a quick, whispered conversation in the deep shadows somewhere to his left.<br><br>The roan snorted and laid his ears back.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s nothing to get excited about,&#x201d; Sparhawk told him. The big man&#x2019;s voice was very soft, almost a husky whisper. It was the kind of voice people turned to hear. Then he spoke more loudly, addressing the pair of footpads lurking in the shadows. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d like to accommodate you, neighbors,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;but it&#x2019;s late, and I&#x2019;m not in the mood for casual entertainment. Why don&#x2019;t you go rob some drunk young nobleman instead, and live to steal another day?&#x201d; To emphasize his words, he threw back his damp cloak to reveal the leather-bound hilt of the plain broadsword belted at his side.<br><br>There was a quick, startled silence in the dark street, followed by the rapid patter of fleeing feet.<br><br>The big roan snorted derisively.<br><br>&#x201c;My sentiments exactly,&#x201d; Sparhawk agreed, pulling his cloak back around him. &#x201c;Shall we proceed?&#x201d;<br><br>They entered a large square surrounded by hissing torches where most of the brightly colored canvas booths had their fronts rolled down. A few forlornly hopeful enthusiasts remained open for business, stridently bawling their wares to indifferent passersby hurrying home on a late, rainy evening. Sparhawk reined in his horse as a group of rowdy young nobles lurched unsteadily from the door of a seedy tavern, shouting drunkenly to each other as they crossed the square. He waited calmly until they vanished into a side street and then looked around, not so much wary as alert.<br><br>Had there been but a few more people in the nearly empty square, even Sparhawk&#x2019;s trained eye might not have noticed Krager. The man was of medium height and he was rumpled and unkempt. His boots were muddy, and his maroon cape carelessly caught at the throat. He slouched across the square, his wet, colorless hair plastered down on his narrow skull and his watery eyes blinking nearsightedly as he peered about in the rain. Sparhawk drew in his breath sharply. He hadn&#x2019;t seen Krager since that night in Cippria, almost ten years ago, and the man had aged considerably. His face was grayer and more pouchy-looking, but there could be no question that it was Krager.<br><br>Since quick movements attracted the eye, Sparhawk&#x2019;s reaction was studied. He dismounted slowly and led his big horse to a green canvas food vendor&#x2019;s stall, keeping the animal between himself and the nearsighted man in the maroon cape. &#x201c;Good evening, neighbor,&#x201d; he said to the brown-clad food vendor in his deadly quiet voice. &#x201c;I have some business to attend to. I&#x2019;ll pay you if you&#x2019;ll watch my horse.&#x201d;<br><br>The unshaven vendor&#x2019;s eyes came quickly alight.<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t even think it,&#x201d; Sparhawk warned. &#x201c;The horse won&#x2019;t follow you, no matter what you do&#x2014;but I will, and you wouldn&#x2019;t like that at all. Just take the pay and forget about trying to steal the horse.&#x201d;<br><br>The vendor looked at the big man&#x2019;s bleak face, swallowed hard, and made a jerky attempt at a bow. &#x201c;Whatever you say, my Lord,&#x201d; he agreed quickly, his words tumbling over each other. &#x201c;I vow to you that your noble mount will be safe with me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Noble what?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Noble mount&#x2014;your horse.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, I see. I&#x2019;d appreciate that.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Can I do anything else for you, my Lord?&#x201d;<br><br>Sparhawk looked across the square at Krager&#x2019;s back. &#x201c;Do you by chance happen to have a bit of wire handy&#x2014;about so long?&#x201d; He measured out perhaps three feet with his hands.<br><br>&#x201c;I may have, my Lord. The herring kegs are bound with wire. Let me look.&#x201d;<br><br>Sparhawk crossed his arms and leaned them on his saddle, watching Krager across the horse&#x2019;s back. The past years, the blasting sun, and the women going to the wells in the steely light of early morning fell away, and quite suddenly he was back in the stockyards outside Cippria with the stink of dung and blood on him, the taste of fear and hatred in his mouth, and the pain of his wounds making him weak as his pursuers searched for him with their swords in their hands.<br><br>He pulled his mind away from that, deliberately concentrating on this moment rather than the past. He hoped that the vendor could find some wire. Wire was good. No noise, no mess, and with a little time it could be made to look exotic&#x2014;the kind of thing one might expect from a Styric or perhaps a Pelosian. It wasn&#x2019;t so much Krager, he thought as the tense excitement built in him. Krager had never been more than a dim, feeble adjunct to Martel&#x2014;an extension, another set of hands, just as the other man, Adus, had never been more than a weapon. It was what Krager&#x2019;s death would do to Martel&#x2014;that was what mattered.<br><br>&#x201c;This is the best I could find, my Lord,&#x201d; the greasy-aproned food vendor said respectfully, coming out of the back of his canvas booth and holding out a length of rusty, soft-iron wire. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry. It isn&#x2019;t much.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s just fine,&#x201d; Sparhawk replied, taking the wire. He snapped the rusty strand taut between his hands. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s perfect, in fact.&#x201d; Then he turned to his horse. &#x201c;Stay here, Faran,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>The horse bared his teeth at him. Sparhawk laughed softly and moved out into the square, some distance behind Krager. If the nearsighted man were found in some shadowy doorway, bowed tautly backward with the wire knotted about his neck and ankles and with his eyes popping out of a blackened face, or facedown in the trough of some back-alley public urinal, that would unnerve Martel, hurt him, perhaps even frighten him. It might be enough to bring him out into the open, and Sparhawk had been waiting for years for a chance to catch Martel out in the open. Carefully, his hands concealed beneath his cloak, he began to work the kinks out of his length of wire, even as he stalked his quarry.<br><br>His senses had become preternaturally alert. He could clearly hear the guttering of the torches along the sides of the square and see their orange flicker reflected in the puddles of water lying among the cobblestones. That reflected glow seemed for some reason very beautiful. Sparhawk felt good&#x2014;better perhaps than he had for ten years.<br><br>&#x201c;Sir Knight? Sir Sparhawk? Can that be you?&#x201d;<br><br>Startled, Sparhawk turned quickly, swearing under his breath. The man who had accosted him had long, elegantly curled blond hair. He wore a saffron-colored doublet, lavender hose, and an apple-green cloak. His wet maroon shoes were long and pointed, and his cheeks were rouged. The small, useless sword at his side and his broadbrimmed hat with its dripping plume marked him as a courtier, one of the petty functionaries and parasitic hangers-on who infested the palace like vermin.<br><br>&#x201c;What are you doing back here in Cimmura?&#x201d; the fop demanded, his high-pitched, effeminate voice startled. &#x201c;You were banished.&#x201d;<br><br>Sparhawk looked quickly at the man he had been following. Krager was nearing the entrance to a street that opened into the square, and in a moment he would be out of sight. It was still possible, however. One quick, hard blow would put this overdressed butterfly before him to sleep, and Krager would still be within reach. Then a hot disappointment filled Sparhawk&#x2019;s mouth as a detachment of the watch marched into the square with lumbering tread. There was no way now to dispose of this interfering popinjay without attracting their attention. The look he directed at the perfumed man barring his path was flat with anger.<br><br>The courtier stepped back nervously, glancing quickly at the soldiers who were moving along in front of the booths, checking the fastenings on the rolled-down canvas fronts. &#x201c;I insist that you tell me what you&#x2019;re doing back here,&#x201d; he said, trying to sound authoritative.<br><br>&#x201c;Insist? You?&#x201d; Sparhawk&#x2019;s voice was full of contempt.<br><br>The other man looked quickly at the soldiers again, seeking reassurance, then he straightened boldly. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m taking you in charge, Sparhawk. I demand that you give an account of yourself.&#x201d; He reached out and grasped Sparhawk&#x2019;s arm.<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t touch me.&#x201d; Sparhawk spat out the words, striking the hand away.<br><br>&#x201c;You hit me!&#x201d; the courtier gasped, clutching at his hand in pain.<br><br>Sparhawk took the man&#x2019;s shoulder in one hand and pulled him close. &#x201c;If you ever put your hands on me again, I&#x2019;ll rip out your guts. Now get out of my way.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll call the watch,&#x201d; the fop threatened.<br><br>&#x201c;And how long do you think you&#x2019;ll continue to live after you do that?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You can&#x2019;t threaten me. I have powerful friends.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But they&#x2019;re not here, are they? I am, however.&#x201d; Sparhawk pushed him away in disgust and turned to walk on across the square.<br><br>&#x201c;You Pandions can&#x2019;t get away with this highhanded behavior anymore. There are laws in Elenia now,&#x201d; the overdressed man called after him shrilly. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going straight to Baron Harparin. I&#x2019;m going to tell him that you&#x2019;ve come back to Cimmura and about how you hit me and threatened me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Good,&#x201d; Sparhawk replied without turning. &#x201c;Do that.&#x201d; He continued to walk away, his irritation and disappointment rising to the point where he had to clench his teeth tightly to keep himself under control. Then an idea came to him. It was petty&#x2014;even childish&#x2014;but for some reason it seemed quite appropriate. He stopped and straightened his shoulders, muttering under his breath in the Styric tongue, even as his fingers wove intricate designs in the air in front of him. He hesitated slightly, groping for the word for carbuncle. He finally settled for boils instead and completed the incantation. He turned slightly, looked at his tormentor, and released the spell. Then he turned back and continued on across the square, smiling slightly to himself. It was, to be sure, quite petty, but Sparhawk was like that sometimes.<br><br>He handed the food vendor a coin for minding Faran, swung up into his saddle, and rode across the square in the misty drizzle, a big man shrouded in a rough wool cloak, astride an ugly-faced roan horse.<br><br>Once he was past the square, the streets were dark and empty again, with guttering torches hissing in the rain at intersections and casting their dim, sooty orange glow. The sound of Faran&#x2019;s hooves was loud in the empty street. Sparhawk shifted slightly in his saddle. The sensation he felt was very faint, a kind of prickling of the skin across his shoulders and up the back of his neck, but he recognized it immediately. Someone was watching him, and the watcher was not friendly. Sparhawk shifted again, carefully trying to make the movement appear to be no more than the uncomfortable fidgeting of a saddle-weary traveller. His right hand, however, was concealed beneath his cloak and it sought the hilt of his sword. The oppressive sense of malevolence increased, and then, in the shadows beyond the flickering torch at the next intersection, he saw a figure robed and hooded in a dark gray garment that blended so well into the shadows and wreathing drizzle that the watcher was almost invisible.<br><br>The roan tensed his muscles, and his ears flicked.<br><br>&#x201c;I see him, Faran,&#x201d; Sparhawk replied very quietly.<br><br>They continued on along the cobblestone street, passing through the pool of orange torchlight and on into the shadowy street beyond. Sparhawk&#x2019;s eyes re- adjusted to the dark, but the hooded figure had already vanished up some alleyway or through one of the narrow doors along the street. The sense of being watched was gone, and the street was no longer a place of danger. Faran moved on, his hooves clattering on the wet stones.<br><br>The inn which was Sparhawk&#x2019;s destination was on an unobtrusive back street. It was gated at the front ...</p><h2>Castle: Revised and in Full Color</h2><p>The word itself conjures up mystery, romance, intrigue, and grandeur.

Ferguson</strong></p> <p>The Christian life is a battle. We are in a daily struggle against the world, sin, and Satan.</p> <p>But God didn't leave us to fend for ourselves. He gave us his own armor--armor that Jesus has already worn on our behalf all the way to the cross. The same power that raised Christ from the dead is now at work inside of us. This book unpacks each of the pieces of spiritual armor Paul describes in Ephesians 6, inviting us to take up the armor each day, all while resting in the finished victory of Christ and the assurance that our strength for the battle comes from him.</p></p><p><p><strong>Iain M. Duguid</strong> (PhD, University of Cambridge) is professor of Old Testament and dean of online learning at Westminster Theological Seminary and the pastor of Christ Presbyterian Church in Glenside, Pennsylvania. He has also served as a missionary in Liberia, taught at Westminster Seminary California and Grove City College, and planted churches in Pennsylvania, California, and England.</p><p>&#x201c;This is another great book of expositions by Iain Duguid. In this unfolding of the armor of God, he shows us not only his well-known exegetical skills and accessible writing style but also his pastoral wisdom. This comes from both years in ministry and acquaintance with spiritual classics.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Timothy Keller</strong><strong>,</strong>&nbsp;Founding Pastor, Redeemer Presbyterian Church, New York City; Chairman and Cofounder, Redeemer City to City</p><p>&#x201c;Here is a rare find! This is the work of an Old Testament scholar with an easy-to-read and engaging style who believes in the ongoing activity of the evil one and writes about spiritual warfare with pastoral wisdom and biblical sanity. He knows that the battle in which we engage and the armor God supplies for us are not ideas dreamed up by the apostle Paul but were deeply embedded in the long narrative of the Old Testament. And he knows that the Lord Jesus himself faced the enemy and field-tested the armor for us. So here is a much-needed book, a battle manual for every Christian to use, and a guide for every pastor to follow.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Sinclair B. Ferguson</strong><strong>,</strong> Chancellor&#x2019;s Professor of Systematic Theology, Reformed Theological Seminary; Teaching Fellow, Ligonier Ministries</p><p>&#x201c;A typical nightmare for a soldier is being unarmed and undressed on the battlefield. Drawing upon decades of academic and pastoral ministry, Iain Duguid explains why Christ himself is our armor and how, paradoxically, we can only win the battle through the victory he&#x2019;s already achieved. Along the way, he also opens up wide vistas on how we are to live as battling victors. Highly recommended for personal, family, or group Bible study.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Michael Horton</strong><strong>,</strong> J. Gresham Machen Professor of Systematic Theology and Apologetics, Westminster Seminary California; author, <em>Justification</em> (New Studies in Dogmatics)</p><p>&#x201c;It is a joy to fervently commend this faithful and accessible treatment of Ephesians 6:10&#x2013;20 by Iain Duguid. It is a powerful, gospel-saturated, Christ-exalting, and disciple-making volume that passionately calls us onward as Christian soldiers, fully dressed in the Christ-secured, Bible-defined, and Holy Spirit-delivered &#x2018;whole armor of God.&#x2019;&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Harry L. Reeder III</strong><strong>,</strong> Senior Pastor, Briarwood Presbyterian Church, Birmingham, Alabama; author, <em>From Embers to a Flame</em>; <em>The Leadership Dynamic</em>; and <em>3D Leadership</em></p><p>&#x201c;I like Iain Duguid&#x2019;s exposition for what he avoids. He doesn&#x2019;t drive me to futility, nor does he allow me a cop-out. Duguid sees the gospel lurking in everything Scripture demands of us. In each of these expositions, he places us in the hands of our Redeemer.

In this extraordinary book, James Goll draws from the stories of Elijah, who travailed for rain, and Anna, the praying prophetess whose intercession prepared the way for the Messiah, to illustrate the biblical mandate for intercessory prayer. James tells his own gripping, life-changing experience of how God gave him and his wife four children after years of barrenness, and he uses this testimony as a metaphor for what God can do for dying churches and hopeless circumstances when Christians lay claim to God&#39;s promises. Readers will gain a fresh vision after reading The Prophetic Intercessor for the importance of intercessory prayer for themselves, their churches, and the world.</p><p><b>God's Soldiers Are Strongest When They're on Their Knees<br><br></b>A look at God's greatest warriors shows that the secret to moving heaven and earth lies in kneeling--humbling ourselves before God in prayer and reminding Him of His promises to His people.

It is an epidemic issue where resources are scarce. There isn&#x2019;t a weekend that goes by where we aren&#x2019;t told a gut-wrenching tale of innocence stolen and left trying to help a man or woman make sense of their pain. I praise God for the gospel that can heal and restore and for the Holcombs that had the courage and wisdom to write this book for us.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Matt Chandler</strong><strong>,</strong>&nbsp;Lead Pastor, The Village Church, Dallas, Texas; President, Acts 29 Church Planting Network; author, <em>The Mingling of Souls</em> and <em>The Explicit Gospel&nbsp;</em></p><p>&#x201c;God sees, knows, heals, restores, and redeems. This is the message of hope this book offers, to all who have suffered from abuse. How desperately needed this message is in our culture today! In my interaction with teens and young adults, I have heard many stories of sexual abuse. I am so thrilled that there is a resource like this book that offers relevant, practical, biblical hope and healing words of life.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Rebecca St. James</strong><strong>, </strong>singer; author; actress</p><p>&#x201c;Justin and Lindsey demonstrate a unique level of compassion and concern for victims of sexual assault and the hope for them for healing. The gentle and empathetic tone, along with a sincere belief that victims can experience healing, makes this book indispensable for both victims and those who care for them.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Craig Groeschel</strong><strong>,</strong> Pastor, Life.Church; author, <em>Daily Power: 365 Days of Fuel for Your Soul</em></p><p>&#x201c;The world&#x2015;and too often the church&#x2015;encourages victims of sexual assault to do more. Self-help advice just adds more layers of guilt and a sense of powerlessness. The authors of this excellent book have good news: literally, a gospel that answers our disgrace with the grace of God in Christ. For anyone who suffers from abuse&#x2015;as well as those who minister to them&#x2015;<em>Rid of My Disgrace</em> is powerful, healing medicine.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Michael Horton</strong><strong>,</strong> J. Gresham Machen Professor of Systematic Theology and Apologetics, Westminster Seminary California; Host, <em>White Horse Inn</em>; author, <em>Core Christianity</em></p><p>&#x201c;Where will you find a &#x2018;Theology of the Victim&#x2019; from a Reformed theologian? You just found it. If you&#x2019;ve been the victim of abuse, you won&#x2019;t find yourself blamed in this book. You&#x2019;ll find yourself embraced by the love of a God who meets you in your pain. This will be required reading for all of my students.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Chuck DeGroat</strong><strong>, </strong>Academic Dean, Newbigin House of Studies; Director, City Church Counseling Center</p><p>&#x201c;Some books are easy to read, but this isn&#x2019;t one of them. Its difficulty, however, is not a matter of style or prose but of substance. We don&#x2019;t like thinking about sexual assault and abuse. We&#x2019;d rather pretend they don&#x2019;t exist. But the church can no longer afford to turn a blind eye to the extent of this problem or to ignore the devastation it brings to both body and soul. What makes this book so worthy of your attention, notwithstanding the discomfort it may cause you to feel, is the wealth of wisdom, gospel grace, and pastoral sensitivity that the Holcombs bring to bear on those affected by this experience. No matter how deep the pain or sense of loss endured by the victims of sexual assault, God&#x2019;s healing grace and power are greater still. Highly recommended!&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Sam Storms</strong><strong>,</strong>&nbsp;Senior Pastor, Bridgeway Church, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma</p><p>&#x201c;One can tell that the Holcombs have extensive experience working with victims of various kinds of assault because this book is so comprehensive in elucidating the types of healing necessary. Thoroughly researched, richly evangelical in theology, strongly assertive to deliver from blame and guilt, <em>Rid of My Disgrace</em> is heartily recommended for all who suffer from sexual exploitation.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Marva J. Dawn</strong><strong>, </strong>theologian; speaker; author, <em>Being Well When We're Ill</em>; <em>In the Beginning GOD</em>; and <em>Talking the Walk</em></p><p>&#x201c;As the President of Youth for Christ/USA, I am a first hand witness to thousands of lives that have been impacted and marred by sexual assault. Often the trauma is replaced by debilitating shame and despair. I was moved and inspired by the thoughtful, comprehensive and approachable way that Justin and Lindsey Holcomb unpack the power of grace. The pages of the book unwrap the gift of God, they unlock the shackles of guilt, and they unleash the Spirit of God to transform. <em>Rid of My Disgrace</em> is an important work, for a vital time, to a broken people. I praise God for the fruit that this book will produce.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Dan Wolgemuth</strong><strong>,</strong> President/CEO, Youth for Christ</p><p>&#x201c;Written passionately from the agony that haunts victims, this book also offers a message of hope and healing. It is an invaluable resource for those who have been victimized and a must-read for family, friends, pastors, or counselors of victims to be equipped to serve and love them well.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Jud Wilhite</strong>, author, <em>Eyes Wide Open</em>&nbsp;and <em>Uncensored Grace</em>; Senior Pastor, Central Christian Church, Las Vegas, Nevada</p><p>&#x201c;This important book places the powder keg of gospel truth where it is most needed: on the frontline of pastoral ministry. A mixture of clear writing, real-life stories, and faithful Bible exposition makes this a powerful resource in the fight for redemption in the lives of those we are called to serve.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Joel Virgo</strong>, Lead Pastor, Church of Christ the King, Brighton</p><p>&#x201c;This is a sad and disturbing book. The &#x2018;dark&#x2019; of it will keep you awake at night. But the &#x2018;light&#x2019; will cause you to sing with joy and hope. What a gift to the church and to those who have felt the shame of sexual assault or who love those who have! Read it and give it to your friends. They will rise up and call you blessed! It is the best book I&#x2019;ve ever read on the subject of abuse...and I&#x2019;ve read a lot of them.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Steve Brown</strong><strong>,</strong>&nbsp;Host, <em>Key Life</em> Radio Program; author, <em>Three Free Sins: God Isn't Mad At You&nbsp;</em></p><p>&#x201c;This compelling, disturbing and hopeful book written from the perspective of the Christian faith, has the potential to be a lifeline for many who have experienced the horror of sexual violence.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Rob Morris</strong><strong>, </strong>President and cofounder, Love146</p><p>&#x201c;<em>Rid of My Disgrace</em> reminds victims of sexual assault that they are not alone and it is not the end of the story. From King David&#x2019;s daughter Tamar to the courageous survivors telling their stories today, the Holcombs take sexual assault out of the shadows of shame and isolation and into the light of the gospel. With a solid grasp on both the effects of sexual assault and of redemptive history, the Holcombs thoroughly identify sexual assault and its aftermath while calling the reader to let even such a painful, hideous act be a part of their story of redemption through Christ&#x2019;s sufficient work on the cross.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Monica Taffinder</strong><strong>, </strong>cofounder and counselor, Grace Clinic Christian Counseling</p><p>&#x201c;This book helped us understand the painful emotions that go along with the particular suffering of sexual assault. But more than that, it showed us how to respond to our twelve-year-old son who was assaulted.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Parents of a child victim</strong></p><p>&#x201c;I thought I had gotten over the abuses in my past&#x2015;I had forgiven my abusers, stopped feeling like a victim, and felt like I was a stronger person. After reading <em>Rid of My Disgrace</em>, I realized there were still underlying issues I hadn&#x2019;t dealt with that were preventing me from getting close to other people and, worst of all, preventing me from having a deeper relationship with God. Each chapter not only discussed each emotion that had been secretly weighing on me, but also showed me that those emotions don&#x2019;t have to rule me. Jesus&#x2019; death and resurrection apply not only to my sins, but also to the burden of someone else&#x2019;s sin against me. My identity is no longer as &#x2018;damaged goods.&#x2019; It is &#x2018;child of God&#x2019; and with that comes God&#x2019;s unending love. I highly recommend this book for anyone who has experienced not only some form of sexual abuse, but other abuses as well.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Adult female victim</strong></p></p><h2>Food52 Any Night Grilling: 60 Ways to Fire Up Dinner (and More) [A Cookbook] (Food52 Works)</h2><p><b>This innovative collection of recipes will have you grilling deeply flavorful dishes for lunch, dinner, or any time.</b><br><br>In Food52&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>Any Night Grilling</i>, author (and Texan) Paula Disbrowe coaches you through the fundamentals of cooking over fire so the simple pleasure of a freshly grilled meal can be enjoyed any night of the week&#x2014;no long marinades or low-and-slow cook times here.

The high heat renders the fat, crisping the skin and making them taste both rich and improbably light (unlike the gut-bomb sports bar variety). Of course, wings are the quintessential party snack, something spicy and messy to entertain you while you&#x2019;re sipping cocktails and swapping one-liners. They can also be the attraction, join other small plates, or provide a hearty snack for friends waiting on something with a longer cooking time, like a smoked whole turkey or brisket. A two-zone fire is essential here because it provides nice heat for an initial char, as well as a moderate zone to cook the meat through without scorching the skin. I use drumettes because they&#x2019;re meaty and easier to eat, and Cholula for the hot sauce. It&#x2019;s a smoky Mexican hot sauce that&#x2019;s delicious on eggs, tacos, and just about everything.<br><br> 3 pounds (1.4kg) chicken wing drumettes<br> Olive oil, for drizzling<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 1&#x2044;4 cup (60ml) Cholula hot sauce<br> 3 tablespoons freshly chopped parsley<br> 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature<br> 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice<br> 2 cloves garlic, minced&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> 1. Place the drumettes in a large bowl, drizzle with enough olive oil to lightly coat, generously season with salt and pepper, and toss to combine.<br> &nbsp;<br> 2. Prepare a charcoal grill for two-zone cooking and build a medium-high fire, or heat a gas grill to high. Carefully wipe the preheated grill grates with a lightly oiled paper towel. Using a grill brush, scrape the grill grates clean, then carefully wipe with a lightly oiled towel again.<br> &nbsp;<br> 3. While the grill heats, in a separate bowl, stir together the Cholula, parsley, butter, lemon juice, and garlic.<br> &nbsp;<br> 4. Grill the drumettes over direct heat, flipping and rotating as needed for even cooking, until nicely charred on all sides, 5 to 7 minutes. Move the drumettes to indirect heat, close the grill, and continue to cook, turning the drumettes often (and closing the grill lid in between), until cooked through and the juices run clear (if you&#x2019;re uncertain, cut into one to check), 20 to 25 minutes.<br> &nbsp;<br> 5. Place the hot drumettes in the bowl with the Cholula butter, toss vigorously until well coated, and serve immediately.</p><h2>Brodo: A Bone Broth Cookbook</h2><p>No one has been more responsible for the recent explosion of interest in bone than New York City chef Marco Canora.&nbsp; After completely revitalizing his health by integrating bone broth into his diet, Marco began to make his nourishing broths available by the cupful to New Yorkers from a small window in his East Village restaurant, drawing sell-out crowds virtually from the beginning.

His rags to riches story has never been told as dramatically and vividly as in Nasaw's new biography. Carnegie, the son of an impoverished linen weaver, moved to Pittsburgh at the age of thirteen. The embodiment of the American dream, he pulled himself up from bobbin boy in a cotton factory to become the richest man in the world. He spent the rest of his life giving away the fortune he had accumulated and crusading for international peace. For all that he accomplished and came to represent to the American public&#x2014;a wildly successful businessman and capitalist, a self-educated writer, peace activist, philanthropist, man of letters, lover of culture, and unabashed enthusiast for American democracy and capitalism&#x2014;Carnegie has remained, to this day, an enigma. <br><br>Nasaw explains how Carnegie made his early fortune and what prompted him to give it all away, how he was drawn into the campaign first against American involvement in the Spanish-American War and then for international peace, and how he used his friendships with presidents and prime ministers to try to pull the world back from the brink of disaster. With a trove of new material&#x2014;unpublished chapters of Carnegie's Autobiography; personal letters between Carnegie and his future wife, Louise, and other family members; his prenuptial agreement; diaries of family and close friends; his applications for citizenship; his extensive correspondence with Henry Clay Frick; and dozens of private letters to and from presidents Grant, Cleveland, McKinley, Roosevelt, and British prime ministers Gladstone and Balfour, as well as friends Herbert Spencer, Matthew Arnold, and Mark Twain&#x2014;Nasaw brilliantly plumbs the core of this facinating and complex man, deftly placing his life in cultural and political context as only a master storyteller can.</p><p><b>David Nasaw</b>&nbsp;is the author of&nbsp;<i>Andrew Carnegie</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>The Chief: The Life of William Randolph Hearst</i>. He is the Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr., Professor of History at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York.Andrew Carnegie was almost the exact contemporary of Charles Sherwood Stratton, better known as Tom Thumb, and easily could have been mistaken for P.T. Barnum's celebrated performing midget. At his tallest, Carnegie never got above five feet, he weighed barely over 100 pounds, and, David Nasaw reports, he "wore high-heeled boots and a top hat to disguise his lack of size." But resemblances ended right there. Any way you measured him, Carnegie was a giant. He established and subsequently dominated the steel industry, he invested early and wisely in oil, he multiplied his millions many times over -- and then he gave away "more than $350 million (in the tens of billions today)" to charities and worthy causes so numerous as to defy cataloguing. <p>Here in Washington, as almost everywhere else in America, his mark is inescapable. The Carnegie Library at Mount Vernon Place, a model of the Beaux Arts style, was donated to the city by him in 1902, along with three branch libraries. The neoclassical building of the Carnegie Institution, on P Street, is one of the city's architectural glories and the headquarters of one of the world's most important centers of scientific research. On Massachusetts Ave., the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace continues its valiant, hopeless struggle against humankind's baser inclinations, and on New York Avenue the Washington office of Carnegie Mellon University conducts many activities of local, national and international importance. </p><p>Carnegie's story is right out of Horatio Alger, though he makes Ragged Dick look like a mere piker. The poor Scot arrives in Pittsburgh in 1848, age 12, child of an aimless father and industrious mother. Goes to work at an early age and quickly ingratiates himself to all with "his remarkably sunny disposition, his broad smile, and non-stop, good natured chatter" -- not to mention his capacity for hard work and his nimble mind. Soon he is a messenger boy for the telegraph office -- "the perfect position for an ambitious, affable young man" -- and soon after that becomes a telegraph operator, "the most sought-after operator in the company" because he is the smartest and the quickest. On he moves to the Pennsylvania Railroad, not yet 20 years old, and wins the favor of its president-to-be. He's offered the opportunity to buy shares in another company, and eagerly does so, with a loan from the boss, and later gets his first dividend check. </p><p> "I shall remember that check as long as I live," he wrote many years later. "It gave me the first penny of revenue from capital -- something I had not worked for with the sweat of my brow. 'Eureka!' I cried. 'Here's the goose that lays the golden eggs.' " With that he was off. During the Civil War he helped keep the trains running -- he paid $850 to an Irish immigrant to take his place in the army -- and began to make farsighted but prudent investments. "Meteoric" scarcely begins to describe his upward trajectory: </p><p>"Almost thirty, Andrew Carnegie was the principal shareholder in several thriving companies, a partner in several more, and a force in local business circles, well known and respected for his acumen and his access to capital. He paid taxes on an income of $17,500 in 1864, with an additional $1 tax for his one-horse carriage. A year later, his income had risen to $38,735 ($5.6 million today), on which he paid a tax of $3,655. Again, he was charged an additional $1 tax for his carriage, $2 for his gold watch, and $4 for his pianoforte." </p><p>It is an astonishing story and even now, almost nine decades after his death, one that is familiar to many Americans. Carnegie, after all, is the giant of the Gilded Age, his only real rival being his contemporary and friendly acquaintance John D. Rockefeller. Never has this story been told so thoroughly or so well as David Nasaw tells it in this massive and monumental biography. Nasaw, who teaches history at the City University of New York and is the author of an excellent biography of William Randolph Hearst, has gotten access to a great deal of material unavailable to previous biographers and has made the most -- at times too much -- of it. Andrew Carnegie would be a better book had it been pared down from 800 pages of text to, say, 650, because Nasaw is in love with his research and cannot let go of it even when it becomes redundant, but only readers laboring under constraints of time are likely to complain; this is biography on the grand scale, and on the whole it lives up to its author's ambitions. </p><p>Not the least of its qualities is that Nasaw, unlike most biographers of prominent public figures, does not scant the private side of his subject's life. He trowels on all the details about how Carnegie became richer and richer and richer -- he was both the beneficiary and the victim of what Nasaw wryly calls "the inexorable logic of compound interest" -- and how in March 1901 he sold out to J.P. Morgan for the then-unimaginable sum of $400 million, making possible the formation of U.S. Steel, but he is no less attentive to Carnegie's intimate and inner sides. He admires his subject -- "one of the most fascinating men I have encountered, a man who was many things in his long life, but never boring" -- but sees him with eyes wide open, and thus paints a portrait that is balanced, nuanced and, in the end, fair and probably accurate. </p><p>Nasaw doesn't dwell overlong on Carnegie's physical stature, but probably that is where one must start. Samuel Clemens, who was one of his many famous friends, wrote that "Mr. Carnegie is no smaller than Napoleon, . . . but for some reason or other he looks smaller than he really is. He looks incredibly small, almost unthinkably small." To the end of his life Carnegie was "the undersized outsider with the funny accent who had been uprooted from his home" in Scotland and never forgot it. His "insecurities were legion," but he "battled his demons and insecurities in silence. He was a master at compartmentalizing his life, building barriers between Carnegie the lovesick suitor, Carnegie the powerful industrialist, and Carnegie the man of letters, disciple of Herbert Spencer, and confidant of Matthew Arnold." </p><p>Apart from his mother and wife, Herbert Spencer almost certainly was the most important influence in Carnegie's life. The British philosopher is now almost entirely forgotten outside academic circles, but in the second half of the 19th century he was one of the most influential and widely read writers in the West. He and Carnegie became friends of sorts -- Spencer seems to have been singularly disagreeable and antisocial -- but that meant less than the philosophical underpinnings Spencer provided for Carnegie. He was a gloomy man but a sunny moralizer: "Spencer offered Carnegie and his generation an intellectual foundation for their optimism, their sense that history was a record of forward progress, by arguing that material progress went hand-in-hand with moral progress, that industrialization was a higher state of civilization than that which preceded it, and that the future would be even rosier than the present." </p><p>Spencer taught Carnegie that "his success as a businessman . . . depended on his adherence to the laws of the marketplace, which, because they were embedded in a larger evolutionary schema, were as moral as they were inexorable. The path of evolutionary progress he was following would be strewn with hardships and sacrifice; but these were unavoidable in the short term if mankind was going to benefit over the long term." Hardships and sacrifice were far more likely to be exacted upon the laboring classes than upon their wealthy employer; this was regrettable but also unavoidable, because it was toward the greater goal of putting sufficient money into the hands of Carnegie and his peers so that they could redistribute it for the benefit of all. </p><p>Carnegie devoutly believed this: that he was part of a chosen elect -- chosen by whom is unclear, since he was not a religious man -- whose responsibility it was to decide how the wealth of society could be best and most wisely allocated. He was not the first or the last to hold such a belief. It is one of the enduring contradictions of American democracy that on the one hand we believe in rule by popular vote, yet on the other we have acquiesced in the formation of a ruling class whose power comes not from the vote but from the pocketbook. Carnegie, who so passionately believed in America and its institutions that he was known as "the Star-Spangled Scotchman," not merely saw no contradiction but believed that it was natural law and that he had been naturally selected. </p><p>Carnegie formulated a "gospel of wealth," relying heavily on Spencer, that rebutted "protests against the unequal distribution of wealth by arguing that the common good was best served by allowing men like himself to accumulate and retain huge fortunes. The more wealth that landed in wise hands, the more that could be given away -- wisely -- by the retired capitalist acting 'as trustee and agent for his poorer brethren, bringing to their service his superior wisdom, experience, and ability to administer, doing for them better than they would or could do for themselves.' " </p><p>He was as good as his word. Whether the decisions he made were wiser than those that would have been made by an elected government is at least debatable, but the hundreds of libraries built by this man who loved to read enriched the nation incalculably, and his other benefactions similarly made the country a better place. He did himself no honor when he remained silent as his company called in "a private army of detectives to battle its own employees" in the bloody, infamous Homestead Strike of 1892, and the incredible luxury in which he lived with his beloved wife and daughter scarcely suggested sacrifice on his own part, yet on the whole he was honorable and public-spirited. Far more wealth came his way than any human deserves, but he did far better by his good fortune than most others similarly blessed. </p><p> </p><p></p><p><br>Copyright 2006, The Washington Post.

Most obsolete interfaces have been removed, except for a few that are ubiquitous. Nearly all examples have been tested on four modern platforms: Solaris 10, Mac OS X version 10.6.8 (Darwin 10.8.0), FreeBSD 8.0, and Ubuntu version 12.04 (based on Linux 3.2).</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>As in previous editions, you&#x2019;ll learn through examples, including more than ten thousand lines of downloadable, ISO C source code. More than four hundred system calls and functions are demonstrated with concise, complete programs that clearly illustrate their usage, arguments, and return values.

Two of five children born to David Rucki and Sandra Grazzini-Rucki, the teenage sisters vanished in the midst of their parents divorce.<br>The girls father, David Rucki, worked tirelessly with law enforcement to search day and night for his two missing daughters, following every lead while raising three remaining children at home. Their mother, Sandra Grazzini-Rucki, used her newfound freedom to vacation around the world, abandoning her children. And as the investigation intensified, catching the attention of the media, Sandra also disappeared. <br><br><i>The Girls Are Gone</i> is the true story of two sisters who went missing, the father who kept searching, and the adults who conspired to keep the truth hidden.</p><p><b>Michael Brodkorb's</b> reporting on the Samantha and Gianna Rucki case began with the Star Tribune in 2015.

Donovan, Senior Reviewer&nbsp;<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</b><b>Midwest Book Review </b>The Girls Are Gone By Michael Brodkorb and Allison Mann is an excellent true crime book. The two authors became acquainted in 2016; Michael a reporter and Allison representing David Rucki in court. This is a very involved book with lots of detail, including court transcripts, telling the whole story from start to finish, filling in some of the lesser known details about the case. This book reads like a crime novel but is far more horrifying, given that we know it is the truth. It is riveting and compelling reading but it will require some staying power. Loved it! I like true crime stories and this one is way above any other just because of the amount of detail and the way it was written; matter of fact yet drawing you into the web a step at a time.

There&#x2019;s no finicky yeast to deal with and thus no rising time, just a brief resting period so the flour can become supple and smooth. If you don&#x2019;t measure your ingredients by weight, it&#x2019;s important to use the spoon-and-sweep method instead of dipping a measuring cup directly into the flour. When you scoop with a measuring cup, the flour is compacted into the cup, adding up to 1 extra ounce of weight (1 &#x2044; 4 cup of volume) to each cupful. That translates to too much flour in the dough and tough, chewy pierogies. So either grab a kitchen scale and make life easier, or lightly fluff the flour with a spoon, then use the spoon to fill the measuring cup, leveling excess flour off with a knife.</p> <p>2 large eggs</p> <p>1 &#x2044; 2 cup (4 ounces, 113 grams) sour cream or plain Greek yogurt (full-fat, reduced-fat, or nonfat)</p> <p>3 tablespoons (1 1 &#x2044; 2 ounces, 43 grams) unsalted butter, melted and slightly cooled</p> <p>For savory pierogies: 1 teaspoon kosher salt </p> <p>For sweet pierogies: 1 tablespoon sugar and 1 &#x2044; 4 teaspoon kosher salt</p> <p>2 cups (8 1 &#x2044; 2 ounces, 240 grams) unbleached all-purpose flour</p> <p>1 tablespoon water</p> <p>Whisk 1 egg, sour cream or yogurt, butter, and salt (for savory pierogies) or sugar and salt (for sweet pierogies) in a bowl. Add flour to a large bowl. Gently stir wet ingredients into flour. Thedough will initially be very dry and shaggy, seeming as if it will never come together, but have no fear: Keep stirring, and it will pull itself into shape.</p> <p>Once the dough starts to come together, press and smash it against the sides of the bowl with your palms, picking up dough bits and essentially kneading it within the bowl until it forms a ball.</p> <p>Tip dough and any remaining shaggy flakes out onto a clean work surface or Roul&#x2019;Pat. Knead until smooth, about 1 minute. Cover dough with the bowl and let rest 15 minutes. Whisk remaining egg and water in a small bowl for egg wash. </p></p><h2>At the Same Moment, Around the World</h2><p>Discover Benedict drinking hot chocolate in Paris, France; Mitko chasing the school bus in Sofia, Bulgaria; and Khanh having a little nap in Hanoi, Vietnam!

By planning your meals, especially in a Freezer Club (see page 25), and cooking in large quantities, you'll see your grocery bill go down significantly. We've found that when we cook this way, a four-serving meal tends to cost around $8 to $12 depending on the ingredients needed. This translates to about $2 to $3 per person for a wholesome, healthy meal. Plus, having ready-to-go meals within reach reduces the temptation to spend cash eating out. Who needs to wait for takeout when you have Turkey Pesto Paninis or Parmesan and Herb Chicken Tenders in the freezer, just a few minutes away from being piping hot? <br><br><b>2. Cuts down on prep and cooking time, leaving you with more freedom to</b> <b>relax and spend time with loved ones.</b> Let's be honest. Cooking a well-rounded, healthy dinner every night is a daunting task for anyone. Deciding what to make, shopping, prepping, cooking, and cleaning up can sap the last bit of physical and mental energy you have after a long day. Add a few tired, grumpy kids to the mix, and the dinner hour can be quite a challenge. By having meals that you doubled from a previous meal or made with a group of friends (see Chapters 2 and 3) ready to go in the freezer, you'll cut down on all those extra little trips to the store during the week. Even more importantly, you'll reduce your prep, cooking, and cleanup time regularly, leaving weeknights freer to relax, spend time with your family, exercise, enjoy hobbies, or whatever else has been crowded out of your life by the daily cooking grind! <br><br><b>3. Provides a wide variety of wholesome, nutrient-dense meals to help you</b> <b>eat more healthfully.</b> Freezer cooking, especially using the recipes in this book, makes homemade food full of real, wholesome ingredients readily available. We believe eating a healthy diet means consuming a variety of whole foods, ones that are closest to their natural state. Through research and our own experience, we've learned that when we consume real food-with an emphasis on lots of produce, whole grains, organic or local meats and dairy, wild- caught seafood, and healthy fats-our bodies tend to do what they are supposed to do. We have more energy, sleep better, avoid headaches and stomachaches, and feel comfortably full and stop from overeating more easily. Whole foods are the fuel our bodies are made to run on. The good news is that freezer cooking can help you eat more whole foods in two main ways. First, cooking from scratch allows you to control what goes into your food, thus avoiding loads of extra sodium, sugar, unhealthy fats, preservatives, additives, and food dyes that are packed into fast food and other processed, store-bought foods. Second, freezer cooking also means you will have nutritious, easy-to-prepare meals at your fingertips all the time, which results in fewer fast-food runs or prepackaged meal purchases. Once you learn how easy it is to stock your freezer, your family will be well on their way to eating a wide range of nutritious foods every day. <br><br><b>4. Allows you to always have meals on hand to take to a friend in need.</b> With freezer cooking, it's easy to have meals ready to go to take to new parents or others in need. Over the years, we have given many new moms, people in crisis, grandparents, college students, and even a man recently released from prison some extra freezer meals to bake or warm up at their convenience. With meals in the freezer, you can be that friend who shows up at someone's doorstep with a healthy dinner and a few words of encouragement. It's a simple act of caring and thoughtfulness that can make a bigger impact than you may realize. If you choose to freezer cook with friends, there are even more advantages to reap. <br><br><b>5. Expands your family's palette.</b> It's easy to fall into a rut and make the same meals on a regular rotation, isn't it? A Freezer Cooking Party or Freezer Club allows you to experience different kinds of cuisines, flavors, and ingredients that you may not normally prepare at home. This has been a great palate-expanding experience for our children (and husbands!). Even better, it has also allowed us to get more nutritional variety into our bodies and the bodies of our families. <br><br><b>6. Helps you become a better cook.</b> Among other things, freezer cooking with friends can stretch you as a home cook. It has forced us to try our hand at all kinds of new recipes. As a result, our recipe repertoire and cooking skills have grown beyond anything we could have accomplished on our own. It's almost like taking a cooking class with your friends, but at the end you all leave as savvier, more experienced cooks with stocked freezers! <br><br><b>7. It's fun.</b> Last and certainly not least, we think freezer cooking with our friends is simply fun! At our Freezer Club meetings and Freezer Cooking Parties, we often have coffee, wine, snacks, and a great time hanging out together. To top it all off, you get to come home and fill your freezer to the brim with already-prepared healthy meals. It's the perfect night out, if you ask us!<br><br><b>WHAT ARE THE STEPS TO SUCCESSFULLY FREEZING MEALS?</b><br><br>Freezer cooking isn't especially hard, but there are a few keys to success. To get the tastiest results, keep these six simple steps in mind.<br><br><b>STEP 1</b><br><br> <b>Use high-quality fresh ingredients that stand up well to freezing and</b> <b>thawing.</b><br><br>Rule #1 of freezer cooking is that what you put in is what you get out. Be sure to select only the freshest, high-quality foods to use in your freezer meals. If an ingredient didn't taste good to begin with, it certainly won't be better after freezing. Also keep in mind that some foods freeze and thaw much better than others. While it's safe to freeze most foods, the texture and taste of some are extremely compromised after being frozen and thawed, as the box on page 5 shows. Additionally, seasoning and spices can tend to get stronger when they sit in the freezer in a meal. Season lightly before freezing, and add additional seasonings when reheating or serving.<br><br>FOODS THAT TYPICALLY DON'T FREEZE AND THAW WELL<br><br>Note: Some of these ingredients will freeze well within a recipe. However, the texture may change if frozen as a single ingredient. <br><br>VEGETABLES: celery, cucumbers, lettuce, onions, bell peppers, potatoes, radishes, sprouts <br><br>FRUITS: apples, citrus fruits, grapes, melons <br><br>DAIRY: soft cheeses, cottage cheese, cream cheese, cream, custard, mayonnaise, sour cream, yogurt <br><br>OTHER: canned food still in cans, eggs in shells, fried foods, pasta cooked beyond al dente<br><br><b>STEP 2</b><br><br> <b>Chill cooked dishes before freezing.</b><br><br>It's important to let freshly cooked dishes cool before placing them in the freezer. There are a number of reasons for this. First, putting foods that are still warm in the freezer can raise the freezer's temperature. This can cause surrounding frozen items to partially thaw and refreeze, which can alter the taste and texture of those foods. Second, placing hot food in a plastic freezer bag or container can result in the plastic releasing chemicals into the food. Third, warm food freezes so slowly that ice crystals form on top, which can also alter the texture of the freezer meal. To avoid contamination while allowing food to cool, never let perishable food sit out on the counter for longer than 2 hours. To bring down the temperature more quickly, place partially cooled food in a shallow, wide container and refrigerate it, uncovered, until cold. Or, to chill soup or stew quickly, pour it into a metal bowl and set it in a larger bowl filled halfway with ice water. Stir occasionally.<br><br><b>STEP 3</b><br><br> <b>Freeze in an airtight, freezable container.</b><br><br>There are multiple ways that meals can be stored in the freezer. Your freezing method will likely depend on the space in your freezer, the types of meals you make, and what containers you have on hand. Whatever method you choose, the goal is to prevent the food from being exposed to air, which can result in freezer burn. Freezer burn occurs when the moisture in the outer layers evaporates, leaving behind "dry" pockets. While it isn't harmful to eat freezer-burned food, the texture and flavor can be adversely affected. Wrapping food tightly and using the four freezing methods we recommend on page 8 will help keep freezer burn at bay. It's also helpful to label your meals so you know exactly what they are and how long they have been in the freezer. Affix a label to each container with the name of the dish, number of servings (or volume/weight), and the date you put it in the freezer.<br><br><b>STEP 4</b><br><br> <b>Freeze quickly and at the right temperature.</b><br><br>The faster food freezes, the better its quality will be once it's defrosted. Slowly frozen food forms large ice crystals that may turn the food mushy. Here are some tips for freezing food quickly and at the right temperature: Store all foods at 0�F or lower to retain vitamin content, flavor, texture, and color. Use a freezer thermometer to ensure this. Do not crowd the freezer, so that there is enough room for air to circulate around food, allowing it to freeze rapidly. Never stack packages to be frozen. Instead, spread them out in one layer on various shelves, stacking them only after they're frozen solid. Store soups and stews in freezer bags, which can be placed flat and will freeze quickly. Store foods in small servings, when possible, to help them freeze quickly. This also allows you to defrost only what you need. A secondary freezer is not a necessity for freezer cooking, but it can be helpful if you want to make freezer cooking a lifestyle. It can actually store food at a more constant, lower temperature than a refrigerator's freezer, protecting the taste and texture of food longer. Plus, it provides room for stocking up on ingredients when they are on sale, saving produce when it is in season, and stacking up all of those freezer meals you'll be accumulating soon. A secondary freezer doesn't have to be huge and expensive, though. Simply start with a standard chest freezer. If you want something bigger, both of us have the Frigidaire Gallery 2-in-1 Upright Freezer and love it.<br><br><b>STEP 5</b><br><br> <b>Follow recommended storage times for freezing meals.</b><br><br>From a safety standpoint, food that is properly packaged and safely frozen (kept at a constant temperature of 0�F or lower) can be frozen indefinitely. Yes, indefinitely! However, even though something may be safe to eat, that doesn't mean it will taste its best after a long time in the freezer. The chart on page 10 provides some general guidelines for how long to freeze particular foods and still maintain their quality. These recommendations are conservative and somewhat subjective, to be honest. We have frozen food much longer than some of these times with good results. There are many variables that affect the amount of time food can be frozen (type of freezer, ingredients in the recipe, quality of the packaging, etc.), so it's hard to say exactly when a freezer meal will go "bad." Regardless, it is good to have a rough idea of how long something can hang out in your freezer.</p><h2>Create Perfect Paintings: An Artist&#39;s Guide to Visual Thinking</h2><p><b>The Ultimate Resource and Reference Guide for Artists!</b><br><br> Discover an innovative self-critique method that will empower you to answer the artist's most common questions, <i>Now What?</i> and <i>Is it Finished?</i> as you learn to identify and overcome painting issues faced by artists regardless of medium or style.

In &#34;The Mortification of Sin,&#34; John Owen insisted on the importance of the Christian dealing effectively with their sinful tendencies and attitudes. He believed that God, through his Word and Spirit, had provided the guidelines and the power for this to be achieved. In &#34;The Mortification of Sin,&#34; John Owen effectively dismisses various excuses for not engaging in self-scrutiny and yet avoids the current trend of self-absorption. In so doing he provides principles to help believers live lives of holiness. As with all of Owen&#39;s writings, &#34;The Mortification of Sin&#34; continues to be widely read and greatly appreciated to this day.</p><p>Dr. John Owen (1616-1683), theologian, was born of Puritan parents at Stadham in Oxfordshire in 1616. At twelve years of age he was admitted at Queen&#39;s College, Oxford, where he took his B.A. degree in 1632 and M.A. in 1635. During these years he worked with such diligence that he allowed himself but four hours sleep a night, and damaged his health by this excessive labour. In 1637 he was driven from Oxford by his refusal to comply with the requirements of Laud&#39;s new statutes. Having taken orders shortly before, he became chaplain and tutor in the family of Sir Robert Dormer of Ascot in Oxfordshire. At the outbreak of the civil troubles he adopted Parliamentary principles, and thus lost both his place and the prospects of succeeding to his uncle&#39;s fortune. For a while he lived in Charterhouse Yard, in great unsettlement of mind on religious questions, which was removed at length by a sermon which he accidently heard at St Michael&#39;s in Wood Street.</p><h2>Days of Rage: America&#39;s Radical Underground, the FBI, and the Forgotten Age of Revolutionary Violence</h2><p><p><b>From the bestselling author of&nbsp;<i>Public Enemies</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>The Big Rich</i>, an&nbsp;explosive account of the decade-long battle between the FBI and the&nbsp;homegrown revolutionary movements of the 1970s</b><br> &nbsp;<br> The Weathermen.

IT&#x2019;S NOW. YOU DIG?&#x201d;<br><br>Sam Melville and the Birth of the American Underground<br><br>NEW YORK CITY | AUGUST 1969<br><br>On a drizzly Friday afternoon they drove north out of the city in a battered station wagon, six more shaggy radicals, a baby, and two dogs, heading toward a moment unlike any they had seen.&nbsp;<i>Jimi. Janis. The Who. The Dead.&nbsp;</i>They were like hundreds of thousands of young Americans that season, one part aimless, druggy, and hedonistic, two parts angry, idealistic, and determined to right all the wrongs they saw in 1969 America: racism, repression, police brutality, the war.<br><br> Traffic on the New York State Thruway was slow, but a pipeful of hashish and a few beers left everyone feeling fine. Ten miles from their destination, the car sagged into a traffic jam. One couple got out to walk. The girl, who was twenty-two that day, was Jane Alpert, a petite, bookish honors graduate of Swarthmore College with brunette bangs. She wrote for the&nbsp;<i>Rat Subterranean News</i>, the kind of East Village radical newspaper that published recipes for Molotov cocktails. Later, friends would describe her as &#x201c;sweet&#x201d; and &#x201c;gentle.&#x201d; As she stepped from the car Alpert lifted a copy of&nbsp;<i>Rat&nbsp;</i>to ward off the raindrops.<br><br>Beside her trudged her thirty-five-year-old lover, Sam Melville, a rangy, broad-chested activist who wore his thinning hair dangling around his shoulders. Melville was a troubled soul, a brooder with a dash of charisma, a man determined to make his mark. Only Jane and a handful of their friends knew how he intended to do it. Only they knew about the dynamite in the refrigerator.<br><br> Slogging through the rain, they didn&#x2019;t reach the Woodstock festival until almost midnight. Ducking into a large tent, Jane curled up beside a stranger&#x2019;s air mattress and managed an hour of sleep. She found Melville the next morning wandering through the movement booths, manned by Yippies and Crazies and Black Panthers and many more. After a long day listening to music, she glimpsed him deep in conversation with one of the Crazies, a thirty-something character named George Demmerle, who could usually be found at New York demonstrations in a crash helmet and purple cape. &#x201c;That George,&#x201d; Melville said as they left. &#x201c;He really is crazy. I offered to spell him at the booth, but he said only bona fide Crazies ought to work the official booth.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s because he&#x2019;s old,&#x201d; Jane said. &#x201c;He wants to be a twenty-year-old freak.&#x201d; When Melville dropped his head, Jane realized she had offended him. He and Demmerle were almost the same age.<br><br> The echoes of Jimi Hendrix&#x2019;s last solo could still be heard at Woodstock on Monday morning when Jane left the East Village apartment she shared with Melville and walked to work. They had been squabbling all summer and had decided to see other people. That night, though, she canceled a date and returned to the apartment to find him glumly sitting on the bed. &#x201c;I thought you had a date,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>&#x201c;I changed my mind.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Because I&#x2019;d rather be with you.&#x201d;<br></p></p><h2>The Lavender Garden: A Novel</h2><p><i>Note to readers: In the UK, this book is published under the title </i>The Light Behind the Window<i>.</i><br> <br><b>An aristocratic French family, a legendary ch�teau, and buried secrets with the power to destroy two generations torn between duty and desire.</b><br><br><i>La C�te d&#x2019;Azur, 1998: </i>In the sun-dappled south of France, Emilie de la Martini�res, the last of her gilded line, inherits her childhood home, a magnificent ch�teau and vineyard.

As she watched, it seemed that, while Val�rie&#x2019;s soul departed her body, the pain that had contorted her features was disappearing too, enabling Emilie to look past the emaciated face and remember the beauty her mother had once possessed.<br> <br>&#x201c;She has left us,&#x201d; murmured Phillipe, the doctor, pointlessly.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;<br> <br>Behind her, she heard the doctor muttering a prayer, but had no thought to join him in it. Instead, she stared down in morbid wonder at the sack of slowly graying flesh which was all that remained of the presence that had dominated her life for thirty years. Emilie instinctively wanted to prod her mother awake, because the transition from life to death&#x2014;given the force of nature Val�rie de la Martini�res had been&#x2014;was too much for her senses to accept.<br> <br>She wasn&#x2019;t sure how she should feel. After all, she had played this moment over in her head on many occasions in the past few weeks. Emilie turned away from her dead mother&#x2019;s face and gazed out the window at the wisps of cloud suspended like uncooked meringues in the blue sky. Through the open window, she could hear the faint cry of a lark come to herald the spring.<br> <br>Rising slowly, her legs stiff from the long nighttime hours she had been sitting vigil, she walked over to the window. The early-morning vista had none of the heaviness that the passing of the hours would eventually bring. Nature had painted a fresh picture as it did every dawn, the soft Proven�al palette of umber, green, and azure gently ushering in the new day. Emilie gazed across the terrace and the formal gardens to the undulating vineyards that surrounded the house and spread across the earth for as far as her eyes could see. The view was simply magnificent and had remained unchanged for centuries. Ch�teau de la Martini�res had been her sanctuary as a child, a place of peace and safety; its tranquillity was indelibly printed into every synapse of her brain.<br> <br>And now it was hers&#x2014;though whether her mother had left anything behind from her financial excesses to continue to fund its upkeep, Emilie did not know.<br> <br>&#x201c;Mademoiselle Emilie, I&#x2019;ll leave you alone so you may say goodbye.&#x201d; The doctor&#x2019;s voice broke into her thoughts. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll take myself downstairs to fill out the necessary form. I am so very sorry.&#x201d; He gave her a small bow and left the room.<br> <br>Am I sorry . . . ?<br> <br>The question flashed unbidden through Emilie&#x2019;s mind. She walked back to the chair and sat down once more, trying to find answers to the many questions her mother&#x2019;s death posed, wanting a resolution, to add and subtract the conflicting emotional columns to produce a definitive feeling. This was, of course, impossible. The woman who lay so pathetically still&#x2014;so harmless to her now, yet such a confusing influence while she had lived&#x2014;would always bring the discomfort of complexity.<br> <br>Val�rie had given her daughter life, she had fed and clothed her and provided a substantial roof over Emilie&#x2019;s head. She had never beaten or abused her.<br> <br>She simply had not noticed her.<br> <br>Val�rie had been&#x2014;Emilie searched for the word&#x2014;disinterested. Which had rendered her, as her daughter, invisible.<br> <br>Emilie reached out her hand and put it on top of her mother&#x2019;s.<br> <br>&#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t see me, Maman . . . you didn&#x2019;t see . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>Emilie was painfully aware that her birth had been a reluctant nod to the need to produce an heir for the de la Martini�res line; a requirement contrived out of duty, not maternal desire for a child. And faced with an &#x201c;heiress&#x201d; rather than the requisite male, Val�rie had been further disinterested. Too old to conceive again&#x2014;Emilie had been born in the very last flush of her mother&#x2019;s fertility at forty-three&#x2014;Val�rie had continued her life as one of Paris&#x2019;s most charming, generous, and beautiful hostesses. Emilie&#x2019;s birth and subsequent presence had seemed to hold as much importance for Val�rie as the acquisition of a further Chihuahua to add to the three she already owned. Like the dogs, Emilie was produced from the nursery and petted in company when it suited Maman to do so. At least the dogs had the comfort of one another, Emilie mused, whereas she had spent vast tracts of her childhood alone.<br> <br>Nor had it helped that she&#x2019;d inherited the de la Martini�res features rather than the delicate, petite blondness of her mother&#x2019;s Slavic ancestors. Emilie had been a stocky child, her olive skin and thick, mahogany hair&#x2014;trimmed every six weeks into a bob, the fringe forming a heavy line above her dark eyebrows&#x2014;a genetic gift from her father, �douard.<br> <br>&#x201c;I look at you sometimes, my dear, and can hardly believe you are the child I gave birth to!&#x201d; her mother would comment on one of her rare visits to the nursery on her way out to the opera. &#x201c;But at least you have my eyes.&#x201d;<br> <br>Emilie wished sometimes she could tear the deep-blue orbs out of their sockets and replace them with her father&#x2019;s beautiful hazel eyes. She didn&#x2019;t think they fitted in her face, and besides, every time she looked through them into the mirror, she saw her mother.<br> <br>It had often seemed to Emilie that she had been born without any gift her mother might value. Taken to ballet lessons at the age of three, Emilie found that her body refused to contort itself into the required positions. As the other little girls fluttered around the studio like butterflies, she struggled to find physical grace. Her small, wide feet enjoyed being planted firmly on the earth, and any attempt to separate them from it resulted in failure. Piano lessons had been equally unsuccessful, and as for singing, she was tone-deaf.<br> <br>Neither did her body accommodate well the feminine dresses her mother insisted she wear if a soiree was taking place in the exquisite, rose-filled garden at the back of the Paris house&#x2014;the setting for Val�rie&#x2019;s famous parties. Tucked away on a seat in the corner, Emilie would marvel at the elegant, charming, and beautiful woman floating between her guests with such gracious professionalism. During the many social occasions at the Paris house and then in the summer at the ch�teau in Gassin, Emilie would feel tongue-tied and uncomfortable. On top of everything else, it seemed she had not inherited her mother&#x2019;s social ease.<br> <br>Yet, to the outsider, it would have seemed she&#x2019;d had everything. A fairy-tale childhood&#x2014;living in a beautiful house in Paris, her family from a long line of French nobility stretching back centuries, and with the inherited wealth still intact after the war years&#x2014;it was a scenario that many other young French girls could only dream of.<br> <br>At least she&#x2019;d had her beloved papa. Although no more attentive to her than Maman, due to his obsession with his ever-growing collection of rare books, which he kept at their ch�teau, when Emilie did manage to catch his attention, he gave her the love and affection she craved.<br> <br>Papa had been sixty when she was born and died when she was fourteen. Time spent together had been rare, but Emilie had understood that much of her personality was derived from him. �douard was quiet and thoughtful, preferring his books and the peace of the ch�teau to the constant flow of acquaintances Maman brought into their homes. Emilie had often pondered just how two such polar opposites had fallen in love in the first place. Yet �douard seemed to adore his younger wife, made no complaint at her lavish lifestyle, even though he lived more frugally himself, and was proud of her beauty and popularity on the Paris social scene.<br> <br>Often, when summer had come to an end and it was time for Val�rie and Emilie to return to Paris, Emilie would beg her father to let her stay.<br> <br>&#x201c;Papa, I love it here in the countryside with you. There is a school in the village . . . I could go there and look after you, because you must be so lonely here at the ch�teau by yourself.&#x201d;<br> <br>�douard would chuck her chin affectionately, but shake his head. &#x201c;No, little one. As much as I love you, you must return to Paris to learn both your lessons and how to become a lady like your mother.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But, Papa, I don&#x2019;t want to go back with Maman, I want to stay here, with you . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>And then, when she was thirteen . . . Emilie blinked away sudden tears, still unable to return to the moment when her mother&#x2019;s disinterest had turned to neglect. She would suffer the consequences of it for the rest of her life.<br> <br>&#x201c;How could you not see or care what was happening to me, Maman? I was your daughter!&#x201d;<br> <br>A sudden flicker of one of Val�rie&#x2019;s eyes caused Emilie to jump in fear that, in fact, Maman was still alive after all and had heard the words she had just spoken. Trained to know the signs, Emilie checked Val�rie&#x2019;s wrist for a pulse and found none. It was, of course, the last physical vestige of life as her muscles relaxed into death.<br> <br>&#x201c;Maman, I will try to forgive you. I will try to understand, but just now I cannot say whether I&#x2019;m happy or sad that you are dead.&#x201d; Emilie could feel her own breathing stiffening, a defense mechanism against the pain of speaking the words out loud. &#x201c;I loved you so much, tried so hard to please you, to gain your love and attention, to feel . . . worthy as your daughter. My God! I did everything!&#x201d; Emilie balled her hands into fists. &#x201c;You were my mother!&#x201d;<br> <br>The sound of her own voice echoing across the vast bedroom shocked her into silence. She stared at the de la Martini�res family crest, painted 250 years ago onto the majestic headboard. Fading now, the two wild boars locked in combat with the ubiquitous fleur-de-lis and the motto, &#x201c;Victory Is All,&#x201d; emblazoned below were barely legible.<br> <br>She shivered suddenly, although the room was warm. The silence in the ch�teau was deafening. A house once filled with life was now an empty husk, housing only the past. She glanced down at the signet ring on the smallest finger of her right hand, depicting the family crest in miniature. She was the last surviving de la Martini�res.<br> <br>Emilie felt the sudden weight of centuries of ancestors upon her shoulders, and the sadness of a great and noble lineage reduced to one unmarried and childless thirty-year-old woman. The family had borne the ravages of hundreds of years of brutality, but the First and Second World Wars had seen only her father survive.<br> <br>At least there would be none of the usual scrapping over the inheritance. Due to an outdated Napoleonic law, all brothers and sisters directly inherited their parents&#x2019; property equally. Many was the family who had been brought to near ruin by one child who refused to agree to sell. Sadly, in this case, les h�ritiers en ligne directe amounted simply to her.<br> <br>Emilie sighed. Sell she might have to, but those were thoughts for another day. Now it was time to say good-bye.<br> <br>&#x201c;Rest in peace, Maman.&#x201d; She placed a light kiss on top of the graying forehead, then crossed herself. Rising wearily from the chair, Emilie left the room, closing the door firmly behind her.</p><h2>A Beautiful Child: A True Story of Hope, Horror, and an Enduring Human Spirit</h2><p><b>Sharon Marshall was a brilliant and beautiful student whose future was filled with promise&#x2014;until her murderous, fugitive father drew her into a lifetime of deception that became one of the most baffling cases in the annals of American true crime.</b><br><br>A student at Forest Park High School near Atlanta, Georgia, popular blonde-haired Sharon Marshall was at the top of her class.

The stresses of pastoring are well known and can be a match for even the best-prepared, most experienced in ministry--multiple tasks, long hours, taxing responsibilities and, yes, some challenging personalities. Too often the results can be burnout, being run out or just feeling worn out. To find out how pastors can thrive as well as survive, the authors undertook a five-year in-depth research project among working pastors. Here in this ground-breaking book is the distilled wisdom of dozens of pastors who have been on the front lines of ministry. We hear from them what works, what doesn&#39;t and what distinctive issues people in ministry face. The authors uncover five key themes that promote healthy, sustainable ministry that lasts--spiritual formation, self-care, emotional and cultural intelligence, marriage and family, leadership and management. These themes are unpacked from the vantage point of ministry on the ground. Questions for personal evaluation and reflection are included throughout the book to bring home the significance of each section. This is the perfect companion for a peer cohort of pastors to read together. It can also be of value to church boards and others who want to better understand how to help sustain their pastors in ministry. In short, this is a book pastors can&#39;t live without.</p><p><strong>Bob Burns</strong> (Ph.D., University of Georgia) is senior associate pastor and head of staff at Central Presbyterian Church in St. Louis, and adjunct professor of educational ministries at Covenant Theological Seminary.<br><br><strong>Tasha D.

As a result, this book needs to be required reading not just for theological educators and judicatory and denominational officials, but also for pastors (and pastors' spouses) and lay leaders--everyone who cares about Christ, his church and his ministers. If Christ's church advances, it will only be through ministerial leaders who are resilient, committed, sustained and growing. Burns and company show us the way."

But it also provides one-of-a-kind leadership training to cutting-edge companies, nonprofits, and public sector organizations&#x2014;all aimed at increasing creativity, collaboration, and teamwork.</p><p>The rules for leadership and teamwork have changed, and the skills that got professionals ahead a generation ago don&#x2019;t work anymore. Now The Second City provides a new toolkit individuals and organizations can use to thrive in a world increasingly shaped by speed, social communication, and decentralization. Based on eight principles of improvisation, <em>Yes, And</em> helps to develop these skills and foster them in high-potential leaders and their teams, including:&nbsp;</p><ul> <li> Mastering the ability to co-create in an ensemble</li> <li> Fostering a &#x201c;yes, and&#x201d; approach to work</li> <li> Embracing failure to accelerate high performance</li> <li> Leading by listening and by learning to follow</li> <li> Innovating by making something out of nothing</li></ul><p><em>Yes, And</em> is a must-read for professionals and organizations, helping to develop the invaluable leadership skills needed to succeed today.</p></p><p><p>The Second City has launched the careers of celebrated comic performers such as Tina Fey and Stephen Colbert and produced award-winning content. But it's the actual improvisational process developed and honed over the years by The Second City that has become its legacy. Players master an ability to co-create in ensembles, using philosophies that celebrate a "Yes, And" approach. They embrace authenticity and failure, and espouse the idea of "following the follower," which allows any member of the team to assume a leadership role.</p><p>For more than two decades, The Second City has taken these same principles in thousands of corporate clients, showing leaders how to apply the tools of improv to common business challenges. Here, for the first time, Second City executives Kelly Leonard and Tom Yorton describe how you can use the same skills that thrill audiences around the world to improve your emotional intelligence, increase creativity, and learn to pivot out of tight and uncomfortable situations. In this engaging, often humorous, and highly practical book, you will learn how to become a more compelling leader and a more collaborative follower by employing the seven elements of improv:</p><ul> <li> <em>Yes, And</em>, by which you give every idea a chance to be acted on;</li> <li> <em>Ensemble</em>, reconciling the needs of individuals with those of the broader team;</li> <li> <em>Co-creation</em>, which highlights the importance of dialogue in creating new products, processes, and relationships;</li> <li> <em>Authenticity</em>, or being unafraid to speak truth to power, challenge convention, and break the rules;</li> <li> <em>Failure</em>, teaching us that not only is it okay to fail, but we should always include it as part of our process;</li> <li> <em>Follow the Follower</em>, which gives any member of the group the chance to assume a leadership role;</li> <li> <em>Listening</em>, in which you learn to stay in the moment, and know the difference between listening to understand and listening merely to respond.</li></ul><p>When we are fiercely following the tenets of improvisation, we generate ideas both quickly and efficiently, we weather storms with more aplomb, and we don't work burdened by a fear of failure. Even better, these qualities are fully transferable to our lives outside the office.</p><p>More people are beginning to recognize what The Second City has known for a long time: In the midst of a revolution in how we learn, communicate, and work, professional success often rests on the same pillars that form the foundation of great comedy: Creativity, Communication, and Collaboration. That's where improvisation comes in.</p><p>Kelly Leonard is the executive vice president of The Second City and the president of Second City Theatricals. He has worked at The Second City since 1988 and has overseen productions with such notable performers as Stephen Colbert, Tina Fey, and Amy Poehler. Mr. Leonard cofounded Second City Theatricals, the division of the company that develops an eclectic array of live entertainment all over the world. He has fostered creative and business collaborations with Lyric Opera Chicago, Norwegian Cruise Line, Hubbard Street Dance and the Chicago Tribune, to name a few.</p><br><br><p>Tom Yorton has been CEO of Second City Works, the b2b arm of The Second City, since 2002. Before joining The Second City family, Tom worked in advertising and marketing at agencies like Ogilvy, Grey, and Hal Riney before jumping to the client side, with stints as a marketing vice president at Sears and 3Com, where he actually hired Second City Works on a couple of occasions. Second City Works now does more than four hundred engagements a year, half with Fortune 1000 companies. Tom and his team are focused on refining The Second City's unique capabilities&#x2014;creating funny short-form content and using improv to develop vital skills in businesspeople&#x2014;to help companies communicate, collaborate, and innovate better in a web-first, social-everything world. </p></p><h2>Revelation (Catholic Commentary on Sacred Scripture)</h2><p>In this addition to the well-received Catholic Commentary on Sacred Scripture (CCSS), seasoned New Testament scholar and popular speaker Peter Williamson interprets Revelation from within the living tradition of the Church for pastoral ministers, lay readers, and students alike. The seventeen-volume CCSS series, which will cover the entire New Testament, relates Scripture to Christian life today, is faithfully Catholic, and is supplemented by features designed to help readers understand the Bible more deeply and use it more effectively in teaching, preaching, evangelization, and other forms of ministry. Drawn from the best of contemporary scholarship, series volumes are keyed to the liturgical year and include an index of pastoral subjects.</p><p>"Peter Williamson has written a balanced, clear, informative, and insightful commentary on Revelation that is both Catholic and catholic. Attentive to the first-century context, the history of interpretation, and Christian liturgy and life, it offers us--like Revelation itself--guidance for the spiritual struggle between the first and second comings of the Lord."<br>--<b>Michael&nbsp;J. Gorman</b>, Raymond&nbsp;E. Brown Professor of Biblical Studies and Theology, St. Mary's Seminary and University, Baltimore<br><br>"Dr. Williamson, drawing on the best scholarship, has done an excellent job making sense out of a book that is notoriously difficult to interpret. Academically sound, pastorally useful, spiritually inspiring. Highly recommended."<br>--<b>Ralph Martin, STD</b>, director of Graduate Theology Programs in the New Evangelization, Sacred Heart Major Seminary, Archdiocese of Detroit<br><br>"Peter Williamson's commentary on the book of Revelation is well balanced and judicious on issues of the book's authorship, date, composition, and structure, thus aiding readers in making well-informed decisions that draw on Williamson's familiarity with modern scholarship and the patristic discussions of Revelation. His explanations of the various images throughout Revelation, set within a clear, sensible presentation of the structure of the whole book, allow the pieces of the puzzle of this book to fall into place and enable the reader to better understand its first-century background and its vision of the final victory of God and his Church over Satan and his kingdom. Throughout the book, the author draws out the ongoing significance of Revelation for the life of the Church in every era between the time of its writing and its ultimate fulfillment. I highly commend this commentary."<br>--<b>Fr. Mitchell C.

For the first time, he gives an intimate look at his family background, his battles with drugs, his life of crime, his relentless suffering with sickle-cell anemia, and much more. Recently released after serving three and a half years in state prison due to what many consider an unlawful arrest by a rumored secret NYPD hip hop task force, Prodigy is ready to talk about his life as one of rap&#x2019;s greatest legends.<br> <br><i>My Infamous Life</i> is an unblinking account of Prodigy&#x2019;s wild times with Mobb Deep who, alongside rappers like Nas, The Notorious B.I.G., Tupac Shakur, Jay-Z, and Wu-Tang Clan, changed the musical landscape with their vivid portrayals of early &#x2019;90s street life. It is a firsthand chronicle of legendary rap feuds like the East Coast&#x2013;West Coast rivalry; Prodigy&#x2019;s beefs with Jay-Z, Nas, Snoop Dogg, Ja Rule, and Capone-N-Noreaga; and run-ins with prodigal hit makers and managers like Puff Daddy, Russell Simmons, Chris Lighty, Irv Gotti, and Lyor Cohen.<br> <br>Taking the reader behind the smoke-and-mirrors glamour of the hip hop world, so often seen as the only way out for those with few options, Prodigy lays down the truth about the intoxicating power of money, the meaning of true friendship and loyalty, and the ultimately redemptive power of self. This is the heartbreaking journey of a child born in privilege, his youth spent among music royalty like Diana Ross and Dizzy Gillespie, educated in private schools, until a family tragedy changed everything. Raised in the mayhem of the Queensbridge projects, Prodigy rose to the dizzying heights of fame and eventually fell into the darkness of a prison cell.<br> <br>A truly candid memoir, part fearless confessional and part ode to the concrete jungles of New York City, from the front line of the last great moment in hip hop history.</p><p>Albert &#x201c;Prodigy&#x201d; Johnson was one half of the platinum selling hip-hop duo, Mobb Deep.

A smart, contemporary story told through texts and emails." - Seira Wilson, Amazon Editor<br><br><b>From two extraordinary authors comes a moving, exuberant, laugh-out-loud novel about friendship and family, told entirely in emails and letters.</b><br><br>Avery Bloom, who's bookish, intense, and afraid of many things, particularly deep water, lives in New York City. Bett Devlin, who's fearless, outgoing, and loves all animals as well as the ocean, lives in California. What they have in common is that they are both twelve years old, and are both being raised by single, gay dads.<br><br>When their dads fall in love, Bett and Avery are sent, against their will, to the same sleepaway camp. Their dads hope that they will find common ground and become friends--and possibly, one day, even sisters. <br><br>But things soon go off the rails for the girls (and for their dads too), and they find themselves on a summer adventure that neither of them could have predicted.

Written in an epistolary format, it is a thoroughly current story told through e-mail exchanges between two 12-year-old girls. Avery Bloom receives an e-mail entitled "You don't know me" from one Bett Devlin, informing her their fathers are in love, and that they have devised a plan for the tweens to meet at a summer camp. Initially reticent, the girls plot to sabotage their fathers' plans until they realize they may have more in common than they had realized. They find in each other a confidant with whom they can share the stresses of adolescence and they form a friendship sustained by humor and vulnerability. This is a convincing and heartwarming look into the experiences of female friendship and is enhanced by the charming and riveting love story between the girls' fathers. While remaining lighthearted, the narrative successfully weaves in important topics like puberty, religion, surrogacy, race, and sexual orientation, reminiscent of Judy Blume's signature style.

Big Anthony is supposed to look after her house and tend her garden, but one day, when she goes over the mountain to visit Strega Amelia, he recites the magic verse over the pasta pot, with disastrous results.</p><p><strong>Eric Carle and Tomie dePaola: Author One-on-One</strong> <br> <br> <strong>Eric Carle</strong> is the creator, author, and illustrator of <i>The Very Hungry Caterpillar</i> and many other children&#x2019;s books. <strong>Tomie dePaola</strong> is the author and illustrator of <i>Strega Nona: Her Story</i> and countless other books. They recently had a conversation about their careers as picture book authors. <br> <br> <strong>Tomie dePaola:</strong> When I was only four years old, I announced to my family in particular and to the world in general that I was going to become an artist, and write stories and draw pictures for books. I never swayed from that early declaration. I&#x2019;ve always been curious to know, what inspired you to become a creator and illustrator of picture books? <br> <br> <strong>Eric Carle:</strong> My career began as a graphic designer and for a number of years I worked as an art director for an advertising agency in New York. In the mid 1960's Bill Martin, Jr. saw an ad of a red lobster that I had designed and asked me to illustrate his <i>Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See?</i> Well, I was set on fire! I was so inspired by this book, and the opportunity to illustrate it changed my life. After that, I started to create my own books, both words and pictures, and really it was then that I had found my true course in life. <br> <br> Now, I have a question for you, Tomie. How would you describe your artistic style, and has it changed over time? <br> <br> <strong>Tomie dePaola:</strong> My illustration style is heavily influenced by folk art--strong simple shapes, bold lines, color, color, color and a deceptive simplicity. My style began to develop early in art school, and through the years, it hasn&#x2019;t changed very much, but it has refined itself. How would you describe yours? <br> <br> <strong>Eric Carle:</strong> My aim with my work is to simplify and refine, be logical and harmonious. I like to use simple shapes, bright colors and a lot of white space. I write for the child inside of me. That is always where I begin. <br> <br> <strong>Tomie dePaola:</strong> I do, as well. The only audience I keep in mind is that four-year-old in me. People sometimes ask me what advice I would give to young artists. I always think of the wonderful advice I received from my twin cousins when they were in art school in the late '30s. They told me, &#x201c;Practice, practice, practice and don&#x2019;t copy.&#x201d; <br> <br> <strong>Eric Carle:</strong> I often tell people about the four magic letters: DO IT. I want to be encouraging but I can only offer the example of my own experience, which is just one approach. There are many wonderful artists to learn about, which is important. But you must use your own imagination. You have to just do it. <br> <br> <strong>Tomie dePaola:</strong> How do you feel knowing that a copy of <i>The Very Hungry Caterpillar</i> is sold every 30 seconds, somewhere in the world? <br> <br> <strong>Eric Carle:</strong> It is hard for me, maybe for others too, to grasp this concept. But I am truly honored that my story is enjoyed by so many and that it is now being shared by a generation of parents who grew up with my book. How about your <i>Strega Nona</i>. She is one of your most popular characters. Can you share how she came to be? <br> <br> <strong>Tomie dePaola:</strong> In the &#x2018;70s when I was teaching at a college, we were required to attend faculty meetings. I always sat in the back with a yellow legal pad. Everyone thought I was taking notes. At one meeting a doodle appeared of a little lady with a big nose and a big chin. I named her Strega Nona, and the rest is history. Speaking of history, how will you be celebrating the third annual <i>Very Hungry Caterpillar</i> Day this year? <br> <br> <strong>Eric Carle:</strong> On <i>The Very Hungry Caterpillar</i> Day, March 20th, I will probably be at home with my wife, Bobbie (I am a bit of a hermit, actually). But I will be saying a little toast to the caterpillar for whom I have a special place in my heart. And speaking of holidays, isn&#x2019;t your favorite holiday Christmas. Do you have a special Christmas memory? <br> <br> <strong>Tomie dePaola:</strong> Christmas is my favorite holiday. My favorite Christmas was the one when I received tons and tons of art supplies: everything from an easel to paints, pads and pads of paper, and &#x201c;how to draw&#x201d; books. <br>Tomie dePaola is one of the most popular children&#x2019;s book authors and illustrators of our time and the winner of the 2011 Children&#x2019;s Literature Legacy Award&nbsp;(formerly known as the Laura Ingalls Wilder Award), among other lifetime achievement awards.&nbsp;A Newbery Honor winner, he has written and illustrated a number of books, including Caldecott Honor book&nbsp;<i>Strega Nona&nbsp;</i>and its companions, as well as&nbsp;<i>Oliver Button Is a Sissy</i>;&nbsp;<i>The Legend of Old Befana</i>;&nbsp;<i>The Clown of God</i>;&nbsp;<i>Michael Bird-Boy</i>;&nbsp;<i>Andy, That&#x2019;s My Name</i>; and the&nbsp;<i>New York Times&nbsp;</i>bestseller&nbsp;<i>Quiet</i>.

He still lives there with his family, forty years later, and has no plans to move anytime soon. Author of more than sixty published short stories and twenty-nine novels for readers of all ages, he has been published around the world in numerous languages, online, and in spoken-word editions. He is a judge for the Writers of the Future contest, which he won in 1993. He is also a multiple winner of Australia&#x2019;s speculative fiction awards and recently received both the Ditmar and the Aurealis for The Crooked Letter, marking the first time in the history of the awards that a fantasy novel has won both.Chapter 1<br><br>The life of Darth Vader&#x2019;s secret student took a strange and deadly turn the day his Master first spoke of General Rahm Kota.<br><br>He&#x2019;d had no warning that a moment of such significance was approaching. During his nightly meditations, kneeling on the metal floor of his chamber while construction droids built the Executor, unaware of his existence, he had seen no visions in the pure, angry red of the lightsaber that he held like a burning brand in front of his eyes. Although he had stared until the world vanished and the dark side flowed through him in a bloody tide, the future had remained closed.<br><br>Nothing, therefore, prepared him for the sudden deviation from the day&#x2019;s punishing and unpredictable exercises. His Master was not a patient teacher; neither was he a talkative one. He preferred action to debate, just as he preferred recrimination to reward. Never once in all the days they had sparred together, with lightsaber, telekinesis, or suggestion, had the Dark Lord offered a single word of encouragement. And that was as it should be, he knew. A teacher&#x2019;s job was not to drag a student along a single, well-worn path. Rather it was to let the student forge his or her own way through the forest, intervening only when the student was hopelessly lost and needed to be corrected.<br><br>Even on the wrong paths, he knew, lay some wisdom. What didn&#x2019;t kill him only made him more powerful in the dark side.<br><br>And there had been many, many times he had thought he might die . . .<br><br>Breathing heavily after a punishing round of blows, lightsaber lowered in submission, he knelt before his Master and prepared for the killing strike. He could feel the wrath radiating from the Dark Lord like heat&#x2014;a visceral, angry heat that brought out his skin in gooseflesh. For a moment that seemed to stretch for years, all he could hear was the regular, implacable respiration that kept the man inside the mask alive.<br><br>&#x201c;You were weak when I found you.&#x201d; The voice seemed to come from the far end of a long, deep tunnel. &#x201c;You should never have survived my training.&#x201d;<br><br>He closed his eyes. He had heard these words before. They were the closest thing to a bedtime story he&#x2019;d had as a child. The moral he had taken from them was burned into his mind: Learn . . . or die.<br><br>Behind his eyelids he pictured again the clean, cleansing heat of the lightsaber. He had brushed his skin against it many times, defying the pain, and taken numerous small wounds while dueling with his Master. He imagined that he knew what the blade would feel like when it struck him down. Part of him longed for it.<br><br>The lightsaber drifted so close to his neck that he could smell his hair burning.<br><br>&#x201c;But now, your hatred has become your strength.&#x201d;<br><br>The lightsaber retreated. With a hiss it deactivated.<br><br>&#x201c;At last, the dark side is your ally.&#x201d;<br><br>He didn&#x2019;t dare nod or look up. What was this? Some new ruse to lure him into overconfidence and failure?<br><br>His Master&#x2019;s next words made his heart trip a beat.<br><br>&#x201c;Rise, my apprentice.&#x201d;<br><br>Apprentice. So he had always thought himself, but never before had it been said aloud! And that strange motion with the lightsaber . . . Could he possibly have just been knighted?<br><br>His lightsaber retracted. It was all he could do to balance on knees that felt suddenly made of rubber. The black shape looming over him was unreadable, limned with crimson from the light of the star shining through the wide viewport to their right. Metal, angular, and functional, the space around them was as familiar to him as the scars on the back of his hand, but suddenly, disconcertingly, everything seemed different.<br><br>The apprentice kept his eyes up and his voice level.<br><br>&#x201c;What is your will, my Master?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You have defeated many of my rivals. Your training is nearly complete. It is time now to face your first true test.&#x201d;<br><br>A roll call of past missions sped through the apprentice&#x2019;s mind. Lord Vader had instructed him to dispatch numerous enemies within the Empire down the years: spies and thieves, mainly, with the occasional high-ranking traitor as well. He felt only satisfaction at having fulfilled his duty. His victims had brought their fates upon themselves, these vermin that gnawed at the footings of the Empire&#x2019;s magnificent edifice.<br><br>But this was different. He could sense it in more than his Master&#x2019;s words. Darth Vader wasn&#x2019;t talking about some low-life smuggler with no awareness at all of the Force. There could be only one foe he was worthy to fight now.<br><br>&#x201c;Your spies have located a Jedi?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes. General Rahm Kota.&#x201d; The name meant nothing to the apprentice: just one of many in an archive of unconfirmed Jedi kills. &#x201c;He is attacking a critical shipyard above Nar Shaddaa. You will destroy him and bring me his lightsaber.&#x201d;<br><br>Excitement filled the apprentice. He had trained and hoped for this moment as long as he could remember. At last it had come. He could never truly call himself a Sith until he had taken the life of one of his Master&#x2019;s traditional enemies.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll leave at once, Master.&#x201d;<br><br>He had taken barely a step toward the door when Darth Vader&#x2019;s irresistible voice stopped him. &#x201c;The Emperor cannot discover you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;As you wish, my Master.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Leave no witnesses. Kill everyone aboard, Imperials and insurgents alike.&#x201d;<br><br>The apprentice nodded, keeping his sudden uncertainty carefully clouded.<br><br>&#x201c;Do not fail in this.&#x201d;<br><br>The lightsaber hanging back at his hip was a comforting, reassuring weight. &#x201c;No, my lord,&#x201d; he said, back straight and voice firm.<br><br>Darth Vader turned away and gripped his hands behind his back. The red sun painted his helmet with lava highlights.<br><br>Thus dismissed, his secret apprentice hurried about his latest, darkest duty.<br>General Rahm Kota.<br><br>The name ran through his mind as he hurried through the warren connecting his Master&#x2019;s secret chambers. They were sparse, functional spaces, consisting of a meditation chamber, a droid workshop, sleeping quarters large enough for one, and a hangar deck. All were on a concealed level of Darth Vader&#x2019;s flagship, a space long since written out of the floor plans; it would go unnoticed by the future crew.<br><br>The Emperor cannot discover you.<br><br>Excited though he was by the thought of hunting Jedi, the reminder of the goal his Master allowed him to share was instantly sobering. All his life he had been trained to turn fear into anger, and anger into power. It was no different, he realized, for Darth Vader. Where else could Lord Vader look for increased power than to the Emperor himself? People were either predators or prey. That was one of the most basic rules of life. Together, Darth Vader and his apprentice would ensure that their joint power only increased.<br><br>But first he had to survive an encounter with a Jedi. That his Master had found one at liberty was unsurprising. A handful were suspected to have survived the Great Jedi Purge, and none was more adept at finding them than Darth Vader. The dark side infiltrated every corner of the galaxy; nothing could remain hidden from it forever. Perhaps one day, the apprentice thought, he, too, could seek out his enemies by their thoughts and feelings alone, but like the visions of the future that were closed to him, that ability remained elusive. He had never met a Jedi. Their natures were mysterious to him.<br><br>Their history, however, was not. His Master set no lesson plans or written examinations, but Darth Vader did give him access to records surviving from the Republic and the Order he had helped unseat from its position of undeserved privilege. The apprentice had devoted himself to the study, understanding that knowledge of his enemy might mean the difference one day between life and death.<br><br>General Rahm Kota.<br><br>The name still brought forth no details of combat styles, character, or last sightings from his memory. He would access the records when he reached the Rogue Shadow. There would be time to research on the journey to Nar Shaddaa. If he dug deeply enough, he might find some small detail that would give him an edge when he most needed one. That was the only preparation he required.<br><br>Entering the hangar bay, he wound his way through the familiar maze of crates, weapons racks, and starfighter parts. The ambient lighting was dim, with shadows pooling in every corner. The air tasted of metal and ozone&#x2014;a sharp stink that had by now become very familiar. For some, the underbelly of a Star Destroyer might have seemed a strange place to grow up, but for him it was a comfort to be surrounded by such unambiguous symbols of technological and political power. Ships like these had patrolled the trade lanes of the galaxy for years. They had put down insurrections and quashed resistance around hundreds of worlds. Where else would a Sith apprentice live and learn?<br><br>Kill everyone aboard, Imperials and insurgents alike. Leave no witnesses.<br><br>Even as he mulled over this new development, a familiar snap-hiss sounded to his right and a glowing blue-white blade sprang into life in a dark corner of the hangar. A brown-robed figure ran forward, weapon raised.<br><br>Instantly in a fighting crouch, the apprentice brought his own blade up to block the blow, teeth bared in a delighted snarl.<br><br>He and his adversary held the pose for a bare second, lightsabers locked across their chests. The apprentice quickly sized up the being who had attacked him. Human male, fair-haired and bearded, with calm, serious eyes and a firm set to his jaw. Anyone within living memory of the Clone Wars&#x2014;or possessing free access to the Jedi Archives&#x2014;would have recognized him immediately.<br><br>Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, High General of the Galactic Republic and master of the Soresu form of lightsaber combat, slid his deadly blade down and to the right, ducking at the same time to avoid the inevitable countersweep. Sparks flew as the apprentice Force-leapt high into the air and landed with perfect agility on top of a stack of crates. He reached out with his cupped left hand and swept a metal tool kit across the hangar bay, toward his opponent&#x2019;s head. Kenobi ducked and leapt up after him, deflecting a flurry of blows that would have left an ordinary man in pieces, then responding with a sweep of his own that sent the apprentice dodging backward, jumping from one stack to another in temporary retreat.<br><br>So the duel proceeded for almost a minute, with Kenobi and the apprentice dancing like acrobatic Gados from stack to stack, lightsabers spinning and clashing, racks and tools turned into temporary weapons as they hurled themselves from one to the other. The racket was enormous, and the threat very real. Kenobi slashed a new rip in the sleeve of the apprentice&#x2019;s combat suit with a move that would have taken his arm off at the elbow had he not moved in time. Twice he felt rather than saw the Jedi&#x2019;s blade sweep over his head.<br><br>The apprentice wasn&#x2019;t afraid of dying. His only fear was of failing his Master, and that fear he put to good use. The dark side rushed through him, made him strong and resilient. He felt more powerful than he ever had before.<br><br>Vader was sending him to hunt one of his old foes&#x2014;and how better to warm up for the mission than by killing the man who had once been among the most famous Jedi in the galaxy?<br><br>Alive with murderous intent, the apprentice rushed forward, his red blade swinging, to finish the job.</p><h2>The Curse of the Pharaohs (Amelia Peabody, 2)</h2><p><b>Egyptologist Amelia Peabody, now a wife and mother, returns in another Victorian-era mystery--to catch a murderer at an excavation of an ancient tomb.</b><br> It's 1892, and Amelia and her now-husband Radcliffe Emerson have settled down in Victorian England after their escapade in Egypt.

How has the movement variously called Word of Faith, Health and Wealth, Name It and Claim It, or simply prosperity gospel come to dominate much of our contemporary religious landscape?<br><br>Kate Bowler's <em>Blessed </em>is the first book to fully explore the origins, unifying themes, and major figures of a burgeoning movement that now claims millions of followers in America. Bowler traces the roots of the prosperity gospel: from the touring mesmerists, metaphysical sages, pentecostal healers, business oracles, and princely prophets of the early 20th century; through mid-century positive thinkers like Norman Vincent Peale and revivalists like Oral Roberts and Kenneth Hagin; to today's hugely successful prosperity preachers. Bowler focuses on such contemporary figures as Creflo Dollar, pastor of Atlanta's 30,000-member World Changers Church International; Joel Osteen, known as "the smiling preacher," with a weekly audience of seven million; T. D. Jakes, named by <em>Time</em> magazine one of America's most influential new religious leaders; Joyce Meyer, evangelist and women's empowerment guru; and many others. At almost any moment, day or night, the American public can tune in to these preachers-on TV, radio, podcasts, and in their megachurches-to hear the message that God desires to bless them with wealth and health. Bowler offers an interpretive framework for scholars and general readers alike to understand the diverse expressions of Christian abundance as a cohesive movement bound by shared understandings and common goals.<br></p><p><br><strong>Kate Bowler</strong> is Assistant Professor of American Religion at Duke Divinity School.<br><br>"[A] magnificent study."--<em>Heath W. Carter, Journal of Cultural Economy<p></p></em><br>"Highly entertaining...and deeply human."--David F. Ruccio, <em>Journal of Cultural Economy</em><p></p><br>"Very readable and engaging...<em>Blessed</em> is the best history of the development of the prosperity gospel written to date. It is an important addition to the library of pastors or scholars who regularly encounter the prosperity gospel in their ministry."--<em>Southwestern Journal of Theology</em><p></p><br>"Bowler shows how the prosperity gospel movement has drawn from multiple denominational, racial, ethnic, and even secular subtraditions. She identifies both the dazzling diversity and the common understandings that have given the prosperity gospel coherence" <br>--<em>Christian Century</em><p></p><br>"Bowler's respect for her subjects and her ability to locate them in the larger American religious narrative mean that serious scholars dismiss the prosperity gospel at their own peril. Bowler shows us that its deep roots and vibrant future, even after the recent recession, place it solidly in the category of religious movements to watch." --<em>Church History</em><p></p><br>"Marvelous this is a stunningly empathetic book. By pushing far beyond caricature, Bowler has produced a must-read for anyone who wants to understand the prosperity gospel and how it is, even now, remaking the American religious landscape." --<em>The Christian Century</em><p></p><br>"An important account of an audacious contemporary religious phenomenon." --<em>Booklist</em><p></p><br>"[A] riveting historical account." --<em>Publishers Weekly</em><p></p><br>"The 'prosperity gospel' is as much despised by its detractors as it is embraced by its millions of adherents. Yet until Kate Bowler's <em>Blessed</em>, no one has attempted a balanced, informative, inquisitive survey. Her book is a metaphorical godsend for those with an outsider's curiosity about one of the fastest growing religious movements in contemporary America and a literal one for those inside." -- Mark A. Noll, author of <em>Protestantism: A Very Short Introduction</em> <br><p></p><br>"Though often maligned and misunderstood, Bowler's comprehensive and exciting examination of the prosperity gospel demonstrates the ways 'health and wealth' has been a staple of American Protestant life since the 19th century. <em>Blessed</em> provides a thorough and nuanced account of the phenomenon, as it skillfully examines varying attitudes toward prosperity which emerged across racial, regional, and denominational lines. This is a grand contribution to the field of American religious history." -- Jonathan L. Walton, Plummer Professor of Christian Morals and Professor of Religion and Society, Harvard University<p></p><br>"This book propels Kate Bowler into the first rank of younger historians of religion in America. The author's keen ear, her perceptive insights, and her command of history make this a remarkable and unforgettable book-and her conclusion that the 'prosperity gospel consecrated America's culture of optimism' rings very true." -- Randall Balmer, author of <em>Mine Eyes Have Seen the Glory: A Journey into the Evangelical Subculture in America</em><p></p><br>"<em>Blessed</em> is worthwhile reading for what it is-a history of the prosperity gospel and not a theology of the prosperity movement. I've benefited from time spent working through it and would recommend it to those seeking to learn about this topic." --<em>The Gospel Coalition</em><p></p><br>"<em>Blessed</em> is a good history of the rise and flourishing of the gospel." --<em>The Blade</em><p></p><br>"...[A]n unprecedented historical examination of health and wealth as spiritual subjects in American Christianity by tracing the rise, development, and transformation of the prosperity gospel in the United States." --<em>Religious Studies Review</em> <br><p></p><br></p><h2>Feeling Outnumbered?

For thirty-five years, his journalism focused on health defined broadly, including&nbsp;optimal wellness, mainstream medicine, alternative therapies, nutrition, fitness, and sexuality.&nbsp;Castleman also writes mystery novels set in San Francisco.Except for vague references to folk practices, many books on herbs gloss over their medicinal uses. Not so here. After chapters discussing the history of herbal therapy, the controversies waged over the safety of herbal remedies, and strategies for herb storage and preparation, Castleman offers encyclopedic entries on 100 of the most common healing herbs. Unlike some herbalists, he makes no extravagant claims about the plants; subheadings entitled "Dead-End File" and "The Safety Factor" detail, respectively, what specific herbs won't cure and the herbs' side effects. The author wisely stresses that self-treatment with herbs should never take the place of professional medical care. His informative entries are highly readable and packed with anecdotal lore. A final chapter contains an invaluable table of common ailments, with herbal preventives and treatments included. A list of references and a bibliography finish this very useful volume.

But Carl and Madeleine have plans of their own&#x2015; they want to play in the snow! After getting all bundled up, they sneak off to go sledding, build a snowman, and even make an appearance at the party and try sliding on the ice at the pond. Of course, resourceful Carl gets the baby home before her parents return&#x2015;and the babysitter is never the wiser.</p><p>Everyone's favorite Rottweiler appears here in a wintertime romp.</p></p><p><b>Alexandra Day</b> is the author and illustrator of <i>Good Dog, Carl</i> and the rest of the beloved Carl books, including <i>Carl Goes Shopping</i>, <i>Carl's Christmas</i>, <i>Carl's Birthday</i> and <i>Carl's Snowy Afternoon</i>. The Darlings' own dog, a Rottweiler named Toby, was the original model for the main character of <i>Good Dog, Carl</i>. Since then, two other Darling Rottweilers have posed as Carl in the sequels: the late Arambarri, who was named for one of the Darlings' favorite jai alai players; and Zabala, who currently moonlights as an Our Best Friend therapy dog, visiting hospitals to cheer patients.Carl and Madeleine enjoy a winter's day in this addition to Carl's long string of escapades. Following her series' winning format, Day sets the scene for the duo's shenanigans with minimal text&#x2014;the toddler's mother announces that she and her husband are going to the Pond Party and the TV-watching babysitter suggests that Madeleine eat her snack&#x2014;and then lets lush paintings do the storytelling. They succeed splendidly, revealing cherubic Madeleine and the resourceful rottweiler escaping outdoors via the doggy door, helping neighbors make snowmen, sledding down a hill and catching snowflakes on their tongues. A highlight of their antics involves the two boldly cavorting on the frozen pond close by the girl's oblivious parents, a kid-tickling hallmark of Carl adventures. Pleasingly true to form, the pair manages to sneak back inside minutes before Madeleine's parents return. Among the fun flourishes are views of Carl purloining hot dogs from a vendor's grill and Madeleine, perched on Carl's back, removing a snowman's carrot nose for a hungry bunny. Despite its setting, it's a decidedly warm adventure. All ages. <i>(Nov.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Hiroo Onoda of the Japanese army made world headlines when he emerged from the Philippine jungle after a thirty-year ordeal. Hunted in turn by American troops, the Philippine army and police, hostile islanders, and eventually successive Japanese search parties, Onoda had skillfully outmaneuvered all his pursuers, convinced that World War II was still being fought and waiting for the day when his fellow soldiers would return victorious. This first-person account of those years of evading capture and trying to stay alive is filled with drama, tension, and excitement.<br><p>Readers learn about Onoda's early life, his training as an intelligence officer, and his final assignment to the Philippine island of Lubang. When American forces take over the island, he retreats into the mountains and life becomes a constant battle against the elements as well as the enemy. The description of his selfless dedication to a cause allows us a rare glimpse of the invincible spirit of the human being, and his ingenuity in adapting to primitive surroundings is a commentary on man's resourcefulness. Even after the Japanese forces surrender or are killed, courage and conviction allow him and his few comrades to continue until he alone returns to civilization. A soldier who fought and survived the war's longest, loneliest battle, Onoda became a hero to his people and his account of events, first published in Japan in 1974 and in English in 1975, has enjoyed an approving audience ever since. Currently no other English edition is in print.</p></p><p>Text: English, Japanese (translation)</p><h2>Blue Sky White Stars</h2><p><b>An inspiring and patriotic tribute to the beauty of the American flag, a symbol of America&#x2019;s history, landscape, and people, illustrated by <i>New York Times </i>bestselling and Caldecott-honor winning artist Kadir Nelson<br></b><br> Wonderfully spare, deceptively simple verses pair with richly evocative paintings to celebrate the iconic imagery of our nation, beginning with the American flag. Each spread, sumptuously illustrated by award-winning artist Kadir Nelson, depicts a stirring tableau, from the view of the Statue of Library at Ellis Island to civil rights marchers shoulder to shoulder, to a spacecraft at Cape Canaveral blasting off.&nbsp; This book is an ode to America then and now, from sea to shining sea.</p><p>Sarvinder Naberhaus is the author of <i>Boom Boom</i> and <i>Lines. Lines,&nbsp;</i>a *Starred Review book--follows the same profound yet simple text, similar to Blue Sky White Stars--STEM for the young.She was born in India and grew up in the heartland of America where she lives with her family.<br><br> Kadir Nelson is an acclaimed artist and the illustrator of several <i>New York Times</i> bestselling picture books, including his authorial debut <i>We Are the Ship: The Story of Negro League Baseball</i>, which won a Coretta Scott King Award and a Sibert Medal. Kadir has received three additional Coretta Scott King Awards and five Coretta Scott King honors. He has also received two Caldecott Honors, for <i>Henry's Freedom Box: A True Story from the Underground Railroad</i> and <i>Moses: When Harriet Tubman Led Her People to Freedom</i>, and has twice received the NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Literary Work.&gt;K-Gr 2&#x2014;Naberhaus, an Indian American immigrant, and Nelson, an African American illustrator, collaborate on this timely homage to the relationship among America's majesty, its hopefulness and diversity, and its flag. Beginning with iconic images of the country (rows of autumn-burnished trees, a white trail of wagons moving west under the blue sky), the spreads feature descriptive phrases paired with illustrations that depict all types of Americans who enjoy the freedoms that the flag represents. The phrase "sew together won nation" is accompanied by an image of a white colonial woman stitching a flag, while the facing page displays an image portraying diverse faces ("so together one nation"). A baseball stadium is captioned "all American" and is juxtaposed with an African American man and grandson listening to the game on the radio&#x2014;an American flag flying from their porch, a box of Cracker Jacks in hand, a cap emblazoned with "World War II veteran"; they are "all American," too. The raising of a flag and the launch of a rocket are paired with the phrase "rising up," followed by a determined eagle, the flag, and that same rocket "fly(ing) high." And when the rocket gets to the moon, the first thing planted there is a flag, which will be there "forever." History is written by the winners, and this title shows us that the symbols we value cross the barriers of race and ethnicity, making winners of us all. Naberhaus's short phrases are well chosen and evocative, but it is Nelson's paintings that bring power to this title&#x2014;even the back cover holds a special treat.

Through Zirin&#x2019;s eyes, sports are never mere games, but a reflection of&#x2014;and spur toward&#x2014;the political conflicts that shape American society.</p> <p>Half a century before Jackie Robinson was born, the black ballplayer Moses Fleetwood Walker brandished a revolver to keep racist fans at bay, then took his regular place in the lineup. In the midst of the Depression, when almost no black athletes were allowed on the U.S. Olympic team, athletes held a Counter Olympics where a third of the participants were African American.</p> <p> <i>A People&#x2019;s History of Sports in the United States</i> is replete with surprises for seasoned sports fans, while anyone interested in history will be amazed by the connections Zirin draws between politics and pop flies. As Jeff Chang, author of <i>Can&#x2019;t Stop Won&#x2019;t Stop</i>, puts it, &#x201c;After you read him, you&#x2019;ll never see sports the same way again.&#x201d;</p> <br></p><p>One of <i>UTNE Reader</i>&#x2019;s &#x201c;50 Visionaries Who Are Changing Our World,&#x201d; Dave Zirin is a columnist for <i>The Nation</i>, <i>SLAM Magazine</i>, and <i>The Progressive</i>.

There are many worthy and deserving stories of courage and conscience in this vast canvas; however, the telling suffers from Zirin's term paper-like prose that relies far too much on overly long quotes from source material. For example, three pages about NFL player Dave Meggyesy has a short introductory paragraph by Zirin and then excerpts Meggyesy's autobiography for the bulk of the section. This book would have been more engaging and logically organized as a reference book with entries on each athlete or group, rather than a linear historical narrative of sports.<br><br>Sportswriter Zirin (Welcome to the Terrordome: The Pain, Politics, and Promise of Sports, 2007, etc.) looks through the eyes of the left at the political forces shaping the history of American sports....<br><br>[...] The most satisfying sections of A People's History of Sports remind us of such brave moments, and of the courage of Paul Robeson, who was persecuted by the House Un-American Activities Committee, and of Jackie Robinson, who, at Branch Rickey's urging, initially repudiated and attacked Robeson, but then grew wiser regarding "America's destructiveness."

His scientist parents have been kidnapped after discovering a formula that enables mind control. Their work was so top secret Ozzy is afraid to go to the police, but without help, he fears he'll never find his parents. Then he stumbles across a classified ad in the local newspaper that says "Wizard for Hire. Call 555-SPEL." Ozzy has read about wizards in books like Harry Potter, but wizards couldn't actually exist today, could they? After Ozzy meets the wizard Labyrinth--aka Rin--he's even more skeptical.<br><br> Sure, Rin dresses like a wizard, but the short robe and high-top tennis shoes seem unorthodox, as does Rin's habit of writing notes on his shoes and eating breakfast for every meal. Plus, Rin doesn't even cast any magic spells, which means that the unexplained coincidences that start happening around Ozzy are just that--coincidences.<br><br> With the help of a robotic-talking raven invented by Ozzy's father, a kind and curious girl at school who decides to help Ozzy, and, of course, a self-proclaimed wizard who may or may not have a magical wand, Ozzy begins an unforgettable quest that will lead him closer to the answers he desperately seeks about his missing parents.</p><p>Obert Skye has traveled to all fifty states, visiting with children and librarians in hundreds of schools and inspiring people to read.

Years later, the 14-year-old has survived on his own, teaching himself from the collection of books and papers his parents left and eating from a well-stocked pantry of canned food. But after the discovery of a collection of tapes from his parents and a mechanical talking bird named Clark, Ozzy ventures out into the world to find his family and experience life outside the secluded cabin. He attends school, tries fast food, and buys new clothes for the first time before requesting the help of a breakfast-loving "wizard" named Rin. Ozzy's orphan story is a trope that many readers will have seen before, but his charisma and quick wits make his interaction with a world familiar to most readers&#x2014;school and restaurants especially,&#x2014;more interesting. Characters grow and change throughout, and dialogue is delightful, especially between Rin, the eccentric wizard who performs no magic, and Ozzy. While readers might expect resolutions via impressive magic, it's strokes of luck, quick thinking, or fast-talking that often save the day. VERDICT Winning characters and witty humor elevate the plot. A solid purchase for large collections where light magical fantasy circulates.&#x2014;Thomas Jonte, Pensacola State College, FL</p><h2>The Joyous Recovery: A New Approach to Emotional Healing and Wellness</h2><p>The Joyous Recovery is a path back to yourself. In this new guide to emotional recovery, Lundy Bancroft explains where healing comes from and why current approaches aren&#39;t bringing us the changes we&#39;re hoping for. You&#39;ll hear some surprising insights, including:* why fighting to improve your attitudes and outlook never works for long* why your healing is not all up to you, and why &#34;self-help&#34; so often fails* why you sometimes start to feel worse when your life starts to go better* why we&#39;re avoiding the paths to healing that actually work the best* why, even in our times, we still don&#39;t talk about the most important issuesAnalyzing our difficulties is much easier than finding our way to deep healing. So The Joyous Recovery spends just one chapter looking at what&#39;s gone wrong, and devotes the other nineteen to explaining what to do about it. Here&#39;s just a quick look at what you&#39;ll learn:* how to form an effective healing partnership, the game-changer for healing* how to understand the cyclical nature of successful healing, and how to get those cycles turning* how to understand your body&#39;s natural plan to keep you emotionally well -- you have an emotional immune system, not just a physical one -- and how to work with it to propel your recovery* how to harness the power of opposites, bringing parts of ourselves together that we thought had to be at war with each other* how to draw upon the exciting power of the Peak Living Network, a peer-led healing support system that costs nothing to participate in* how to make healing a joyful and transforming experience, instead of having it feel like lots of hard work for small gainsThe Joyous Recovery is an approach to emotional healing unlike anything you&#39;ve encountered before. And it works.Lundy Bancroft is the creator of the Peak Living Network. He has spe�cialized in abuse and recovery for the past 30 years, including over 10 years leading weekend healing retreats.

It is also ideally suited to serve as a supplemental text to more conventional textbooks that discuss each Gospel systematically. Most textbooks tend to introduce students to historical-critical concerns but may be less adequate for showing how the Gospel narratives, read as Scripture within the canonical framework of the entire New Testament and the whole Bible, yield material for theological reflection and moral edification.<br><br>Pennington neither dismisses nor duplicates the results of current historical-critical work on the Gospels as historical sources. Rather, he offers critically aware and hermeneutically intelligent instruction in reading the Gospels in order to hear their witness to Christ in a way that supports Christian application and proclamation.</p><p>"This is a book that could transform many people's reading of the Gospels. Jonathan Pennington has a wide knowledge of the specialist literature, and he skillfully distills what matters most for the task of reading the Gospels wisely. He is especially concerned that we read the Gospels in ways that are appropriate to the sort of texts they are. What comes across is a powerful sense that the Gospels are not only historical but also life changing."<br>--<b>Richard Bauckham</b>, University of St. Andrews; Ridley Hall, Cambridge<br> <br>"Reading the Gospels can be tricky, but it is important to read them with a full appreciation of their theology. Jonathan Pennington's study helps you get there--and get there well, as well as wisely."<br>--<b>Darrell Bock</b>, Dallas Theological Seminary<br><br>"Many books on the Gospels slog through source criticism, form criticism, and redaction criticism--important topics to be sure. How refreshing it is, however, to find a book with a new approach, one that reads the Gospels as literature and sees their importance theologically. This book is like a cool drink of water in what is too often the desert of Gospel studies. While I don't agree with everything Pennington says, his arguments must be reckoned with, and they further the conversation in productive and stimulating ways. I believe this is the best introductory book on the Gospels. Both students and professors will find it to be invaluable."<br>--<b>Thomas R. Schreiner</b>, Southern Baptist Theological Seminary<br><br>"Few academic enterprises of recent generations have been as chaotic and contradictory as the study of Jesus and the Gospels. Bultmann, Bornkamm, Borg, Burridge, Blomberg, Bauckham--and those are just some Bs--whom to believe? This learned yet lively volume attempts to transcend past miscues and cash in on lasting insights going back to patristic times. Pennington shows how the fourfold canonical Gospel ought to be read: as the proper entr�e to becoming Jesus's disciple for the sake of loving God by the work of the Spirit. Few works explain more."<br>--<b>Robert W. Yarbrough</b>, Covenant Theological Seminary, St. Louis, Missouri<b>Jonathan T.

It is a text on microbiology, and covers basic microbiology, medical microbiology, and some industrial microbiology. It is an unusual text because it offers the student an opportunity to learn by coloring illustrations in a planned and meaningful sequence. The coloring approach opens the subject of microorganisms to high school students, yet college and graduate students will also find the content of this text challenging. A great deal of information can be gained from studying and working properly designed illustrations. &#34;A picture is worth a thousand words.&#34; The student who colors the plates of this book will find real satisfaction in understanding the subject matter because it can be visualized. When recall of the material is required, the picture, complete with thoughtfully applied colors, quickly comes to mind. This book is a very important way to learn about a broad spectrum of microorganisms and how they interact with humans.

Rising amidst the beautiful wooded hills of Germany&#39;s Black Forest, it touches or winds its way through ten countries and four capital cities before emptying into the Black Sea through a vast delta whose silt filled channels spread across eastern Romania. From earliest times, the river has provided a route from Europe to Asia that was followed by armies and traders, while empires, from the Macedonian to the Habsburg, rose and fell along its length. Then, in the middle of the twentieth century, the Danube took on the role of a watery thread that unified a continent divided by the Iron Curtain. In the late 1980s the Iron Curtain lifted but the Danube valley soon became an arena for conflict during the violent break up of the former Yugoslavia. Now, passing as it does through some of the world&#39;s youngest nations, including Slovakia, Croatia, Serbia, Moldova, and Ukraine, the river is a tangible symbol of a new, peaceful, and united Europe as well as a vital artery for commercial and leisure shipping. Andrew Beattie explores the turbulent past and vibrant present of the landscape through which the Danube flows, where the enduring legacies of historical regimes from the Romans to the Nazis have all left their mark.</p><p><br><strong>Andrew Beattie </strong>is the author of <em>Cairo: A Cultural History a</em>nd <em>The Alps: A Cultural History.</em><br><br>"[T]the potpourri of geographical, historical, political, and economic facts about the Danubian lands will entertain and inform tourists exploring the region....Beattie...excels in providing accounts of the Danubian lands from his own experience....The book is replete with interesting fats and is an enjoyable read."--<em>Austrian History Yearbook</em><p></p><br></p><h2>How to Think Like an Anthropologist</h2><p><p><b>From an award-winning anthropologist, a lively, accessible, and irreverent introduction to the field</b></p><p>What is anthropology? What can it tell us about the world? Why, in short, does it matter? For well over a century, cultural anthropologists have circled the globe, from Papua New Guinea to California, uncovering surprising insights about how humans organize their lives and articulate their values. In the process, anthropology has done more than any other discipline to reveal what culture means and why it matters. By weaving together examples and theories from around the world, Matthew Engelke provides a lively, accessible, and at times irreverent introduction to anthropology, covering a wide range of classic and contemporary approaches, subjects, and anthropologists. Presenting memorable cases, he encourages readers to think deeply about key concepts that anthropologists use to make sense of the world. Along the way, he shows how anthropology helps us understand other cultures and points of view&#x2015;but also how, in doing so, it reveals something about ourselves and our own cultures, too.</p></p><p><p>Praise for the UK edition: "<i>How to Think Like an Anthropologist</i> is a terrific introduction to the field. Beautifully written, winningly told, and provocative, the book captures the basic feature of the discipline: that anthropology is a way of seeing and thinking. Anthropology invites you to see yourself as someone else might see you. In this way, it is the most world-changing of fields."<b>--T. H. Luhrmann, author of <i>When God Talks Back</i></b></p><p>Praise for the UK edition: "Playful and perceptive, Matthew Engelke welcomes readers into the fascinating history and profound insights of anthropology. This elegant synthesis shows how the discipline can change the way we think about the world."<b>--Caitlin Zaloom, author of <i>Out of the Pits: Traders and Technology from Chicago to London</i></b></p><p>Praise for the UK edition: "Accessible yet genuinely insightful, this is a lively, original, and inclusive introduction to anthropology both as a scholarly discipline and as a way of life. It combines superb storytelling and broad coverage--ranging from the classics to the author's own fieldwork experiences--and shows why anthropology really ought to be seen as the core of the social sciences: a discipline that trains one's brain to look deeply and empathetically into the lives of others."<b>--Charles King, Georgetown University</b></p><b>Matthew Engelke</b> is an anthropologist at Columbia University, where he directs the Institute for Religion, Culture, and Public Life.</p><h2>Four Major Plays: Doll&#39;s House; Ghosts; Hedda Gabler; and The Master Builder (Oxford World&#39;s Classics)</h2><p>Taken from the highly acclaimed Oxford Ibsen, this collection of Ibsen's plays includes<em> A Doll's House</em>, <em>Ghosts</em>, <em>Hedda Gabler</em>, and <em>The Master Builder</em>.<br><br><strong>About the Series: </strong>For over 100 years <strong>Oxford World's Classics</strong> has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe.

As devastating as any drug habit, it brings heartbreak and despair to those it entangles. But there is help for men and women caught in sexual addiction&#x2019;s downward spiral.This book offers a path that leads beyond compulsive thoughts and behaviors to healing and transformation. Sensitive to the shame of sexual addiction without minimizing its sinfulness, Dr. Mark Laaser traces the roots of the problem, discusses its patterns and impact, and maps out a biblical approach to self-control and sexual integrity.Previously titled Faithful and True, this revision includes an all-new section that deals with sexual addiction in the church. Other important changes reflect cultural trends, incorporate current research, and place a greater emphasis on spiritual growth. This book also addresses the unique needs and issues of female sex addicts. Whether you know someone with a sexual addiction or struggle yourself, Healing the Wounds of Sexual Addiction points the way to understanding, wholeness, and holiness.</p><p><p>Mark Laaser, MDiv, PhD,<strong> </strong>is the founder of Faithful &amp; True, a Christian-based counseling center in Minneapolis, specializing in sexual addiction. Dr. Laaser is regarded as the leading sexual addiction authority in the Christian counseling community. He is author of many books, including <em>Healing the Wounds of Sexual Addiction, Becoming a Man of Valor, Taking Every Thought Captive,</em> and <em>The 7 Principles of Highly Accountable Men.</em><em></em></p>Healing the Wounds of Sexual Addiction There Is Hope Once there was a young pastor who became a full-time individual, marriage, and family counselor. He, his wife, and three children lived in a nice, suburban neighborhood. The family had many friends and liked where they lived. In addition to counseling, this pastor was an interim preacher at a local church, taught a course at the local Christian college, and served on the school board. A popular communicator, he spoke for various groups and was frequently interviewed on radio and television. He also enjoyed volunteering at a hospice. All in all, this pastor was well liked and respected by his community, and many turned to him for support, advice, and encouragement. However, this pastor was also a sex addict. He had masturbated excessively since college. In graduate school he began visiting X-rated bookstores and massage parlors---a habit that continued into his professional career. Although he was afraid he would be caught and publicly humiliated, he could not stop practicing his sexual addictions. Needless to say, his marriage, which on the surface appeared loving and stable, was very troubled. He and his wife were so busy with family and careers they had little time for each other. Lacking skills in intimacy and believing his wife didn&#39;t really love him, the pastor thought himself justified in finding a woman who would. When several hurting and vulnerable women in his counseling practice looked to him for help, he initiated sex with them. He confused sex with love and believed he really cared for the women, never realizing how much he was hurting them. The pastor was tormented by self-doubt. He didn&#39;t like himself very much, and he wondered how these women could be attracted to someone like him. Time and time again he vowed to end the affairs, and time and time again he fell into sin. Eventually, a colleague found out about one of the affairs, and the pastor was fired from his counseling practice. Hurt and disappointed, the colleague and several others confronted the pastor. One, a doctor and recovering alcoholic, said to the pastor, &#39;Your behaviors with sex seem like mine with alcohol. You&#39;re out of control. Why don&#39;t you let us find you some help?&#39; The doctor hugged the pastor, for the doctor knew the pain of uncontrollable behaviors. Though shocked and afraid, the pastor was also tired of his double life---tired enough not to resist the efforts to find him help. Several days later he entered the sexual addiction unit at Golden Valley Health Center. In the months that followed, this pastor discovered the pain and joy of healing. It was a process filled with upsetting childhood memories, guilt for his behavior, and anguish over the abuse he perpetrated on others. His addiction had cost him a great deal. He would never counsel or preach from a pulpit again. Several of his clients sued him. Some looked at him and his behaviors with hatred and disdain. But the process was also filled with the joy of being honest, of a new life, and of restored relationships with his wife and friends. He began to discover the peace of healing and decided he wouldn&#39;t trade it for the world. Saved at the age of sixteen and ordained ten years before he found healing, this pastor always felt unworthy of God&#39;s forgiveness. Although he was admired by others, he felt they would hate him if they knew the truth. Only by embracing honesty and undertaking the transforming journey away from sexual addiction did he truly come to know God, redemption, and restoration. Sex addicts, like the pastor, commit a secret sin. It is so sinful that almost all are too ashamed to talk about it. Yet their sin, a profound violation of God&#39;s law, threatens our culture and the very core of the Christian church. The secret sin of sexual addiction grows from seeds planted in childhood and symptoms may go undetected for years. In adolescence, the indicators of this disease may be confused with normal sexual development. In adulthood, the disease grows progressively worse. Ultimately, if untreated, its victims will die. The secret sin is an addictive disease that has existed since the beginning of time, yet for centuries it has been misnamed, mistreated, ignored, or completely undiagnosed. Even though it has killed, humiliated, and wounded countless people, some still believe it doesn&#39;t exist. Those who suffer from sexual addiction have been laughed at, scorned, and persecuted. Too consumed by shame to ask for help, they have been confined to lives of loneliness and isolation. Only recently have we recognized the secret sin as a disease and offered treatment to its sufferers. Christians are not exempt from this disease. Experts speculate up to 10 percent of the total Christian population in the United States is sexually addicted. If true, this means that in a congregation of 500 members, 50 are sex addicts. And this percentage may be increasing. In one study, two-thirds of all Christian men admitted to &#39;struggling&#39; with pornography. In another study, 40 percent of pastors surveyed confessed to looking at pornography. Although these findings do not indicate the respondents are fully addicted, it is tragic that the percentages of those interacting with pornography are far higher now than just a few years ago. This is due in large part to the availability of pornography on the Internet. Christians who struggle pray ceaselessly, read the Bible constantly, and consult countless pastors, but they still can&#39;t stop. Discouraged, many leave the church. Sexual sin is not new news to the church. Voices among us have consistently protested this immorality and called for repentance. Yet sexual sin remains a difficult topic to talk about. When &#39;one of us&#39; commits a sexual sin, the rest of us are shocked and embarrassed by the apparent hypocrisy and massive failure of faith. In response, we turn inward to our own shame, fears, and confusion, and try to keep the situation as quiet as possible. It is time to bring the problem of sexual sin into the arena of public discourse within the Christian community. The church can no longer ignore sexual addiction or pretend it exists only &#39;out there,&#39; for it plagues both our families and our congregations.

Today this rate has risen to nearly one in two men and one in three women (see Table 1). This year more than 559,000 Americans will die of cancer, and another 1,445,000 new cases will be detected. After decades of increasing mortality rates, the number of deaths from cancer has declined slightly for the first time, reflecting changes in dietary practice, less smoking, and better medical treatment. Altogether, more than 100 million Americans now living will eventually get the disease. Along with cardiovascular disease and medical error, cancer is one of the three major causes of death in modern society.</p><p>While the mortality rate from some cancers&#x2014;for example, stomach, cervix, and rectum&#x2014;has declined in the United States, it has steeply risen for others, notably lung, melanoma, prostate, multiple myloma, and brain tumors (see Table 2).</p><p>Despite ever more sophisticated methods of diagnosis and treatment, the consensus is that the War on Cancer declared in 1971 is being lost. &#x201c;My overall assessment is that the national cancer program must be judged a qualified failure,&#x201c; Dr. John Bailer, who served on the staff of the National Cancer Institute for twenty years and was editor of the New En gland Journal of Medicine, contends. &#x201c;The five-year survival statistics of the American Cancer Society are very misleading. They now count things that are not cancer, and, because we are able to diagnose at an earlier stage of the disease, patients falsely appear to live longer. Our whole cancer research in the past twenty years has been a total failure. More people over thirty are dying from cancer than ever before... More women with mild or benign diseases are being included in statistics and reported as being &#x2018;cured.&#x2019; When government officials point to survival figures and say they are winning the war against cancer they are using those survival rates improperly.&#x201d;</p><p>The United States is not unique in losing the battle against cancer. Infact, among the nations of the world, it ranks in the middle. Twenty-three of the fifty countries recently surveyed had higher mortality rates than the United States for cancer among men, and sixteen had higher rates among women. Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and Luxembourg had the highest death rates for men, while Denmark, Scotland, and Hungary had the highest for women.</p><p>Clearly, cancer is one of the great levelers of the modern age. It strikes high and low, rich and poor, male and female, young and old, black and white, Westerner and Easterner, Democrat and Republican, Muslim and Jew, saint and sinner. There is hardly a family today untouched.</p><p>Despite the optimistic reports of the National Cancer Institute and American Cancer Society, the nation has yet to develop a solid campaign of primary prevention. The focus remains on diagnosis and screening (which are often harmful and cancer-causing in themselves) and on treatment with drugs, surgery, and radiation, which have also been implicated in increasing the risk of the disease.</p><p>According to the International Agency for Research in Cancer, &#x201c;Eighty to 90 percent of human cancer is determined environmentally and thus theoretically avoidable. These include the modern diet high in animal products and low in whole grains, fresh fruits, and vegetables; excessive exposure to sunlight, workplace hazards, pollution, toxic products; artificial electromagnetic radiation; and exposure to medical procedures and pharmaceuticals.&#x201d; &#x201c;Despite the general recognition that 85 percent of all cancers is caused by environmental influences,&#x201c; Hans Ruesch, a medical historian, notes, &#x201c;less than 10 percent of the National Cancer Institute bud get is given to environmental causes. And despite the recognition that the majority of environmental causes are linked to nutrition, less than 1 percent of the NCI bud get is devoted to nutrition studies.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;In our culture, treating disease is enormously profitable,&#x201c; Dr. Robert Sharpe points out. The market in cancer therapies in the United States, Europe, and Japan makes tens of billions of dollars profit annually and is growing at over 10 percent each year. &#x201c;Preventing the disease benefits no one except the patient. Just as the drug industry thrives on the &#x2018;pill for every ill&#x2019; mentality, so many of the leading medical charities are financially sustained by the dream of a miracle cure, just around the corner.&#x201d;</p><p>OTHER HEALTH TRENDS</p><p>Other chronic and degenerative illnesses are also on the rise. In the last twenty-five years, AIDS has spread around the world, affecting tens of millions of people. Though primarily an immune-deficiency disorder, AIDS is related to cancer, and many AIDS patients come down with Kaposi&#x2019;s sarcoma (a form of skin cancer), lymphoma, and other malignancies.</p><p>One of the most dramatic increases in recent decades has been in the area of sexual disorders. According to the British Medical Association, the number of new cases of venereal disease has risen 1,700 percent since 1957. In the United States, syphilis rose one-third between 2007 and 2008. Around the world, herpes and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) have assumed epidemic proportions. This year it was widely reported in the United States that one in four teenage girls had an STD. Infertility is also on the rise. Over the last sixty-five years, average sperm counts in American males have dropped dramatically. An analysis of data collected from 1938 to 1990 by the National Institutes of Health indicates that sperm densities in the United States have exhibited an average annual decrease of 1.5 million sperm per milliliter of collected sample, or about 1.5 percent per year. Those in European countries have declined at about twice that rate (3.1 percent per year). Another study of otherwise healthy college males showed that 23 percent were functionally sterile. The number of cesarean sections has doubled in the last ten years, accounting for 30 percent of all births. The risk of death for C-sections is also about four times higher than for vaginal births even if there is no medical emergency. Women are also about three times as liable to suffer severe complications or experience difficulties during subsequent births.</p><p>Moreover, more than 550,000 American women, many of childbearing age, currently have their ovaries or uteruses surgically removed each year, primarily because of cancer or the fear of cancer. Many of these are prophylactic operations in completely healthy women who have been told that their risk of developing cancer will be reduced. By age sixty-five, a majority of American women have lost their wombs. Similar trends are now spreading worldwide. According to many medical experts, more than 90 percent of hysterectomies are unnecessary, and about 40 percent of the time, the ovaries are also needlessly removed during this procedure.</p><p>In the last few years, obesity has been declared the world&#x2019;s number one health problem by the World Health Organization. It is an underlying condition not only for heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and many other ills, but also for many cancers, including breast cancer, colon cancer, and cancer of the esophagus, thyroid, kidney, uterus, and gall bladder. In the United States, about two out of three adults are overweight or obese, and one of every three children falls into one of these brackets.</p><p>A host of new diseases has developed to challenge medical science and global health. Avian flu, SARS, and other acute respiratory diseases have killed hundreds of people, threatening to turn into worldwide pandemics. Meanwhile, old illnesses are coming back in more virulent form. New varieties of multiple-drug resistant pneumonia and staph and other common infections have been reported for which there is no medical relief available. Overprescription of antibiotics, antivirals, and other pharmaceuticals has enabled new, more deadly strains of microbes to evolve. Malaria, once believed to have been eradicated by modern medicine, has also proved invulnerable to many drugs and is spreading, with 2.7 million deaths annually. Tuberculosis, also once believed to have been conquered by new wonder drugs after World War II, has returned in new, virulent forms and causes an estimated 521,000 deaths globally each year.</p><p>Even the common cold, despite a much publicized medical campaign begun under President John F. Kennedy, remains largely immune to effective treatment. In fact, few major sicknesses, if any, can really be cured by modern methods. In some cases pain and other discomfort can be relieved and the symptoms temporarily diminished or controlled, but, fundamentally, illness cannot be cured. Prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, and a host of treatments and procedures, including surgery and radiation, offer at best temporarily relief and, at worst, push the imbalance deeper into the body where it manifests in more serious form later.</p><p>Altogether, disease accounts for about 80 percent of all deaths worldwide. The rest are caused primarily by accident&#x2014;often resulting from physical or mental decline&#x2014;and social violence, including war, crime, and abuse and neglect of children, spouses, and the elderly. In the United States, more people have died in recent decades from homicide than have died on the battlefronts of foreign wars. Violence and terrorism are also on the rise in other parts of the world.</p><p>Like the human family, the planet as a whole is in urgent need of healing. The natural environment is being destroyed by the unchecked spread&#x2014;metastases&#x2014;of technology, development, and urbanization. Tropical rain forests and millions of species of plants and animals are vanishing. Desertification is spreading as topsoil becomes depleted and crops will no longer grow in soil saturated with harmful chemicals. The world&#x2019;s nonrenewable resources are rapid...</p></p><h2>Wholeheartedness: Busyness, Exhaustion, and Healing the Divided Self</h2><p><i>I&#x2019;m being pulled in a thousand different directions.</i><br> &nbsp;<br> As a therapist, Chuck DeGroat hears that line all the time. &#x201c;I hear it from students and software developers,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;I hear it from spiritual leaders and coffee baristas.

Rather than organizing plants, including trees, shrubs, and herbaceous plants, by flower color or family characteristics, as is done in most guidebooks, botanist Tim Spira takes a holistic, ecological approach that enables the reader to identify and learn about plants in their natural communities. This approach, says Spira, better reflects the natural world, as plants, like other organisms, don't live in isolation; they coexist and interact in myriad ways. <br><br>Full-color photo keys allow the reader to rapidly preview plants found within each of the 21 major plant communities described, and the illustrated species description for each of the 340 featured plants includes fascinating information about the ecology and natural history of each plant in its larger environment. With this new format, readers can see how the mountain and piedmont landscapes form a mosaic of plant communities that harbor particular groups of plants. The volume also includes a glossary, illustrations of plant structures, and descriptions of sites to visit.

Once places of refuge, the laundries have evolved into grim workhouses. Some inmates are &#x201c;fallen&#x201d; women&#x2014;unwed mothers, prostitutes, or petty criminals. Most are ordinary girls whose only sin lies in being too pretty, too independent, or tempting the wrong man. Among them is sixteen-year-old Teagan Tiernan, sent by her family when her beauty provokes a lustful revelation from a young priest.<br><br>Teagan soon befriends Nora Craven, a new arrival who thought nothing could be worse than living in a squalid tenement flat. Stripped of their freedom and dignity, the girls are given new names and denied contact with the outside world. The Mother Superior, Sister Anne, who has secrets of her own, inflicts cruel, dehumanizing punishments&#x2014;but always in the name of love. Finally, Nora and Teagan find an ally in the reclusive Lea, who helps them endure&#x2014;and plot an escape. But as they will discover, the outside world has dangers too, especially for young women with soiled reputations.<br><br>Told with candor, compassion, and vivid historical detail, <i>The Magdalen Girls</i> is a masterfully written novel of life within the era&#x2019;s notorious institutions&#x2014;and an inspiring story of friendship, hope, and unyielding courage.</p><p><b>V.S. Alexander</b> is an ardent student of history with a strong interest in music and the visual arts. Some of V.S.&#x2019;s writing influences include Shirley Jackson, Oscar Wilde, Daphne du Maurier, or any work by the exquisite Bront� sisters. V.S. lives in Florida and is at work on a second historical novel for Kensington.<b>Praise for THE MAGDALEN GIRLS by V.S. Alexander</b><br><br>&#x201c;Filled with authentic details . . . Alexander methodically builds the details of the dreary and demanding existence that has become daily life for these girls who had dreams and ambitions like other 16-year-olds. As the girls' friendship progresses and their desperation to escape grows, the story quickens, racing toward an ending that is both incredibly sad and hopeful. Because the novel is historically accurate (the last Magdalen laundry closed in 1996), the events depicted are particularly distressing, forcing readers to be engrossed and horrified by what the Catholic Church and other secular and religious entities did to rehabilitate "fallen" women, who needed the grace of God to be saved from their sinful lives, no matter how true or untrue.&#x201d; &#x2014;ShelfAwareness<br><br>&#x201c;Showcasing hard-won victories and a terrible tragedy, this novel shines a light on a dark period in twentieth-century Ireland. Alexander has done his homework, peppering his novel with details of the convent lifestyle and the shameful treatment of the Magdalen laundry girls.

The book helps parents, teachers, and other adults in middle school settings to understand the social dilemmas and other issues that kids today face. Author Michelle Icard covers a large range of topics, beginning with helping us understand what is happening in the brains of tweens and how these neurological development affects decision-making and questions around identity. She also addresses social media, dating, and peer exclusion. Using both recent research and her personal, extensive experience working with middle-school-aged kids and their parents, Icard offers readers concrete and practical advice for guiding children through this chaotic developmental stage while also building their confidence.</p><p>In 2004, Michelle Icard launched Athena&#x2019;s Path, a curriculum that helps girls navigate the tricky middle school social scene. Shortly after, she added Hero&#x2019;s Pursuit for boys, and in 2011 launched her website about how to parent middle school children: MichelleintheMiddle.com.<br> Athena&#x2019;s Path and Hero&#x2019;s Pursuit have been implemented in thirty schools, in five states, and have impacted over 10,000 students. More than 250 teachers have been trained to implement the programs in schools. Michelle is often a guest speaker at schools and parenting events, and she hosts Right in the Middle, a conference for girls headed to middle school and their moms. Michelle also runs Moms Meet Up, a parent conversation and support group for parents of middle schoolers. She provides private coaching for parents and teens.<br> Michelle has written curriculum for other national programs for adolescents, including Girlology and Girls Rock the House. In addition to her own blog, Michelle writes for <i>Your Teen Magazine</i>, The Karina Chronicles blog, and Charlotte Smarty Pants.<br> She is the mother of a 13-year-old daughter and an 11-year-old son.<br> Icard, the creator of the middle school social skills courses Athena&#x2019;s Path and Hero&#x2019;s Pursuit, shares affirming, spot-on advice for guiding kids through the difficult middle school years, blending thoughtful practicality, and gentle humor. Icard recommends that parents serve as the calm assistant manager&#x2019; to their children&#x2019;s growing brain, guiding them toward slower thinking and problem solving, and acting as empathetic coach rather than micromanager; she offers sample conversations to demonstrate what that might look like. Icard supports giving children greater independence, letting them take risks, and (monitored) use of social media, among many other helpful tips. Most importantly, Icard successfully positions herself as a knowledgeable, sympathetic peer someone who knows that parents want to have a great relationship with their children during this period of rapid change.&#x201d; <b><i>Publishers Weekly</i></b><br><br> <i>Middle School Makeover</i> is a great resource for anyone with a current or soon-to-be middle schooler in their life. With the voice of a friend, plenty of humor and lots of practical tips, Michelle Icard provides insight and answers to tween behaviors. Middle School Makeover also equips adults with useful to do&#x2019; and to don&#x2019;t&#x2019; tips for helping their middle schooler gain independence and confidence.&#x201d; <b>Melisa Holmes,</b> MD; founder, Girlology; author of <i>Girlology: A Girl&#x2019;s Guide to Growing Up</i><br> Written with humor, empathy, and remarkable insight, <i>Middle School Makeover</i> feels less like a book and more like a conversation with friends over coffee. Parent-to-parent, Michelle Icard translates cutting-edge developmental research and professional terminology into plain language and practical advice for managing the many twists and turns of early adolescence. Most importantly, the book transforms the image of middle school as dreadful for kids and dreaded by parents into a stage of life that is unique, exciting, and full of potential. You will not look at your child, or perhaps even recall your own middle school years, in the same way again!&#x201d; <b>Beth A. Kotchick,</b> PhD, associate professor, Loyola University, Maryland<br><br> Was middle school bad enough when you were going through it? Is facing middle school again through your child&#x2019;s experience giving you pause and anxiety? Worry no more. Michelle Icard has done an incredible job of offering parents not just the empathy they seek but the strategies they need to navigate their child&#x2019;s middle school year with wisdom, grace, and foresight. Icard so deftly blends storytelling, research, and guidance, you&#x2019;ll feel like you are having lunch with that smart, compassionate friend who never lets you feel defeated. <i>Middle School Makeover</i> will empower you to capably and calmly parent through the hard times and inspire you to celebrate through them, too.&#x201d; <b>Rosie Molinary,</b> author of <i>Beautiful You: A Daily Guide to Radical Self-Acceptance</i><br><br> A makeover is desperately needed indeed. In twenty-five years of working with teenagers and their families, I&#x2019;ve only had two people ask to volunteer to work with middle schoolers. In that same time, the stress that embraces parents is exactly what Michelle has described. <i>Middle School Makeover</i> is a book I will insist the families with whom I work and the students I teach have at their fingertips.&#x201d; <b>Brian Foreman,</b> EdD, youth ministry consultant and author of <i>#Connect: Reaching Youth Across the Digital Divide</i> and <i>How to Be #SocialMedia Parents.</i><br><br> <i>Middle School Makeover</i> is a masterpiece of how-tos for any parent dealing with the challenges of the middle school years. Parenting a middle schooler can be one of the most difficult times for parents to navigate. Michelle guides parents, using concrete solutions to reallife problems, faced by kids in their teen years. Michelle&#x2019;s practical advice and humorous writing style make for an easy read for busy parents on-the-go.&#x201d; <b>Seanna Crosbie,</b> LCSW clinical therapist and director, Child Guidance Center, Texas<br><br> Every middle school parent, teacher, and child would benefit greatly from this makeover. With clear writing, warmth, and humor, Icard offers straightforward paths through some of the bumpier aspects of the dark, scary place known as Middle School. She weaves personal anecdotes together with research and expert insights to give parents and educators all the tools they will need to navigate this phase with their child. By addressing not just the needs of the middle schooler but the middle school parent as well, she reveals herself to be the perfect ally during this sometimes tumultuous phase. But Icard&#x2019;s greatest gift and the book&#x2019;s primary accomplishment is how it subtly shifts our expectations of middle school. By the end, every reader will feel that this is not a phase to be feared, but celebrated and enjoyed. We highly recommend to anyone who lives or works with middle schoolers.&#x201d; <b>Erin Dymowski and Ellen Williams,</b> Sisterhood of the Sensible Moms<br><br> <i>Middle School Makeover</i> is a must read for anyone who has or works with middle students. Michelle brings understanding, compassion and wisdom to caring for this much misunderstood group of young people. I encourage every middle school parent to pick up this book, your middle schooler will be so glad you did!&#x201d; <b>Vicki Abadesco,</b> co-founder, Soul Shoppe author of <i>Free to Be: Creating a Safe, Fun &amp; Bully-Free World</i><br><br> Michelle&#x2019;s book is a terrific blend of solid research, innovative ideas, and good old-fashioned experience with adolescents. There are a lot of books full of buzz words and generic advice, but Michelle&#x2019;s book drills down into specifics: what to say, how to say it, how not to say it, and the facial expression to show while saying it. The book hits on many of those tough social situations that leave adults struggling for words when it comes to advising their children. In my job as a school counselor, I reach for her material when trying to guide a middle school student (or parent of a middle-schooler) through a very trying and very real situation.&#x201d; <b>Wes Calbreath,</b> MED Middle School Counselor at Charlotte-Mecklenburg School System</p><h2>Julius Caesar (Revised Edition) (A Wicked History)</h2><p><b>Julius Caesar rose from chaos to bring order to Rome.</b><br><br>The wicked ways of some of the most ruthless rulers to walk the earth are revealed in these thrilling biographies (A Wicked History) about men and women so monstrous, they make Frankenstein look like a sweetheart. <br><br>After gaining power, he attacked his allies and won a brutal civil war.

The intention of \atoms-first involves a few basic principles: first, it introduces atomic and molecular structure much earlier than the traditional approach, and it threads these themes through subsequent chapters. This approach may be chosen as a way to delay the introduction of material such as stoichiometry that students traditionally find abstract and difficult, thereby allowing students time to acclimate their study skills to chemistry. Additionally, it gives students a basis for understanding the application of quantitative principles to the chemistry that underlies the entire course. It also aims to center the study of chemistry on the atomic foundation that many will expand upon in a later course covering organic chemistry, easing that transition when the time arrives. The second edition has been revised to incorporate clearer, more current, and more dynamic explanations, while maintaining the same organization as the first edition. Substantial improvements have been made in the figures, illustrations, and example exercises that support the text narrative.<br><br>PLEASE NOTE: COVER MAY VARY.

The story of a daring Nazi commando raid into a small English village in 1943 has some surprising consequences. The prelude to the actual landing is staged in German and English scenes, perfectly suited to radio-style dramatization. Nazi generals with thick accents, an undercover IRA assassin using a lilting brogue and a German agent in the guise of the perfect English country woman offer excellent roles for the talented cast. The use of sound effects is good, and the production offers suspense to the last moments. R.F.W.

The CCSS relates Scripture to Christian life today, is faithfully Catholic, and is supplemented by features designed to help readers understand the Bible more deeply and use it more effectively in teaching, preaching, evangelization, and other forms of ministry. Supported by leading Catholic scholars as well as popular Bible teachers, the series offers a unique level of commentary for Catholic students of the Bible. Its attractive packaging and accessible writing style make it a series to own--and to read! Drawn from the best of contemporary scholarship, series volumes are keyed to the liturgical year and include an index of pastoral subjects.</p><p>"Scott Hahn has written a masterful commentary on Romans that is theologically insightful and pastorally relevant. While dealing adeptly with the historical and literary background of Romans, he always keeps the focus on its theological content and meaning for our lives.

Matera</b>, Catholic University of America<br><br>"Hahn's commentary on Romans is lucid, penetrating, theologically alert, and a joy to read. It will be of interest to both scholar and nonscholar alike. His status as one of the most prominent Catholic converts from Protestantism makes his treatment of this great Pauline text, which was of such significance to Luther and the other Reformers, of particular interest."<br>--<b>Robert Barron</b>, Auxiliary Bishop of Los Angeles<br><br>"Hahn has written an informative, elegant, and learned commentary on Romans. The exegesis is crisp, the explanations are clear, and the judgments are consistently sensible. One of the best commentaries available on Romans from within the Catholic tradition.

Bird</b>, Ridley College, Melbourne, Australia<br><br>"For four decades, Hahn has joyfully studied, debated, preached, taught, and lived Paul's Letter to the Romans. No biblical book is closer to his heart, with the result that the vibrant wisdom of this commentary exceeds that of commentaries many times its size. Judicious in its sifting of the scholarly literature, profound in its handling of sensitive Jewish-Christian themes, and powerful in its proclamation of the gospel, this deeply Catholic commentary will find a notable place among his most enduring and influential books."<br>--<b>Matthew Levering</b>, Mundelein Seminary<br><br>For more information on the series, visit <b>www.CatholicScriptureCommentary.com</b><b>Scott&nbsp;W.

The combustion engine which is destroying our planet&#x2019;s atmosphere and rapidly making it inhospitable is working exactly as we designed it. Guns, which lead to so much death, work exactly as they&#x2019;re designed to work. And every time we &#x201c;improve&#x201d; their design, they get better at killing. Facebook&#x2019;s privacy settings, which have outed gay teens to their conservative parents, are working exactly as designed. Their &#x201c;real names&#x201d; initiative, which makes it easier for stalkers to re-find their victims, is working exactly as designed. Twitter&#x2019;s toxicity and lack of civil discourse is working exactly as it&#x2019;s designed to work.The world is working exactly as designed. And it&#x2019;s not working very well. Which means we need to do a better job of designing it. Design is a craft with an amazing amount of power. The power to choose. The power to influence. As designers, we need to see ourselves as gatekeepers of what we are bringing into the world, and what we choose not to bring into the world. Design is a craft with responsibility. The responsibility to help create a better world for all. Design is also a craft with a lot of blood on its hands. Every cigarette ad is on us. Every gun is on us. Every ballot that a voter cannot understand is on us. Every time social network&#x2019;s interface allows a stalker to find their victim, that&#x2019;s on us. The monsters we unleash into the world will carry your name. This book will make you see that design is a political act. What we choose to design is a political act. Who we choose to work for is a political act. Who we choose to work with is a political act. And, most importantly, the people we&#x2019;ve excluded from these decisions is the biggest (and stupidest) political act we&#x2019;ve made as a society.If you&#x2019;re a designer, this book might make you angry. It should make you angry. But it will also give you the tools you need to make better decisions. You will learn how to evaluate the potential benefits and harm of what you&#x2019;re working on. You&#x2019;ll learn how to present your concerns. You&#x2019;ll learn the importance of building and working with diverse teams who can approach problems from multiple points-of-view. You&#x2019;ll learn how to make a case using data and good storytelling. You&#x2019;ll learn to say NO in a way that&#x2019;ll make people listen. But mostly, this book will fill you with the confidence to do the job the way you always wanted to be able to do it. This book will help you understand your responsibilities.</p><p></p><h2>The Unabridged Devil&#39;s Dictionary</h2><p><p>If we could only put aside our civil pose and say what we really thought, the world would be a lot like the one alluded to in <i>The Unabridged Devil&#x2019;s Dictionary</i>.

These citadels, well hidden from mankind, are occupied by groups of Satanists who are chanting the world to ruin. Perhaps this is just a story; perhaps there is some truth behind it. But what if there is yet another tower, a tower not of good or evil but of infinite power? What if all our destinies are controlled by this cosmic force for its own mysterious purposes? And what if UFOs and other paranormal manifestations are merely tools being used to manipulate us and guide us toward the cosmic role we are fated to play? Perhaps, after all, we are not independent beings but are instead the creations and slaves of the eighth tower.</p></p><p></p><h2>The Artist&#39;s Way Every Day: A Year of Creative Living</h2><p><b>This new book from the author of the international bestseller <i>The Artist&#x2019;s Way</i> guides readers through a year of cultivating a deeper connection to their creative selves.</b><br><br> <i>The Artist&#x2019;s Way</i> has touched the lives of millions of people around the world.

If you have always wanted to pursue a creative dream, have always wanted to play and create with words or paints, this book will gently get you started and help you learn all kinds of paying-attention techniques; and that, after all, is what being an artist is all about.

This masterful account of the country&#x2019;s exceptional cultural heritage sheds light on how Japan has nurtured distinctive aesthetics, prominent artists, and movements that have achieved global influence and popularity.<br><br>A leading authority on Japanese art history, Tsuji Nobuo discusses works ranging from the J&#x14d;mon period to contemporary art, from earthenware figurines in 13,000 BCE to manga, anime, and modern subcultures. He explains crucial aspects of Japan&#x2019;s many artistic mediums and styles&#x2015;including paintings, <i>ukiyo-e</i>, ceramics, sculpture, armor, gardens, and architecture&#x2015;covering thousands of years. Drawing on newly discovered archaeological findings and the latest research, the book examines Japanese art in various contexts, including Buddhist and religious influences, aristocratic and popular aesthetics, and interactions with the world. Generously illustrated with hundreds of full-color images, maps, and figures, <i>History of Art in Japan</i> is an indispensable resource for all those interested in this multifaceted history, illuminating countless aspects of Japanese art for scholars and general readers alike.</p><p>Tsuji Nobuo is professor emeritus at the University of Tokyo and Tama Art University and former director of Chiba City Museum and the Miho Museum.

(John T. Carpenter, Mary Griggs Burke Curator of Japanese Art, Metropolitan Museum of Art)<br><br>The appearance of Professor Tsuji Nobuo&#x2019;s history of Japanese art in an English edition is a watershed moment both for the field and for the discipline of art history as a whole. The most important Japanese art historian of his generation, Tsuji weaves a narrative covering millennia of art in the archipelago by intertwining themes and concepts he has long championed, such as the roles of the decorative, playfulness, and eccentricity, all of which serve to liberate the arts of Japan from standard tropes of style, form, and iconography that have dominated western art historical discourse. Balanced, extensive attention devoted both to the prehistoric J&#x14d;mon, Yayoi, and Kofun periods as well as to the modern era take his book far beyond the parameters of previous survey texts, and highlights the dynamism, imagination, and visual spectacle of Japanese art. In this beautifully illustrated volume Professor Tsuji brings home the point that from wooden Buddhist sculptures to &#x201c;Superflat,&#x201d; it is in the startling visual impact of Japanese art that its greatest pleasures can be discovered. (Matthew McKelway, Columbia University)<br><br>Tsuji has earned recognition for combining authority and accuracy with interesting and imaginative insights. In every chapter, <i>History of Art in Japan</i> provides a thorough and engaging account of individual works in their social context while maintaining an international frame of reference. It is an immense gift to readers of all levels.

We strain to be more efficient, to cram more into each minute, each hour, each day. Since the Industrial Revolution shifted the world into high gear, the cult of speed has pushed us to a breaking point. Consider these facts: Americans on average spend seventy-two minutes of every day behind the wheel of a car, a typical business executive now loses sixty-eight hours a year to being put on hold, and American adults currently devote on average a mere half hour per week to making love. </p> <p> Living on the edge of exhaustion, we are constantly reminded by our bodies and minds that the pace of life is spinning out of control. <i>In Praise of Slowness</i> traces the history of our increasingly breathless relationship with time and tackles the consequences of living in this accelerated culture of our own creation. Why are we always in such a rush? What is the cure for time sickness? Is it possible, or even desirable, to slow down? Realizing the price we pay for unrelenting speed, people all over the world are reclaiming their time and slowing down the pace - and living happier, healthier, and more productive lives as a result. A Slow revolution is taking place. </p> <p> Here you will find no Luddite calls to overthrow technology and seek a preindustrial utopia. This is a modern revolution, championed by cell-phone using, e-mailing lovers of sanity. The Slow philosophy can be summed up in a single word - balance. People are discovering energy and efficiency where they may have been least expected - in slowing down. </p> <p> In this engaging and entertaining exploration, award-winning journalist and rehabilitated speedaholic Carl Honor� details our perennial love affair with efficiency and speed in a perfect blend of anecdotal reportage, history, and intellectual inquiry.</p></p><p>In the tradition of such trailblazing books as No Logo and The Tipping Point, In Praise of Slow heralds a growing international movement of people dedicated to slowing down the pace of our contemporary times and enjoying a richer, fuller life as a result. <br>These days, almost everyone complains about the hectic pace of their lives. We live in a world where speed rules and everyone is under pressure to go faster. But when speed is king, anyone or anything that gets in our way, that slows us down, becomes an enemy. Thanks to speed, we are living in the age of rage. <br>Carl Honore has discovered a movement that is quickly working its way into the mainstream. Groups of people are developing a recipe for living better in a fast-paced, modern environment by striving for a new balance between fast and slow. In an entertaining and hands-on investigation of this new movement, Honore takes us from a Tantric sex workshop in a trendy neighbourhood in London, England to Bra, Italy, the home of the Slow Food, Slow Cities and Slow Sex movements. He examines how we can continue to live productive lives by embracing the tenets of the slow movement. <br>A challenging take on the cult of speed, as well as a corrective look at how we can approach our lives with new understanding, In Praise of Slow uncovers a movement whose time has come.<p>Carl Honore is an award-winning journalist and author whose revolutionary first book, <em>In Praise of Slowness</em>, was an international bestseller and has been published in more than thirty languages.

For those who have always wanted to or tried and failed to learn to draw it provides simple step-by-step instruction, plus easy-to-follow practice exercises, and provides the motivation and inspiration readers need to be successful. For those who already draw, <i>Everyday Sketching and Drawing</i> offers another technique to add to their drawing arsenal.</b><br><br>Why do so many adults come to view drawing as difficult or fraught with anxiety? Traditional art instruction is often bogged down with jargon, rules, and admonishments that unintentionally stifle the joy of drawing for its own sake.<br><br>Steven Reddy's new and easy approach to drawing instructs sketchers to document their unique and compelling lives in realistic yet playful sketches that record the places, spaces, and objects that help define them as individuals. He reminds artists to slow down, notice, and attend to the sketch-worthy scenes and subjects that are unstaged and always there in our everyday lives. He offers a versatile technique that can lead to a skill that fills sketchbooks with the visual details that differentiate one life from another. This approach is a meditative, relaxing alternative to academic concerns about perspective, proportion, and accuracy. Reddy encourages artists to capture in whimsical but detail-specific illustrations their unique, subjective interpretation of their visual surroundings.<br><br>Steven Reddy's drawing method produces extremely detailed and realistic scenes of objects and scenes in everyday life in a relatively short period of time (60 minutes to 3 hours or more, depending on the sketcher's preference). Modifying a technique utilized by Old Master oil painters, the drawings pass through 5 clearly articulated stages where each step focuses on one visual concept at a time.</p><p><b>Steven B.

The art materials don't matter because art is all about relationships and harmony, which can be achieved with any paints. What matters is how you use the materials.&#x201d; </i><br> &#x2014;Aleksander Titovets<br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> A lot can be written about tools and materials and still only scratch the surface of your options. A visit to any art supply store can quickly become overwhelming. Just when you get accustomed to a sketchbook or brand of ink, manufacturers discontinue your favorite products and art supply stores change their inventory. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> I sketch with friends who build custom, portable travel kits out of Altoid tins and film canisters. They &#x201c;MacGyver&#x201d; ingenious devices for holding inks and watercolors to the edge of sketchbooks as they draw. They chat about technical pens, brands of watercolor, and the advantages of different weights of paper. They create complex charts comparing watercolor brands and build detailed graphs of pens and inks.<br> &nbsp;<br> My own materials haven&#x2019;t changed much over the years, evolving only gradually on a need-to-grow basis. I&#x2019;m less interested in tools than in helpful ways of seeing. The artistic principles and elements I mull over while drawing would be the same if I were scratching contour lines in sand with a stick: focus on the scene with the goal of understanding the objects and their relationships and translate them into drawings, whatever the tools. I want my drawings to say, &#x201c;Look at this. We pass by or handle these objects every day until they become invisible and taken for granted. But look how interesting they are!&#x201d;<br><br><b>What&#x2019;s in My Bag</b><br> It helps to keep your materials simple and compact. My preferred instruments are commonly found in office supply stores or are easily ordered online. With unwieldy requirements you may be hesitant to head out. Even worse is to arrive on location and realize you&#x2019;ve forgotten your &#x201c;special&#x201d; brushes or sketchbook. With a lightweight satchel or backpack always ready to go, you&#x2019;ll have fewer obstacles to keep you from diving in. <br> &nbsp;<br> Here is a complete list of my favorite tools and materials. They are dependable and well-suited to the techniques described in the following chapters.<br> &nbsp;<br><i><b>Paper</b> </i><br>When I began sketchbook journaling, I used cheap, student-grade sketchbooks with thin nonabsorbent paper that wrinkled if I applied washes. They were the cheapest books available, and because I drew for my eyes only, it didn&#x2019;t matter to me that the books should last. In the margins of those early books are to-do lists, phone numbers, drafts of school assignments, and rambling diary entries. If someone asked to see them, I felt a need to read over his shoulder, ready to flip quickly past pages of sentimentality, ill-formed fantasies, regrets, and obsessions. <br> &nbsp;<br> But when sketching became a daily habit and I began to take drawing more seriously, I wanted more robust paper. India ink washes and watercolors require heavier paper that can hold several layers of wet media. I no longer use my sketchbooks for to-do lists, financial calculations, and fretful midnight worries. Although some sketchbook journalists incorporate text with interesting results, I have separate, lined notebooks for all that.<br> &nbsp;<br> The best paper for working with pen, ink, and watercolor is cold-press multi-purpose (or all-purpose) paper, which is a cross between watercolor paper and drawing paper. On coarse watercolor paper, the sharp nib of a pen will pull up the fibers and the line may skip and stutter across the rough paper surface. Smooth, hot-press drawing paper takes too long to dry and will not absorb the many ink washes and watercolor layers that I apply.<br> &nbsp;<br> After experimenting with different sketchbooks and paper, I prefer Canson Montval All-Purpose spiral sketchbooks and buy them in bulk from my local art supply store. This paper is the perfect blend of absorbency and smoothness. I pull out the spiral bindings and replace them with three or four one-inch binder rings because otherwise the edge of the drawing near the binding won&#x2019;t lay flat on a scanner&#x2019;s glass plate, causing the drawing to be out of focus. The rings are easy to unsnap, so pages can be removed and scanned flat. The binder rings also allow me to swap pages and organize sketchbooks by subject. I have books that contain, for example, only still lifes, exteriors, or diary comics.<br><br><i><b>Pencils</b></i><br>It can be a challenge to give up a dependence on pencils and erasers but liberating when you do. The minimal pencil work we&#x2019;ll do will be quick and gestural and erased all at once when we finish inking. Soft leads such as a 2B or softer are easier to erase. Pencils without erasers will help you avoid the temptation to tighten up and become too fussy from the start. If you use a mechanical pencil you won&#x2019;t need a sharpener, but broken leads and mechanical glitches can be distracting nuisances when you&#x2019;re in the flow of a drawing. I like Kimberly 2B pencils by General Pencil, but I&#x2019;ve borrowed pencils from baristas and grocery clerks in a pinch and it&#x2019;s made no difference.<br> &nbsp;<br><i><b>Erasers</b> </i><br> Kneaded erasers are soft, last a long time, and can be pulled apart into smaller sizes. (Once, while I was sketching in Acapulco, a group of local kids gathered around to watch. I gave each of them paper from my sketchbook and tore my eraser into smaller pieces for them to share.) Pink erasers dry out and leave streaks on your drawing. Vigorous rubbing wears down your paper&#x2019;s tooth. I like the kneaded erasers by Prismacolor.<br> &nbsp;<br><i><b>Drawing pens</b></i>&nbsp;<br>I prefer to draw with a pen because I&#x2019;m a neatnik. Graphite smears. Pastels leave colored dust on everything. Oil and acrylic need to be washed out of brushes. Drawing directly with a pen helps me be more direct and decisive. When signing a document, we don&#x2019;t fussily correct our signatures, and a drawing can be as personal and direct as signing your name. <br> &nbsp;<br> The workhorse of my technique is the easy-to-find and inexpensive Uni-ball Vision pen. I buy them in bulk at office supply stores. They can even be found in some drug and convenience stores. I use the &#x201c;fine&#x201d; (.07) point for contours and the &#x201c;micro&#x201d; (.05) point for smaller details and hatching. The ink is completely waterproof and quick drying, which is essential for applying washes and watercolor layers over the ink lines. If you try other pens, choose carefully! There are many &#x201c;waterproof&#x201d; pens that are merely water resistant. Test them before committing to a long sketch by drawing a few lines and then brushing clean water across them (or just trying to smear the ink with a wet finger). <br> &nbsp;<br> An advantage of the Uni-ball Vision pen is that the line width is uniform and consistent. A disadvantage of the pen is that the line width is uniform and consistent! Pressing harder or softer will not vary the line width, so it is not as expressive as a brush pen or dip pen with a flexible nib. However, there are ways to achieve an expressive and varied line width, which we&#x2019;ll go over in later chapters. Many of my sketching friends love Micron pens, which come in many widths and colors. I find the Micron has to be held perpendicular to the page, much like a technical pen, which is not my natural grip. I suggest you try them out for yourself.<br><br>...<br><br><b>Demonstration: Still Life with Lightbulb</b><br><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<b>Step 1: Loose pencil guides&nbsp;</b><br>Use a soft pencil to lightly indicate placement of the major &#x201c;chunks&#x201d; in your scene.&nbsp;<i>This is not a drawing!</i>&nbsp;I cannot emphasize this enough. In my classes and workshops I have been known to pluck pencils away from students who spend time &#x201c;drafting.&#x201d; Don&#x2019;t pencil anything recognizable. You are merely giving yourself parameters, establishing the major pieces of info within which to place the details. If you spend a lot of time erasing, correcting, and fussing, you&#x2019;ll deaden and polish away the little variations and serendipitous anomalies that make your drawing&nbsp;<i>your</i>drawing. Like scratching the boundaries of a volleyball game in the sand, the pencil lines let you know if you&#x2019;re going too far out of bounds to keep the real drawing on the page.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>{ILLUSTRATION}<br>The original setup<br>&nbsp;<br>{ILLUSTRATION}<br>My rough pencil guides&nbsp;<br><i>&nbsp;</i><br><b>Step 2: Contours</b><br>Using your pencil lines as a general guide, start in the foreground with your Uni-ball fine (.07) point pen and draw carefully observed contours. Because you&#x2019;re working in pen, you must draw the foreground objects first and work your way toward the back. Take your time but don&#x2019;t &#x201c;sketch&#x201d; with scratchy, hairy, tentative lines. Start at the beginning of a contour, continue until you come to the end, and then stop, just as you would write your signature. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>{ILLUSTRATION}<br>Start with the contours in the foreground, then work your way toward the back.<br>&nbsp;<br>Don&#x2019;t prejudge your drawing at this stage. Wobbly lines, distortions, and wonky proportions will tempt you to start over. Don&#x2019;t. Your lines cannot help but have your personal stylistic stamp. When you fill the page with the kind of lines that only you can make, the consistency of your style will unify the drawing. As they say in jazz music, &#x201c;If you make a mistake, make it three times.&#x201d; Don&#x2019;t try to correct or redraw wonky lines. Commit to a line, draw it once in ink, and move on. Leave them be. They&#x2019;re&nbsp;<i>perfect</i>. Excellent. Beautiful. Next line. Move on.<br>&nbsp;<br>When your contours lines are finished, use a kneaded eraser to remove all pencil lines. If you find it difficult to completely erase any pencil marks, then you probably drew too many or pressed too hard.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>{ILLUSTRATION}<br>Erase the pencil lines for the finished contour drawing.<br>&nbsp;<br><b>Step 3: Ink wash&nbsp;</b><br>Squint at your scene to observe only darks and lights. Apply one smooth layer of light (20 percent) ink wash to isolate the highlights and bright whites. Use a fairly large brush, #6 or #8, to cover everywhere that is&nbsp;<i>not</i>&nbsp;white. (This will include most of your drawing unless you are painting a polar bear in a snowstorm.) Use as little liquid as possible by swabbing off the brush inside the rim of your jar. If your paper is already buckling, you&#x2019;re using too much water or your paper is not robust enough. Don&#x2019;t scrub or fuss. Hit it and quit it and let it dry.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>{ILLUSTRATION}<br>The first ink wash isolates the highlights and bright whites.<br>&nbsp;<br>After the first layer dries completely, squint again at your subject and brush on another layer of the same light ink wash to darken the shadow areas.&nbsp;<i>Don&#x2019;t apply ink anywhere you left white.</i>Those areas are highlights. That&#x2019;s why you left them white, right? Only put the second ink layer inside the perimeter of your first wash. This is a good reason to use a fairly dry brush; otherwise, your paper will get soggy and warped and yucky. Let it dry. (Yes, you have to wait. Stand up and stretch. Move around. Go clean the cat box.)&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>{ILLUSTRATION}<br>Apply a second ink wash to darken the shadow areas.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Finally, apply your third and final layer of wash to really deepen those nooks and crannies. You can apply another layer of the same wash, but to speed things along and really increase the contrast, I use a different, darker ink solution or add a drop or two of ink to the one I&#x2019;ve been using.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>{ILLUSTRATION}<br>After the third and final ink wash&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><b>Step 4: Watercolor glazing&nbsp;</b><br>Apply very diluted washes of color. You can always add more saturation, but you can&#x2019;t remove color, so sneak up on it gradually. While applying a color, look carefully for reflections and objects that share that color. Here, the red ink bottle is reflecting on the green bowl, and the orange pencil sharpener reflects on the glass jar.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>{ILLUSTRATION}<br>Start with a wash of light color, then build up the color, especially in the shaded areas, to increase contrast.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><b>Step 5: Final details</b><br>Looks good, yes? Now let&#x2019;s add the hatching. It takes practice. Use your thinnest Uni-ball (the .05 micro point) and hatch little parallel lines where you want your super-duper blacks. I also hatch to indicate surface &#x201c;direction&#x201d; and to add surface details like wood grain, fur, design elements, and so on. This is your last chance to add details that you rightfully didn&#x2019;t draw yet because they weren&#x2019;t&nbsp;<i>contours</i>. (With your .07 pen you only drew actual contours, right?)<br>&nbsp;<br>{ILLUSTRATION}<br>The final drawing, with hatching lines added&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Sign and date it. It&#x2019;s beautiful. It&#x2019;s perfect.&nbsp;<i>You&#x2019;re</i>&nbsp;perfect. Congratulations. Now do another one.<br>&nbsp;<br>Then do another.<br>&nbsp;<br>And another...<br>&nbsp;<br>...<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>INTERIORS: DRAWING IN PUBLIC</b><br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<i>&#x201c;Photography is an immediate reaction, drawing is a meditation.&#x201d; </i><br> &#x2014;Henri Cartier-Bresson<br> &nbsp;<br> After practicing with manageable still lifes in controlled environments, we&#x2019;re ready to take our show on the road and apply the same approach to large, cluttered environments. <br> &nbsp;<br> Learning to draw on location can change your life. It changed mine. It has heightened my awareness of the city in which I live and inspired me to travel around the world sketching the details of my adventures. Travel sketching has introduced me to artists and locations I never would have seen were it not for the global network of location sketchers.<br> &nbsp;<br> There&#x2019;s nothing wrong with sitting at your desk drawing from photos. In the studio, I test new pens and inking techniques. I draw portraits of inspirational artists, writers, and musicians (shown on pages 95-100). I draw from images found on the internet. I keep a daily journal of diary comics based on memories, plans, and dreams. It&#x2019;s a relaxing, private, introspective activity that I&#x2019;ve kept up for forty years. But come down from the ivory tower and mix with the masses and it&#x2019;s a different experience. Observe the world on location. Draw from observation. Be part of the action. Let the real world intrude and jostle your elbow and let the marks be a record of your experience. <br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Getting Comfortable</b><br> If you have yet to venture out, drawing on location can be intimidating. You may be nervous about being observed in case your drawing goes poorly. But once you get used to it, you&#x2019;ll find your fears are mostly unfounded. Here are some strategies I&#x2019;ve used at different times:<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>�&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Start slowly</i>.

This was only her second week at St. Dominic&#x2019;s, one of London&#x2019;s most exclusive private hospitals. Rock stars and television celebrities came here, she had been told. There were also VIPs from abroad. VIPs here meant very important patients. Even famous people get sick, and the ones who wanted to recover in five-star comfort chose St. Dominic&#x2019;s. The surgeons and therapists were world-class. The hospital food was so good that some patients had been known to pretend they were ill so that they could enjoy it for a while longer.That evening, the nurse was making her way down a wide, brightly lit corridor, carrying a tray of medicines. She was wearing a freshly laundered white dress. Her name&#x2014;d. meacher&#x2014;was printed on a badge pinned to her uniform. Several of the junior doctors had already placed bets on which of them would persuade her to go out with them first.</p><p>She stopped in front of an open door. Room nine.</p><p>&#x201c;Hello,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m Diana Meacher.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m looking forward to meeting you too,&#x201d; the boy in room nine replied.</p><p>Alex Rider was sitting up in bed, reading a French textbook that he should have been studying at school. He was wearing pajamas that had fallen open at the neck and the nurse could just make out the bandages crisscrossing his chest. He was a very handsome boy, she thought. He had fair hair and serious brown eyes that looked as though they had seen too much. She knew that he was only fourteen, but he looked older. Pain had done that to him. Nurse Meacher had read his medical file and understood what he had been through.</p><p>In truth, he should have been dead. Alex Rider had been hit by a bullet fired from a .22 rifle from a distance of almost 250 feet. The sniper had been aiming for his heart&#x2014;and if the bullet had found its target, Alex would have had no chance of surviving. But nothing is certain&#x2014;not even murder. A tiny movement had saved his life. As he had come out of MI6&#x2019;s headquarters on Liverpool Street, he had stepped off the sidewalk, his right foot carrying his body down toward the level of the road. It was at that exact moment that the bullet had hit him, and instead of powering into his heart, it had entered his body half an inch higher, ricocheting off a rib and exiting horizontally under his left arm.</p><p>The bullet had missed his vital heart structures, but even so, it had done plenty of damage, tearing through the subclavian artery, which carries blood over the top of the lung and into the arm. This was what Alex had felt when he was hit. As blood had poured out of the severed artery, filling the space between the lung and the thoracic cage, he had found himself unable to breathe. Alex could easily have died from shock or loss of blood. If he had been a man, he almost certainly would have. But the body of a child is different from that of an adult. A young person&#x2019;s artery will automatically shut itself down if cut&#x2014;doctors can&#x2019;t explain how or why&#x2014;and this will limit the amount of blood lost. Alex was unconscious, but he was still breathing, four minutes later, when the first ambulance arrived.There wasn&#x2019;t much the paramedics could do: IV fluids, oxygen, and some gentle compression around the bullet&#x2019;s point of entry. But that was enough. Alex had been rushed to St. Dominic&#x2019;s, where surgeons had removed the bone fragments and put a graft on the artery. He had been in the operating room two and a half hours.And now he was looking almost as if nothing had happened. As the nurse came into the room, he closed the book and settled back into his pillows. Diana Meacher knew that this was his last night in the hospital. He had been here for ten days and tomorrow he was going home. She also knew that she wasn&#x2019;t allowed to ask too many questions. It was there in large print on his file:</p><p>PATIENT 9/75958 RIDER/ALEX:</p><p>SPECIAL STATUS (MISO). </p><p>NO UNAUTHORIZED VISITORS. NO PRESS. </p><p>REFER ALL INQUIRIES TO DR. HAYWARD.</p><p>It was all very strange. She had been told she would meet some interesting people at St. Dominic&#x2019;s, and she had been required to sign a confidentiality clause before she began work. But she&#x2019;d never expected anything like this. MISO stood for Military Intelligence: Special Operations. But what was the secret service doing with a teenage boy? How had Alex managed to get himself shot? And why had there been two armed policemen sitting outside his room for the first four days of his stay? Diana tried to push these thoughts out of her mind as she put the tray down. Maybe she should have stuck with the NHS.&#x201c;How are you feeling?&#x201d; she asked.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m fine, thanks.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Looking forward to going home?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;</p><p>Diana realized she was staring at Alex and turned her attention to the medicines. &#x201c;Are you in any pain?&#x201d; she asked. &#x201c;Can I get you something to help you sleep?&#x201d;&#x201c;No, I&#x2019;m all right.&#x201d; Alex shook his head and for a moment something flickered in his eyes. The pain in his chest had slowly faded, but he knew it would never leave him completely. He could feel it now, vague and distant, like a bad memory.</p><p>&#x201c;Would you like me to come back later?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, it&#x2019;s all right, thanks.&#x201d; He smiled. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t need anyone to tuck me in.&#x201d;</p><p>Diana blushed. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s not what I meant,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;But if you need me, I&#x2019;ll be just down the hall. You can call me anytime.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I might do that.&#x201d;</p><p>The nurse picked up her tray and walked out of the room. She left behind the scent of her perfume&#x2014;heather and spring flowers&#x2014;in the air. Alex sniffed. It seemed to him that since his injury, his senses had become more acute.</p><p>He reached for his French book, then changed his mind. To hell with it, he thought. Irregular verbs could wait. It was his own future that concerned him more.He looked around at the neat, softly lit room that tried hard to pretend it belonged to an expensive hotel rather than a hospital. There was a TV on a table in the corner, operated by a remote control beside the bed. A window looked out over a wide north London street lined with trees. His room was on the second floor, one of about a dozen arranged in a ring around a bright and modern reception area. In the early days after his operation, there had been flowers everywhere, but Alex had asked for them to be taken away. They&#x2019;d reminded him of a funeral parlor and he had decided he preferred being alive.</p><p>But there were still cards. He had received more than twenty and he&#x2019;d been surprised how many people had heard that he&#x2019;d been hurt&#x2014;and how many had sent a card. There had been a dozen from school: one from the head; one from Miss Bedfordshire, the school secretary; and several from his friends. Tom Harris had sent him some photos taken on their trip to Venice and a note:</p><p>They told us it&#x2019;s appendercitis but I bet it isn&#x2019;t.</p><p>Get well soon anyway.</p><p>Tom was the only person at Brookland who knew the truth about Alex.</p><p>Sabina Pleasure had somehow discovered he was in the hospital and had sent him a card from San Francisco. She was enjoying life in America but missed England, she said. She was hoping to come over for Christmas. Jack Starbright had sent him the biggest card in the room and had followed it up with chocolates, magazines, and energy drinks, visiting him twice a day. There was even a card from the prime minister&#x2019;s office&#x2014;although it seemed the prime minister had been too busy to sign it.</p><p>And there had been cards from MI6. One from Mrs. Jones, another from Alan Blunt (a printed message with a single word&#x2014;blunt&#x2014;signed in green ink as if it were a memorandum, not a get-well card). Alex had been surprised and pleased to receive a card from Wolf, the soldier he had met while training with the SAS. The postmark showed it had been mailed in Baghdad. But his favorite had been sent by Smithers. On the front was a teddy bear. There was no message inside, but when Alex opened the card, the teddy bear&#x2019;s eyes blinked and it began to talk.</p><p>&#x201c;Alex&#x2014;very sorry to hear you&#x2019;ve been hurt.&#x201d; The bear was speaking with Smithers&#x2019; voice. &#x201c;Hope you get better soon, old chap. Just take it easy&#x2014;I&#x2019;m sure you deserve a rest. Oh, and by the way, this card will self-destruct in five seconds.&#x201d;</p><p>Sure enough, to the horror of the nurses, the card had immediately burst into flames.</p><p>As well as cards, there had been visitors. Mrs. Jones had been the first.</p><p>Alex had only just come around after surgery when she appeared. He had never seen the deputy head of Special Operations looking quite so unsure of herself. She was wearing a charcoal-gray raincoat, which hung open to reveal a dark suit underneath. Her hair was wet and raindrops glistened on her shoulders.</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t quite know what to say to you, Alex,&#x201d; she began. She hadn&#x2019;t asked him how he was. She would have already gotten that from the doctors. &#x201c;What happened to you on Liverpool Street was an unforgivable lapse of security. Too many people know the location of our headquarters. We&#x2019;re going to stop using the main entrance. It&#x2019;s too dangerous.&#x201d;</p><p>Alex shifted uncomfortably in the bed but said nothing.</p><p>&#x201c;Your condition is stable. I can&#x2019;t tell you how relieved I am personally. When I heard you&#x2019;d been shot, I . . .&#x201d; She stopped herself. Her black eyes looked down, taking in the tubes and wires attached to the boy lying in front of her, feeding into his arm, nose, mouth, and stomach. &#x201c;I know you can&#x2019;t talk now,&#x201d; she went on. &#x201c;So I&#x2019;ll be brief.</p><p>&#x201c;You are safe here. We&#x2019;ve used St. Dominic&#x2019;s before, and certain procedures are being followed. There are guards outside your room. Someone will be there twenty-four hours a day as long as necessary.</p><p>&#x201c;The shooting on Liverpool Street was reported in the press, but your name was kept out of it. Your age too. The sniper who fired at you had taken a position on the roof opposite. We&#x2019;re still investigating how he managed to get up there without being detected&#x2014;and I&#x2019;m afraid we&#x2019;ve been unable to find him. But right now, your safety is our primary concern. We can talk to Scorpia. As you know, we&#x2019;ve had dealings with them in the past. I&#x2019;m sure I can persuade them to leave you alone. You destroyed their operation, Alex, and they punished you. But enough is enough.&#x201d;</p><p>She stopped. Alex&#x2019;s heart monitor pulsed softly in the dim light.</p><p>&#x201c;Please try not to think too badly of us,&#x201d; she added. &#x201c;After everything you&#x2019;ve been through&#x2014;Scorpia, your father . . . I will never forgive myself for what happened. I sometimes think it was wrong of us ever to get you involved in the first place. But we can talk about that another time.&#x201d;</p><p>Alex was too weak to reply. He watched as Mrs. Jones got up and left, and he guessed that Scorpia must have decided to leave him alone, because a few days later the armed guards outside his room quietly disappeared.</p><p>And now, in just over twelve hours, he would be out of here too. Jack had already been planning the weeks ahead. She wanted to take him on vacation to Florida or perhaps the Caribbean. It was October and the summer was definitely over, leaves falling and cold breezes coming in with the night. Jack wanted Alex to rest and regain his strength in the sun&#x2014;but secretly he wasn&#x2019;t so sure. He picked up the textbook again. He never thought he&#x2019;d hear himself say this, but the truth was he just wanted to go back to school. He wanted to be ordinary again. Scorpia had sent him a simple, unforgettable message. Being a spy could get him killed. Irregular verbs were less dangerous.</p><p>There was a movement at the door and a boy looked in.</p><p>&#x201c;Hi, Alex.&#x201d;</p><p>The boy had a strange accent&#x2014;Eastern European, possibly Russian. He was fourteen, with short blond hair and light blue eyes. His face was thin, his skin pale. He was wearing pajamas and a large dressing gown, which made him seem smaller than he was. He was staying in the room next door to Alex and really had been treated for appendicitis, with complications. His name was Paul Drevin&#x2014;the surname was somehow familiar&#x2014;but Alex didn&#x2019;t know anything more about him. The two of them had spoken briefly a few times. They were nearly the same age, and the only teenagers on the corridor.</p><p>Alex raised a hand in greeting. &#x201c;Hi.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I hear you&#x2019;re getting out of here tomorrow,&#x201d; Paul said.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes. How about you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Another day, worst luck.&#x201d; He hovered in the doorway. He seemed to want to come in, but at the same time something held him back. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be glad to leave,&#x201d; he admitted. &#x201c;I want to go home.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Where is home?&#x201d; Alex asked.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not sure.&#x201d; Paul was completely serious. &#x201c;We live in London a lot of the time. But my father&#x2019;s always moving. Moscow, New York, the South of France . . . he&#x2019;s been too busy even to come in and see me. And we have so many houses, I sometimes wonder which is my home.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Where do you go to school?&#x201d; Alex had picked up on the mention of Moscow and assumed that Paul must be Russian.</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t go to school; I have tutors.&#x201d; Paul shrugged. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s difficult. My life&#x2019;s sort of weird, because of my father. Because of everything. Anyway, I&#x2019;m jealous of you getting out before me. Good luck.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thanks.&#x201d;</p><p>Paul hesitated a fraction longer, then left. Alex gazed thoughtfully at the empty doorway. Perhaps his father was some sort of politician or banker. On the few occasions they had spoken, he&#x2019;d gotten the impression that the other boy was friendless. He wondered how many kids were admitted into this hospital who had fathers willing to spend thousands to make them better, but who had no time to visit them while they were there.</p><p>It was nine o&#x2019;clock. Alex flicked through the television channels, but there was nothing on. He wished now that he had accepted the sleeping pill from the nurse. A little sip of water and he would have been out for the night. And out of the hospital the next day. Alex was looking forward to that more than anything. He needed to start his life again.</p><p>He watched half an hour of a comedy that didn&#x2019;t make him laugh. Then he switched off the television, turned off the light, and curled up in the bed one last time. He rather wished Diana Meacher had come back to see him. Briefly he remembered the scent of her perfume. And then he was asleep.</p><p>But not for long.</p><p>The next thing Alex knew, it was half past twelve. There was a clock beside the bed, its numerals glowing in the dark. He woke up reluctantly, trying to climb back down into the pit from which he had come. The truth was, it was difficult to sleep when he had done nothing to make him tired. All day he&#x2019;d been lying there, breathing in the clean, conditioned atmosphere that at St. Dominic&#x2019;s passed for air.</p><p>He lay in the semidarkness, wondering what to do. Then he got up and slipped into his dressing gown. This was the worst thing about being in the hospital. There was no way out, nowhere to go. Alex couldn&#x2019;t get used to it. Every night for a week, he&#x2019;d woken up at about the same time, and finally he&#x2019;d decided to break the rules and escape from the sterile box that was his room. He wanted to be outside. He needed the smell of London, the noise of the traffic, the feeling that he still belonged to the real world.</p><p>He put on a pair of slippers and went out. The lights had been dimmed, casting no more than a discreet glow outside his room. There was a computer screen gleaming behind the nurses&#x2019; station but no sign of Diana Meacher or any...</p></p><h2>Intro to Jazz Piano: Hal Leonard Keyboard Style Series</h2><p>This comprehensive book/CD is the perfect Intro to Jazz Piano.

Only the medicine he has to take daily and the thick scar above his heart set him apart from the other high-schoolers. Then one day Jack skips his medicine. Suddenly, he is stronger, fiercer, and more confident than ever before. And it feels great-until he loses control of his own strength and nearly kills another player during soccer team tryouts.<br><br>Soon, Jack learns the startling truth about himself: He is Weirlind; part of an underground society of magical people who live among us. At the head of this magical society sit the feuding houses of the Red Rose and the White Rose, whose power is determined by playing The Game-a magical tournament in which each house sponsors a warrior to fight to the death. The winning house rules the Weir. <br><br>As if his bizarre magical heritage isn't enough, Jack finds out that he's not just another member of Weirlind-he's one of the last of the warriors-at a time when both houses are scouting for a player.</p><p><strong>Cinda Williams Chima </strong>made her debut as a young adult author with <em>The Warrior Heir.</em> Cinda is a graduate of the University of Akron, where she now teaches. A freelance writer, she has published more than 100 reviews, feature articles, and essays in local and national media. Her nutrition column appears regularly in the Taste section of the <i>Plain Dealer</i>. Chima lives in Ohio with her husband and two sons.Grade 5-9&#x2013;An apparently ordinary 16-year-old boy turns out to have magical powers that make him a target of a covert society of wizards, enchanters, and warriors called the Weir. Jack's small-town world in Ohio begins to unravel when he starts to unleash unintentional bursts of wizardry. When he recovers a powerful sword from an ancestor's grave, he begins to realize how different he really is. A battle with a wizard and some magic-laced conflicts at his high school keep the pages turning while the truth about Jack's destiny slowly emerges. The scene switches to Great Britain, where he learns that he must participate in a duel to the death against a mysterious opponent. Many details about the Weir are initially hidden from readers, as well as from Jack, so the gradual revelations about the society are involving and often surprising. Jack makes a fairly convincing hero. He is disbelieving at first and reluctant throughout, but ultimately finds a way to utilize his new powers without sacrificing his honor or basic decency. An appealing mixture of supporting characters includes relatives with various magical abilities, a couple of nonmagical but loyal friends, and an engaging assortment of villains. Occasional plot developments are unconvincing, as when Jack's protective aunt, an enchanter, takes him straight into the clutches of a wizard who clearly wants the young warrior in her power. For the most part, though, the teen's unavoidable involvement in the intricate world of the Weir is suspenseful and entertaining.<i>&#x2013;Steven Engelfried, Beaverton City Library, OR</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

To them, blond, blue-eyed Ayla looks peculiar and ugly&#x2014;she is one of the Others, those who have moved into their ancient homeland; but Iza cannot leave the girl to die and takes her with them. Iza and Creb, the old Mog-ur, grow to love her, and as Ayla learns the ways of the Clan and Iza&#x2019;s way of healing, most come to accept her. But the brutal and proud youth who is destined to become their next leader sees her differences as a threat to his authority. He develops a deep and abiding hatred for the strange girl of the Others who lives in their midst, and is determined to get his revenge.</p><p>When her parents are killed by an earthquake, 5-year-old Ayla wanders through the forest completely alone. Cold, hungry, and badly injured by a cave lion, the little girl is as good as gone until she is discovered by a group who call themselves the Clan of the Cave Bear. This clan, left homeless by the same disaster, have little interest in the helpless girl who comes from the tribe they refer to as the "Others." Only their medicine woman sees in Ayla a fellow human, worthy of care. She painstakingly nurses her back to health--a decision that will forever alter the physical and emotional structure of the clan. Although this story takes place roughly 35,000 years ago, its cast of characters could easily slide into any modern tale. The members of the Neanderthal clan, ruled by traditions and taboos, find themselves challenged by this outsider, who represents the physically modern Cro-Magnons. And as Ayla begins to grow and mature, her natural tendencies emerge, putting her in the middle of a brutal and dangerous power struggle.<p> Although Jean Auel obviously takes certain liberties with the actions and motivations of all our ancestors, her extensive research into the Ice Age does shine through--especially in the detailed knowledge of plants and natural remedies used by the medicine woman and passed down to Ayla. Mostly, though, this first in the series of four is a wonderful story of survival. Ayla's personal evolution is a compelling and relevant tale. <i>--Sara Nickerson</i></p>The stunning epic that stirred the imagination of millions. Here is a novel of awesome beauty and power. A moving saga about people, relationships and the boundaries of love. Through Jean Auel&#39;s magnificent storytelling, we are taken back to the dawn of mankind and swept up in the wonderful world of a very special heroine, Ayla. Her enthralling story is one we all can share. A natural disaster has left young Ayla alone, wandering, fending for herself in an unfamiliar land. One day, she is discovered by the Clan of the Cave bear, men and women far different from her own people.

Thirty-five states have approved the Nineteenth Amendment, granting women the right to vote; one last state--Tennessee--is needed for women's voting rights to be the law of the land. The suffragists face vicious opposition from politicians, clergy, corporations, and racists who don't want black women voting. And then there are the "Antis"--women who oppose their own enfranchisement, fearing suffrage will bring about the nation's moral collapse. And in one hot summer, they all converge for a confrontation, replete with booze and blackmail, betrayal and courage. Following a handful of remarkable women who led their respective forces into battle, <i>The Woman's Hour </i>is the gripping story of how America's women won their own freedom, and the opening campaign in the great twentieth-century battles for civil rights.</p><p>Elaine Weiss is an award-winning journalist and writer whose work has appeared in <i>The Atlantic, Harper's, The New York Times</i>, and <i>The Christian Science Monitor</i>, as well as in reports and documentaries for National Public Radio and Voice of America.

In the hours she wasn't reading field reports and legal documents, rimless eyeglasses perched on her nose, she read the newspapers and indulged in the guilty pleasure of a detective novel.<br><br> By the time the train pulled into Nashville in the dusky twilight, it was hard to make out the copper-and-bronze statue of the messenger god Mercury perched atop the Union Station tower, greeting travelers to the bustling capital city. Minerva, the warrior goddess, might have been a more fitting figure for the president of the National American Woman Suffrage Association, Susan B. Anthony's anointed heir, the supreme commander of its great suffrage army, the woman they called "the Chief." Carrie Catt had been summoned to lead her troops into the fray one last time. At least she dearly hoped this might be the last time.<br><br> She'd already devoted half of her life to the Cause, three decades of constant work and travel. Her hair was silver and wavy, and she wore it short and brushed close, parted in the center, easy to groom on the run. Her face, once angular and strikingly handsome, was fleshier now. Her heavy eyelids drooped a bit, and the line of her jaw had softened, but she retained the same sly, thin-lipped smile, piercing blue eyes, and arched eyebrows that made her look either surprised, amused, or annoyed depending upon how she deployed them. She was definitely not amused this evening; she was worried, and she wasn't sure she could take the strain much longer.<br><br> It was Catt's job-more precisely, her life's mission-to guide American women to the promised land of political freedom, securing for them the most basic right of democracy, the vote. For more than seventy years, since that first audacious meeting in Seneca Falls in 1848, generations of her suffrage sisters had faced public disdain, humiliation, rotten eggs, violent opposition, and prison as they petitioned, campaigned, lobbied, marched, and pleaded for their simple rights as citizens. Now the promise of the franchise, so long delayed, was within sight; the political emancipation of half of the United States' citizens was at stake. And here, of all places, where she'd never imagined it possible, in the South, in Nashville.Tennessee could become the elusive thirty-sixth state to ratify the federal woman suffrage amendment. Or it could end the quest in failure.<br><br> The Tennessee legislature would soon be called into special session to vote on ratifying the Nineteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, popularly called "the Susan B. Anthony Amendment," one simple sentence stating that a citizen's right to vote could not be denied on account of sex. Nothing revolutionary, to Carrie Catt's mind. It was really just a clarification, an essential correction, of the Founding Fathers' damned shortsightedness.<br><br> Just over a year earlier, in June 1919, the amendment had finally been pushed through both houses of the U.S. Congress-after forty years of willful delay. Catt had kicked up her heels and broken into a wild dance when that news arrived. The amendment then moved to the states for ratification. She knew it would be a tough slog: suffragists had to convince at least thirty-six state legislatures-three-quarters of the forty-eight states in the Union-to accept the amendment, while those opposed needed just thirteen states to vote it down and kill it. The ratification campaign proved even slower and uglier than Catt expected; she had been sure it would be over by now, but it wasn't. By midsummer 1920, thirty-five states had ratified the amendment, eight had rejected, three were refusing to consider; North Carolina and Tennessee were still up in the air, but North Carolina was a sure bet to reject. That left only Tennessee as a possible thirty-sixth state.<br><br> If the Tennessee legislature could be persuaded, pressured, cajoled, and coerced (all these techniques would be needed, Catt was certain) to ratify the amendment, suffrage would become federal law, allowing every woman, in every state, to vote in all elections. Victory at last, hallelujah, and just in time for the upcoming presidential election.<br><br> But if Tennessee did not ratify, derailing the full enfranchisement of twenty-seven million women before the fall elections, all might be lost. The momentum was stalling after several state legislatures had voted down ratification this past spring and summer. Although the "No" votes in Georgia and Louisiana had surprised no one-nearly every southern state of the old Confederacy had rejected the amendment-the loss in more moderate, mid-Atlantic Delaware was a shock. A defeat in Tennessee, which enjoyed stronger suffrage sympathies and deeper organization than the other southern states, would allow the forces against suffrage to gain strength, new legal obstacles to be thrown into the path, men to forget what women had contributed to the Great War effort, women to lose heart. That crucial sense of inevitability, the public assumption that to support woman suffrage was simply to keep in step with the march of progress, was faltering. And that infuriating question-is America really ready for women to vote, to be equal citizens?-was bubbling up again. Adding to her agitation, the newspapers were filled with the sorts of stories that gave Americans good reason to be in a sour mood.<br><br> Even after seventeen million people had been killed in the so-called Great War, the world was still aflame. The Russian Bolsheviks were invading Poland and vowing to advance into Romania and Bulgaria, Latvia, and Lithuania; the Ottoman Turks were fighting the Greeks while continuing to massacre and deport Armenians; the Irish nationalist Sinn F&#x17d;in was skirmishing with British troops. Mexico was spiraling into civil war again; factions were battling in China. The premise, trumpeted by so many posters and in so many parades, that American men had fought and died in the War to End All Wars looked to be a fake.<br><br> Even the peace seemed chimerical: the negotiations at Paris had dragged on for months, and the U.S. Senate had recently refused to accept the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, objecting to President Wilson's plan for a League of Nations to settle international disputes. Americans wanted nothing more to do with foreign entanglements. Catt thought the league was the only good thing to come out of the horrible war; she'd written and spoken in its favor and was disgusted by the backlash against it.<br><br> The war had brought neither the peace nor the prosperity the nation had been promised. As Catt's train sped toward Nashville, streetcar workers were striking in Chicago, coal miners were stuck in long, bloody lockouts in West Virginia, Kentucky, and Illinois, garment workers were threatening in New Jersey. There'd been nationwide steel mill, coal, railroad, and shipbuilding strikes in 1919-more than two thousand strikes around the country-while race riots had erupted in many cities. The postwar economic recession had now deepened into a full-blown depression. National Prohibition, which Catt had supported as a way to protect women and children from alcohol-fueled abuse, was only adding to the climate of violence, as federal agents pulled their enforcement shotguns on backwoods moonshiners and city bootleggers while mobsters jockeyed for turf with machine guns.<br><br> Anarchists were taking advantage of the turmoil, and accounts of exploding bombs in mail packages, in cars, and in offices and homes were a staple news item. The government was responding with raids, mass arrests, and deportations of suspected radicals (a pair of Italian anarchists, Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti had recently been arrested in Massachusetts) authorized by Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer, whose own home had been bombed the year before. The "Palmer Raids" were executed by his ambitious young assistant J. Edgar Hoover, who'd begun keeping secret files on those who questioned or criticized the government, anyone who wasn't a "Good American." Carrie Catt was also being watched.<br><br> And every day this summer there was another article about a cheeky fellow in Boston named Charles Ponzi, who had convinced thousands of people to give him their money with promises of too-good-to-be-true investment returns: double your money in ninety days. Ponzi's clever pyramid scheme was definitely too good to be true, and he would soon be under arrest. Even the national pastime, baseball, was under a cloud of suspicion: rumors were circulating that several Chicago White Sox players had deliberately made bad plays to throw the 1919 World Series in exchange for cash from gamblers. All this only added to the national dyspepsia; Americans felt as if they'd been fed too many lies, taken for chumps one too many times.<br><br> The newly minted presidential candidates had quickly picked up on the zeitgeist. Republican nominee Warren Harding was already talking about a return to "normalcy" and "America First," which Catt understood meant a retreat from progressive ideas and a slide back to comfortable, conservative policies. Democrat James Cox was carefully hedging his bets on everything. If the amendment didn't pass now, before the election, before the nation swung into an isolationist, reactionary frame of mind, it might never pass at all.<br><br> Miss Josephine Pearson was dusty from the soot flying into her train�s open windows and a bit stiff from the hard wooden-slat seat, but she didn�t mind the discomforts. Pearson had received a telegram earlier that Saturday afternoon at her home in Monteagle, a hamlet perched high on Tennessee�s Cumberland Plateau.<br><br> "Mrs. Catt arrived. Our forces are being notified to rally at once. Send orders-and come immediately." She was to take command in Nashville.<br><br> The summons thrilled her. As president of the Tennessee State Association Opposed to Woman Suffrage and also head of the state division of the Southern Women's League for the Rejection of the Susan B. Anthony Amendment, Josephine was the proud leader of the Tennessee Antis. Now the fight had come home to her Volunteer State. This would be Tennessee's time of trial and, she prayed, triumph. With God's help, it would meet the challenge of beating back the scourge of woman suffrage, holding fast against the feminist epidemic sweeping the nation and now threatening her home. This was her crusade and this was her moment.<br><br> She was fifty-two years old, and all of her training-college, graduate degrees, and her years as an educator-had prepared her for this mission. She knew she was doing God's will, fulfilling a sacred vow to her beloved mother, who had understood the dangers of female suffrage, how it mocked the plan of the Creator, undermined women's purity and the noble chivalry of men, and threatened the home and the family.The Bible said a woman's place was in the home, as loving wife and mother, not in the dirty realm of politics, not in the polling booth or in the jury box, where her delicate sensibilities could be assaulted, her morals sullied and even corrupted. Her men knew what was best for her, would protect and cherish her, make laws and decisions for her benefit. Pearson felt there was no need to question the wisdom of Tennessee men or Tennessee laws.<br><br> But the threat went beyond this. Woman suffrage could upend the supremacy of the white race and the southern way of life. After the brutal disruptions of the Civil War and the upheavals of Reconstruction-when black men were allowed to vote (and some were even elected to the legislature) but former Confederate soldiers were considered traitors and stripped of their voting rights-the southern states had finally achieved a degree of equilibrium, in terms of restoring racial and political relations, the Pearson family believed. Jim Crow laws kept blacks in their place. But if a federal amendment mandated suffrage for all women, that would mean black women, too. Then Washington could demand that black men be allowed to vote, and that was totally unacceptable.<br><br> Barely a week before Mother had died in the summer of 1915, in the library of their house on the Methodist Assembly grounds in Monteagle (Father was a retired Methodist minister), Amanda Pearson had grasped Josephine's hand and implored: "Daughter, when I'm gone-if the Susan B. Anthony Amendment issue reaches Tennessee-promise me, you will take up the opposition, in My Memory!" Josephine bent to kiss her mother's brow, to impress the vow upon her forehead, and answered: "Yes, God helping, I'll keep the faith, Mother!"<br><br> So when the telegram arrived late Saturday afternoon, it was with a sense of holy purpose that Josephine Pearson quickly packed her travel case, walked from her house to the Monteagle depot, and bought a one-way ticket for the late train to Nashville.<br><br> Even before Josephine made the vow to her mother, she had come to the conclusion that suffrage was a dangerous idea; she arrived at this judgment by what she considered empirical and scholarly investigation, as befitted a woman with higher education and intellectual accomplishments. Early in her career she served as a high school principal and went on to teach English and history at Nashville College for Young Ladies and Winthrop State Normal College for Women in South Carolina. In 1909, she assumed the position of dean and chair of philosophy at Christian College in Columbia, Missouri, at a time when Missourians were debating a woman suffrage measure.<br><br> She found she often fell into argument with her colleagues and students about woman suffrage and was frequently the sole naysayer at the faculty table. She began to feel isolated, shunned for her resistance against the popular political tide. She came to resent her faculty colleagues who snubbed her and used their positions to coerce their impressionable students with their terrible suffrage ideas. During semester breaks, Josephine undertook her own version of field research to determine whether women in those few western states where females already had the right to vote, such as Wyoming, were really better off for having the franchise. She collected her own data and conducted interviews and came to the conclusion that suffrage had exposed women to the filth of politics without improving their lives at all. She began to give lectures to antisuffrage audiences and found herself hailed as an Anti leader in the state.<br><br> Her academic career in Missouri was cut short in the spring of 1914 by the call to come home to care for her ailing mother, and she returned to Monteagle to nurse her mother and aged father. From her sickbed, Mother continued to write her diatribes against the evils of whiskey and suffrage, and after her death, honoring the vow, Josephine continued the work. She sat at her desk, writing deep into the night, sending her missives to the newspapers in Nashville and Memphis and Chattanooga. The publisher of the Chattanooga Times, Adolph Ochs, was especially welcoming to her antisuffrage proclamations; Ochs's editorial pages, in both his Chattanooga paper and its sister publication, The New York Times, were firmly in her Anti camp. Pearson's dedication was recognized and she was eventually tapped to become president of the Tennessee antisuffragists. And now, like the Confederate generals whose brave exploits had been extolled in her family's parlor, whose names and deeds she knew by heart, she would stand in defense of the South.</p><h2>Wolf Children: Ame &amp; Yuki</h2><p>When Hana falls in love with a young interloper she encounters in her college class, the last thing she expects to learn is that he is part wolf.

But after what seems like a mere moment of bliss to Hana, the father of her children is tragically taken from her. Life as a single mother is hard in any situation, but when your children walk a fine line between man and beast, the rules of parenting all but go out the window. With no one to turn to, how will Hana survive?</p><p>Mamoru Hosoda is an internationally acclaimed animator and director who has previously helmed such award-winning movies as <i>The Girl Who Leapt Through Time, Summer Wars</i>, <i>Wolf Children</i>, and <i>The Boy and the Beast</i>.When college student Hana begins to notice a handsome, older guy in one of her classes, she&#x2019;s drawn to him. He&#x2019;s a loner, and as they grow closer, he reveals that he is actually half wolf, the last of a line of legendary Japanese wolves long thought to be extinct. After they become lovers, Hana has a daughter named Yuki and a son named Ame&#x2014;both part wolf like their father. Hana, Yuki, and Ame must all learn to live in secret with Yuki and Ame&#x2019;s wolfish nature. Will any of them ever find peace to be who they really are? How do they balance having more than one identity? This beautifully drawn manga, based on Hosoda&#x2019;s 2012 film Wolf Children, does a lovely job of capturing the joy and heartache of the film and is a thoughtful exploration of what it means to be from multiple cultures. Hand this to fans of cute but melancholy manga series, such as Natsuki Takaya&#x2019;s Fruits Basket (2004) or Summer Wars (2013), also adapted from a Hosoda film.

Stevens, at the end of three decades of service at Darlington Hall, spending a day on a country drive, embarks as well on a journey through the past in an effort to reassure himself that he has served humanity by serving the "great gentleman," Lord Darlington. But lurking in his memory are doubts about the true nature of Lord Darlington's "greatness," and much graver doubts about the nature of his own life.</p><p>The novel&#39;s narrator, Stevens, is a perfect English butler who tries to give his narrow existence form and meaning through the self-effacing, almost mystical practice of his profession.

He lives outside Washington, D.C.</p>Americans Tuesday, October 16, 1962, 11:50 a.m. The Central Intelligence Agency&#x2019;s chief photo interpreter hovered over the president&#x2019;s shoulder. Arthur Lundahl held a pointer in his hand, ready to reveal a secret that would bring the world to the edge of nuclear war. The secret was buried in three black-and-white photographs pasted to briefing boards hidden in a large black case. The photographs had been shot from directly overhead, evidently from a considerable distance, with the aid of a very powerful zoom lens. On superficial inspection, the grainy images of fields, forests, and winding country roads seemed innocuous, almost bucolic. One of the fields contained tubelike objects, others oval-shaped white dots neatly lined up next to one another. John F. Kennedy would later remark that the site could be mistaken for &#x201c;a football field.&#x201d; After examining the photographs earlier that morning, his brother Bobby had been unable to make out anything more than &#x201c;the clearing of a field for a farm or the basement of a house.&#x201d; To help the president understand the significance of the photos, Lundahl had labeled them with arrows pointing to the dots and blotches, along with captions reading &#x201c;ERECTOR LAUNCHER EQUIPMENT,&#x201d; &#x201c;MISSILE TRAILERS,&#x201d; and &#x201c;TENT AREAS.&#x201d; He was about to display the briefing boards when there was a commotion outside the door. A four-year-old girl burst into one of the most heavily guarded rooms in the White House. The heads of the fourteen most powerful men in the United States swiveled to the doorway as Caroline Kennedy ran toward her father, babbling excitedly: &#x201c;Daddy, daddy, they won&#x2019;t let my friend in.&#x201d; The somber-looking men in dark suits were used to such intrusions. Their frowns dissolved into smiles as the president got up from his leather-upholstered seat and led his daughter back toward the door of the Cabinet Room. &#x201c;Caroline, have you been eating candy?&#x201d; No reply. The president smiled. &#x201c;Answer me. Yes, no, or maybe.&#x201d; Father and daughter disappeared for a few seconds, his arm draped around her shoulders. When Kennedy returned, his expression had again become grave. He took his place at the center of the long table beneath the presidential seal, his back to the Rose Garden. He was flanked on either side by his secretary of state and secretary of defense. Facing him across the table were his brother, his vice president, and his national security adviser. Behind them stood a small bronze bust of Abraham Lincoln, flanked by some model sailing ships. Above the fireplace to the right was the celebrated Gilbert Stuart portrait of a powdered and bewigged George Washington. The thirty-fifth president of the United States called the meeting to order. Kennedy seemed preternaturally calm to the other men in the room as he listened to the evidence of Kremlin duplicity. In secrecy, while insisting they would never contemplate such a thing, the Soviet leaders had installed surface-to-surface nuclear missiles on Cuba, less than a hundred miles from American shores. According to the CIA, the missiles had a range of 1,174 miles and were capable of hitting much of the eastern seaboard. Once armed and ready to fire, they could explode over Washington in thirteen minutes, turning the capital into a scorched wasteland. Lundahl took the briefing boards out of his bag and laid them on the table. He used his pointer to direct the president&#x2019;s attention to a canvas-covered missile trailer next to a launcher erector. Seven more missile trailers were parked in a nearby field. &#x201c;How do you know this is a medium-range ballistic missile?&#x201d; asked the president. His voice was clipped and tense, betraying a boiling anger beneath the calm. &#x201c;The length, sir.&#x201d; &#x201c;The what? The length?&#x201d; &#x201c;The length of it, yes.&#x201d; CIA experts had spent the last thirty-six hours poring over thousands of reconnaissance photographs of the hills and valleys of western Cuba. They had discovered telltale cables connecting one of the tubelike objects to the nearby oval-shaped splotch, and had used a revolutionary new computer device that filled up half a room&#x2014;the Mann Model 621 comparator&#x2014;to measure its length. The tubes turned out to be sixty-seven feet long. Missiles of identical length had been photographed at military parades in Red Square in Moscow. The president asked the obvious question: when would the missiles be ready to fire? The experts were unsure. That would depend on how soon the missiles could be mated with their nuclear warheads. Once mated, they could be fired in a couple of hours. So far, there was no evidence to suggest that the Soviets had moved the warheads to the missile sites. If the warheads were present, one would expect to see some kind of secure storage facility at the missile sites, but nothing was visible.&#x201c;There is <i>some</i> reason to believe the warheads aren&#x2019;t present and hence they are <i>not </i>ready to fire,&#x201d; said Defense Secretary Robert S. McNamara. The computerlike brain of the former head of the Ford Motor Company clicked away furiously, calculating the chances of a surprise attack. He believed the president still had some time. The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff disagreed. General Maxwell Taylor had parachuted into Normandy during World War II, and had commanded Allied forces in Berlin and Korea. It fell to him to point out the risks of delay. The Soviets could be in a position to fire their missiles &#x201c;very quickly.&#x201d; Most of the infrastructure was already in place. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not a question of waiting for extensive concrete pads and that sort of thing.&#x201d; The president&#x2019;s advisers were already dividing into doves and hawks. Kennedy had received an initial intelligence briefing earlier that morning. His national security adviser, McGeorge Bundy, had knocked on the door of his bedroom, on the second floor of the White House, shortly after 8:00 a.m. The president was propped up in bed, in pajamas and dressing gown, reading the morning newspapers. As often happened, he was annoyed by a page-one headline in <i>The New York Times</i>. On this particular morning, his exasperation was directed at his predecessor, Dwight D. Eisenhower, who had broken the unwritten convention of former presidents refraining from publicly criticizing the current occupant of the Oval Office. EISENHOWER CALLS PRESIDENT WEAK ON FOREIGN POLICY &#x2014; Denounces &#x201c;Dreary Record,&#x201d; Challenging&nbsp; Statements by Kennedy on Achievements &#x2014; HE SEES SETBACK TO U.S. As Bundy described the latest U-2 mission over Cuba, Kennedy&#x2019;s irritation with Ike was replaced by a burning anger toward his Cold War nemesis. Over the past two years, he and Nikita Khrushchev had been engaged in a very public game of nuclear oneupmanship. But Kennedy thought he had an understanding with the mercurial Soviet premier. Khrushchev had sent word through intermediaries that he would do nothing to embarrass the U.S. president politically before the midterm congressional elections, which were exactly three weeks away. News that the Soviets were constructing missile bases on Cuba could hardly have come at a worse time. During the 1960 presidential election, Kennedy had used Cuba as a stick to beat the Republicans, accusing the Eisenhower government of doing nothing to prevent Fidel Castro from transforming the island into &#x201c;a hostile and militant Communist satellite.&#x201d; Now that the Democrats were in power, the political roles were reversed. Republican politicians were seizing on reports of a Soviet military buildup on Cuba to denounce Kennedy for weakness and fecklessness. Just two days earlier, Kennedy had sent Bundy out on nationwide television to knock down a claim by the Republican senator from New York, Kenneth B. Keating, that the Soviets would soon be able &#x201c;to hurl rockets into the American heartland&#x201d; from their Caribbean outpost.Kennedy&#x2019;s immediate reaction on learning from Bundy that Khrushchev had double-crossed him was to sputter, &#x201c;He can&#x2019;t do this to me.&#x201d; An hour later, he walked into the office of his appointments secretary, Kenny O&#x2019;Donnell, and announced glumly, &#x201c;Ken Keating will probably be the next president of the United States.&#x201d; Determined to keep the information secret as long as possible, Kennedy decided to stick to his regular schedule, acting as if nothing was amiss. He showed off Caroline&#x2019;s pony Macaroni to the family of a returning astronaut, chatted amiably for half an hour with a Democratic congressman, and presided over a conference on mental retardation. It was not until nearly noon that he managed to break away from his ceremonial duties and meet with his top foreign policy advisers. Kennedy conceded that he was mystified by Khrushchev. Alternately ingratiating and boorish, friendly and intimidating, the metalworker turned superpower leader was unlike any other politician he had ever encountered. Their single summit meeting&#x2014;in Vienna, in June 1961&#x2014;had been a brutal experience for Kennedy. Khrushchev had treated him like a little boy, lecturing him on American misdeeds, threatening to take over West Berlin, and boasting about the inevitable triumph of communism. Most shocking of all, Khrushchev did not seem to share his alarm about the risks of nuclear war, and how it could be triggered by miscalculations on either side. He spoke about nuclear weapons in a casual, offhand kind of way, as simply one more element in the superpower competition. If the United States wants war, he blustered, &#x201c;let it begin now.&#x201d; &#x201c;Roughest thing in my life,&#x201d; Kennedy had told James Reston of <i>The New York Times</i>, after it was all over. &#x201c;He just beat the hell out of me.&#x201d;&nbsp; Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson was contemptuous of his boss&#x2019;s performance. &#x201c;Khrushchev scared the poor little fellow dead,&#x201d; he told his cronies. British prime minister Harold Macmillan, who met with Kennedy shortly after he left Vienna, was only slightly more sympathetic. He thought that the president had been &#x201c;completely overwhelmed by the ruthlessness and barbarity of the Russian Chairman.&#x201d; For the first time in his life Kennedy had met a man &#x201c;who was impervious to his charm,&#x201d; Macmillan noted later. &#x201c;It reminded me in a way of Lord Halifax or Neville Chamberlain trying to hold a conversation with Herr Hitler.&#x201d; Part of the problem lay in Kennedy&#x2019;s own miscalculations as president. The biggest mistake of all was the Bay of Pigs. In April 1961, four months after taking office, he had authorized an invasion of Cuba by fifteen hundred CIA-trained Cuban exiles. But the operation was disastrously planned and executed. Castro mounted a vigorous counterattack, trapping the exiles in an isolated beachhead. Anxious to conceal official American involvement as much as possible, Kennedy refused to order U.S. ships and planes stationed just offshore to come to the rescue of the outnumbered invaders, most of whom ended up in Castro&#x2019;s jails. As Kennedy later confessed to Reston, his superpower rival had no doubt concluded that &#x201c;I&#x2019;m inexperienced. Probably thinks I&#x2019;m stupid. Maybe most important, he thinks that I had no guts.&#x201d; The perception of an&nbsp; inexperienced leader with no guts was one that he had been struggling to reverse ever since. The news from Cuba reinforced Kennedy&#x2019;s impression of Khrushchev as a &#x201c;fucking liar.&#x201d; He complained to his brother that the Soviet leader had behaved like &#x201c;an immoral gangster . . . not as a statesman, not as a person with a sense of responsibility.&#x201d; The question was how to respond. They would definitely step up U-2 reconnaissance of the island. Military options ranged from an air strike targeted on the missile sites alone to an all-out invasion. General Taylor warned that it would probably be impossible to destroy all the missiles in a single strike. &#x201c;It&#x2019;ll never be a hundred per cent, Mr. President.&#x201d; Any military action was likely to escalate quickly to an invasion. The invasion plan called for as many as a hundred and fifty thousand men to land in Cuba a week after the initial air strikes. In the meantime, the Soviets might be able to launch one or two nuclear missiles against the United States. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re certainly going to do [option] number one,&#x201d; Kennedy told his aides grimly, referring to the air strike. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re going to take out those missiles.&#x201d; Tuesday, October 16, 2:30 p.m.&nbsp; Robert Kennedy still had an angry glint in his eye later that afternoon when he met the men in charge of America&#x2019;s secret war against Fidel Castro in his cavernous Justice Department office. He was determined to make clear the president&#x2019;s &#x201c;dissatisfaction&#x201d; with Operation Mongoose, which had been under way for a year, achieving virtually nothing. Countless acts of sabotage had been planned, but none had been carried out successfully. Fidel and his bearded revolutionaries were still in power, inflicting daily humiliations on the United States. Officials from the CIA, the Pentagon, and the State Department were arrayed in a semicircle in front of the attorney general. A fresh assortment of his children&#x2019;s watercolors decorated the walls, along with standard-issue government art. One of the documents on the untidy, paper-littered desk was a two-page memorandum captioned &#x201c;secret mongoose&#x201d; with the latest ideas for fomenting an insurrection inside Cuba. It had been put together by the CIA in response to prodding from the Kennedy brothers to be much more &#x201c;aggressive.&#x201d; RFK nodded approvingly as he glanced through the list: �&nbsp;Demolition of a railroad bridge in Pinar del R�o province; �&nbsp;Grenade attack on the Chinese Communist embassy in Havana; �&nbsp;Mine the approaches to major Cuban harbors; �&nbsp;Set an oil tanker afire outside Havana or Matanzas; �&nbsp;Incendiary attacks against oil refineries in Havana and Santiago. The attorney general title masked Bobby&#x2019;s true role in government, which was closer to that of deputy president. His extracurricular responsibilities included heading a secret committee known as the Special Group (Augmented), whose goal was to &#x201c;get rid of&#x201d; Castro and &#x201c;liberate&#x201d; Cuba from Communist domination. The addition of the president&#x2019;s brother to the group&#x2014;signified by the cryptic word &#x201c;Augmented&#x201d;&#x2014;was a way of emphasizing its importance to the rest of the bureaucracy. Soon after taking personal control of Operation Mongoose in November 1961, Bobby had decreed that &#x201c;the Cuban problem carries top priority in the U.S. government. No time, money, effort, or manpower is to be spared.&#x201d; By coincidence, he had arranged a long-scheduled review of covert action plans against Cuba the very day that Soviet missiles were discovered on the island. Bobby chose his words carefully as he addressed the Special Group. Half the officials in the room were unaware of the latest developments, and the president had stressed the need for total secrecy. But it was difficult for him to conceal his anger as he talked about &#x201c;the change in atmosphere in the United States government during the last twenty-four hours.&#x201d; Frustrated by the lack of &#x201c;push&#x201d; in getting on with acts of sabotage, he announced that he planned to devote &#x201c;more personal attention&#x201d; to Mongoose. To accomplish this, he would meet with the Mongoose operational team every morning at 0930 until further notice. For Bobby, the appearance of Soviet missiles in the western hemisphere was not simply a political affront; it was a personal affront. He was the emotional member of the family, as rough and intense as his brother was smooth and calm. JFK had been humiliated once again by Castro and Khrushchev, and RFK was determined to redress the insult. He was extraordinarily competitive&#x2014;even by the intensely competitive standards of the Kennedy clan&#x2014;and the longest to nurse a grudge. &#x201c;Everybody in my family forgives,&#x201d; the family patriarch, Joseph Kennedy, Sr., had once remarked. &#x201c;Except Bobby.&#x201d;</p><h2>Hiking Through: One Man&#39;s Journey to Peace and Freedom on the Appalachian Trail</h2><p>After Paul Stutzman lost his wife to breast cancer, he sensed a tug on his heart--the call to a challenge, the call to pursue a dream.

Amsterdam is the font of liberalism, in both its senses. Tolerance for free thinking and free love make it a place where, in the words of one of its mayors, "craziness is a value." But the city also fostered the deeper meaning of liberalism, one that profoundly influenced America: political and economic freedom. Amsterdam was home not only to religious dissidents and radical thinkers but to the world's first great global corporation.<br><br> In this effortlessly erudite account, Russell Shorto traces the idiosyncratic evolution of Amsterdam, showing how such disparate elements as herring anatomy, naked Anabaptists parading through the streets, and an intimate gathering in a sixteenth-century wine-tasting room had a profound effect on Dutch-and world-history. Weaving in his own experiences of his adopted home, Shorto provides an ever-surprising, intellectually engaging story of Amsterdam.</p><p>Russell Shorto is the author of five books and is a contributing writer at the <i>The New York Times Magazine</i>. His books have been published in fourteen languages and have won numerous awards. From 2008 to 2013, he was the director of the John Adams Institute in Amsterdam.CHAPTER 1<br><br>A Bicycle Trip<br><br>A day in Amsterdam begins with me leaving my apartment with my toddler son in my arms, strapping him into his seat between the handlebars of my bicycle, working his blocky little sneakered feet into the footpads, then setting off through the quiet, generally breezy streets of our neighborhood, which is called Oud Zuid: Old South. You could look at the work of any Dutch master for an idea of the morning light we cycle through. There is a white cleanness to it, a rinsed quality. It's a sober light, without, for example, any of the orange particulate glow you get from the Mediterranean sun. The houses of the neighborhood are three- or four-story brick buildings, all constructed in the first two decades of the twentieth century, when what was then a vigorously working-class city, one that still smelled of herring and roasting coffee beans, expanded rapidly around its central core of canals.<br><br>We cycle past street-level apartments, some of which, following a Dutch tradition that I like to think has to do with an ingrained commitment to openness, feature a central uncurtained window that puts the living room on public display, as if the family who lives there thinks its life is worthy of a museum. For a while I didn't understand why, when we reach the part of the route that has us riding alongside a canal, my son would break out in a series of high screeches. Then I realized Anthony was imitating the gulls that squeal as they do their crazy arcs and dives above the water.<br><br>We pass a few businesses. The bakery is usually scenting the morning air with cinnamon as we ride by. The display windows of the corner bicycle shop exhibit sturdy, gleaming new models, lately in an array of pastel tones, by Gazelle and Batavus, factories that have been turning out Dutch bicycles for a century. An open door to the right of the windows leads down to the basement, and the repair shop, whose interior I know too well. The grooves in the concrete at both sides of the stairway leading below are meant for bicycle tires.<br><br>Once in a while I will vary the route and turn down along the Hobbemakade, where on our right is a slightly forlorn-looking stretch of canal, with weeds growing up through the quayside where rickety houseboats are moored, and on the left are the remnants of one of the smallest and least noticeable of the city's several red light districts. De Wallen--Amsterdam's central red light district--is a sort of alternate-universe Disneyland, noisy and with a certain ragged cheer, visited not only by drunken male tourists but also by couples strolling arm in arm and even families. Here, by contrast, there are only three or four of the display windows that the city's licensed prostitutes sit in to exhibit themselves, in the midst of what is otherwise a residential street. I never get how customers would know to find them. Nevertheless, even in the morning there is often at least one woman on duty, wearing a swimsuit, sitting on a stool, smoking, or listlessly punching the keys of a cell phone. Sometimes she will wave at Anthony and give him a little smile. The other window might be empty save for a stool with a towel folded on the seat that is crumpled in a way that looks like it has been sat on. Such details--the crumpled towel, the bored look of the woman facing a long day of staring into the street, punctuated by short intervals of sex with strangers--bring the city's infamous tolerance of vice out of the realms of sensationalism and idealism and into the realm of the deeply mundane. As with any other place, living here for a time causes the exotic to collapse under the weight of ordinariness. Two doors down is another storefront business, an advertising agency whose name--Strangelove--you might think is intended as a wry commentary on the neighbors, but I would bet not. I'll bet they don't even notice.<br><br>Amsterdam School is the name given to the style of architecture that was pioneered in my neighborhood as it was coming into being. The style has a formal aesthetic, which has its technical descriptors and philosophical (socialist) underpinnings, but to me it simply embodies a reasonably pleasant combination of whimsy and stolidness. Brick (what could be more stolid?) is the medium, yet there is an infinity of playful variations: rounded turretlike corners, embedded deco-ish sculptures that seem to mock the hardness of the material (a girl surrounded by rabbits, a baby holding up a doorway), block-long apartment buildings that could have had an ocean liner as their inspiration, or a wedding cake.<br><br>The neighborhood is no more than five minutes by bike from the canal belt and the storied seventeenth-century heart of Amsterdam, but when developers were laying it out a hundred years ago they must have felt a need to connect the new area to the city's history. If Rembrandt visited the immediate area around my home he might feel some familiarity, for even though this was swamp and fields in his time the streets bear the names of many of the artists whom he groomed in his workshop or competed with for commissions: Frans van Mieris, who wrought exquisite small portraits of the wealthy class; Nicolaas Maes, who often painted ordinary people at prayer and at meals and gave the same loving attention to a glistening loaf of bread or an earthen pitcher on a table as he did to the faces of his subjects; Philips Wouwerman, who specialized in hunting scenes and was known to paint a mean horse.<br><br>At the time my neighborhood came into being, all of those were figures of the grand past, so that the names Nicolaas Maesstraat and Frans van Mierisstraat instantly gave the new neighborhood some of the luster of Amsterdam's age of glory, when it was--briefly and improbably--the greatest city in the world. To this day the houses on those streets have dignified presence. But as you go farther away from the center, as we do on our morning trip, the houses get plainer. It seems the city fathers of a century ago did not want to dilute the grandeur of the golden age by spreading its names too far. On the other hand, in 1905, right at the time that the more distant part of the neighborhood was being laid out, the nearby Stedelijk Museum, the city's modern art museum, mounted the first exhibition in the country devoted to Vincent van Gogh. The Dutch artist had died only fifteen years before; his home country had done its best to ignore him, but it was now obvious that they would have to pay attention. Yet at the same time, his name didn't carry bourgeois heft--and who knew if those thick swirls of bright color would withstand the test of time? As a result of what I imagine were considerations such as these, Vincent van Goghstraat--the only street in the area whose name is instantly, globally recognizable today--is among the humblest: a single block of monotone dwellings.<br><br>That street also signals the end of our little journey. As Anthony and I pass it, I hop off the bicycle, unstrap him, and set him on the sidewalk. While I ring the doorbell, he opens the mailbox flap, which is on his level, and hollers into it. The door is opened by a Moroccan woman in her thirties, wearing a head scarf, floor-length robe, and sandals. She has a kind face and smiles at Anthony as she tells him he's grown over the weekend: "Nou, wat een grote jongen ben je!" He plays a game, trying to scramble up the stairs to the next floor instead of going into her apartment. Iman and her husband have lived in Amsterdam for ten years. They have two young daughters. Her husband drives a city bus; she is a licensed gastouder: literally, "guest parent," what in the United States would be called a day care provider. Her four-year-old, Marwa, emerges from behind her, with a tangle of curls and big deep eyes, and says hello over and over, very loudly. Then she tells me Anthony is ugly. Then she gives him a hug and hauls him into the apartment.<br><br>Iman and I chat for a few minutes. Some weeks before she asked if Anthony's mother and I would sign an immigration document in support of her sister, who wanted to come to Amsterdam to visit. I was confused at first: I thought one was required to get such statements of support for people who intended to emigrate, not who merely wanted to visit family. I subsequently learned that it was now necessary in the Netherlands for people from certain countries (read poor countries--or, to be more precise, Muslim countries) to file extensive applications, including having residents vouch for them, even if all they wanted to do was see the canals and tulips. We signed the form. Then a few weeks later Iman said her sister's application had been denied. The reason given: she was "onbetrouwbaar"-untrustworthy. When Iman asked, through an immigration lawyer, for clarification, she was told that because of "ties" in the country it was feared that her sister might stay in the Netherlands. Iman was confused by this. She and her husband were legal residents of the Netherlands. They paid taxes. The family spoke Dutch at home. They were, as they say, playing by the rules. Yet their legal residence itself was deemed a reason for untrustworthiness. Much later, the decision was reversed, and Iman's sister was allowed to visit, but such is a conundrum of our era: a city famed historically for championing the notion of tolerance now seemed to be charting odd new frontiers of intolerance.<br><br>Once a week, after I've left Anthony in Iman's care, I don't return directly home but spend the morning exploring another, quite different frontier of intolerance. Taking another route, I pull up at a corner of the Beethovenstraat (now having reentered the tonier part of the district, whose precincts are suited to grand names--nearby are Rubenstraat and Bachstraat), peruse the street corner florist's kiosk, buy a bunch of variegated tulips or mauve roses, and ring a doorbell a few steps away. Upstairs, I am met by an elderly woman with short steel-gray hair, a sharply angled jawline, and darting, birdlike eyes. Her name is Frieda Menco. We exchange the standard Dutch greeting of three kisses, I hand the flowers to her, she protests mildly that I shouldn't have, then we enter her apartment. The living and dining rooms are wide, very bright, and sparsely filled with modernist furniture. A spread is laid out on the coffee table: cookies, chocolate, a pot of coffee and two cups, a jug of water, a vase of flowers.<br><br>We sit. I turn on my recorder. We exchange small talk. Then she turns her face toward the watery sunlight pouring in through the windows and says, "Now, where was I?"<br><br>Someone outside is shouting--no, a lot of people, confused voices. The train lurches suddenly; the packed bodies sway; people scream. Frieda is sixteen and for two days and nights has sat scrunched on the lap of a middle-aged man whom she doesn't know. The cattle car is so crammed with people that the atmosphere would seem to be one of horror, but instead the press of inexorable power brings on a wave of colossal deadness. The air is clotted with the reek of their waste--a barrel in the corner has been the communal open toilet. It sits perversely high, so in order to relieve herself she not only has to endure the public nature of a private act but must balance herself on its rim and try not to knock it over. There are no windows in the car, and when the door is slid shut there is no virtually no light; the air is dark and stifling as death. Occasionally she catches a glimpse of her parents where they sit wedged on the other side of the car--their eyes frightened but still holding the hard, almost uncrushable nugget of hope in them. She is their only child.<br><br>Finally, she is outside, standing on the ground. More shouts--real chaos in the distance. And there--a gallows, a human body, hanging, swaying in space. People over there are running now, screaming. Here, they are being jostled into lines. Now some are pushing into them--they are Jews like them but who know the routine, everyone wearing blue-and-white-striped prison uniforms--whispering hard into their faces: If you have anything of value, give it to me, because they will take it from you. Some of the newcomers hand over their jewelry; she gives nothing because she has nothing. They are formed into four lines: two of women and girls, two of men and boys. She and her mother are in one line, to the far right, then comes the other female line--though she doesn't know it yet, this second line, holding people who were quickly deemed not fit for work, is headed directly into the gas chamber--and she spots her father in the third line. Soldiers and dogs keep people in place: those uniforms, the Stahlhelm, the helmet with its infamously and menacingly scooped curve. But no, these things didn't register that way yet, didn't have the heavy meaning they would take on.<br><br>A grim geometry problem is on display, taunting her to find a solution: as the people lurch forward, the space between where her father stands in his line and where she and her mother are in their line grows wider.<br><br>Then, improbably, out of character, she sees her father seem to calculate, reach a rash decision. He has lunged--he is moving across that open space, obliterating that vacuum, passing through the second line of women that stands between his line and hers, defying the gray-uniformed soldiers with their helmets and guns. He is here, breathing, his face--a soft, round, gentle face--close to her. His is an artistic soul, bent by necessity toward commerce. Joel Brommet is a professional window dresser, who also gives correspondence courses in graphic design. Frieda is his joy. She helps him with his work, cranks the mimeograph machine that occupies a corner of their Amsterdam living room, running off the inky-smelling sheets, each with a carefully typed lesson, each beginning, "Worthy student," folds the packets, and stuffs them into brown envelopes to be sent to towns and villages around the country, to young people who hope to escape farming or fishing for a life with a touch more glamour. She would sometimes make trips with her father to stores to observe his latest work. He showed her how he crafted every detail of a window display: the price tags, the signs ("Speciale prijs! 13 ct."), mannequins posed just so. Frieda's earliest memory is of him. She is maybe three years old, happy and sleepy in her bed in their comfortable middle-class apartment. "Will you catch the moon for me, and put it on the cupboard?" She still remembers that cupboard and what a nice ornament she thought the silver disc of the moon would make sitting on top. He answers: "If you sleep like a sweet little girl, I'll fetch a long ladder and get the moon for you."</p><h2>Immi&#39;s Gift</h2><p>Two children half a world away from each other are connected in an unexpected way.<br>Way, way up north in a snow-covered world, a young girl is surprised when, instead of a fish on the end of her fishing line, there is a small, brightly painted wooden bird. Day after day her fishing pole brings up more colorful surprises. When visiting the fishing hole for the last time, she drops a little wooden bear into the water. Far away, a young boy walks along a beach in the hot, hot sun. He throws a colorful object into the water. Then something catches his eye. A small wooden bear washed up on the beach.<br>Karin Littlewood has crafted a simple, affecting story of how individuals around the world connect and enrich each other&#x2019;s lives.

Littlewood lives in England.K-Gr 2&#x2013;When Immi, an Inuit child, goes ice fishing, she is surrounded by a world of white. Hoping to catch just one more fish, instead she pulls up a brightly colored wooden bird, its vivid appearance in sharp contrast to the ice and snow swirling around her. She adds it to her necklace, next to a small white bear. On the days that follow, she fishes out other brightly colored objects and hangs them in her igloo until it is awash in color. Various polar animals are attracted, and Immi snuggles with them while they share stories of faraway lands. When the snow begins to melt, Immi departs, but before she goes she throws her small white bear into the ice-fishing hole. It is later retrieved from tropical waters by the boy who has been tossing his brightly colored creatures into the waves. The painterly illustrations done in colored pencil, watercolor, and gouache capture Immi's frozen world, and her little flight of fancy seems logical escapism for anyone living even briefly in such isolated and lonely circumstances. This might be a jumping-off point to discuss how the imagination can provide relief and comfort, but it's an additional purchase.<i>Grace Oliff, Ann Blanche Smith School, Hillsdale, NJ</i><br>� Copyright 2010.

But she also brings a critical perspective and a creative vision, rooted in her extensive experience as an organizer and organic intellectual and in her fierce and fearless commitment to truth. This is an inspiring, powerful, but difficult book, because she confronts our movements, our people, our closeted silences, toxic masculinity, patriarchal violence, romantic and selective historical memory, and our future head-on, through a radical Black queer feminist lens. Welcome to the Black radical tradition.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Robin D. G. Kelley, author of <i>Freedom Dreams: The Black Radical Imagination</i><br><br>&#x201c;This brilliant and powerful book is a clarion call to keep alive the Black radical tradition in these reactionary times. Charlene A. Carruthers is an exemplary organic intellectual rooted in the struggles of black poor and working people, especially LGBTQ youth, with a subtle analysis and an international vision for freedom. She stands in the great lineage of Harriet Tubman, Ida B. Wells-Barnett, and Marsha P. Johnson&#x2014;grand fighters and great lovers of everyday black people and oppressed folk everywhere!&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Dr. Cornel West<br><br>&#x201c;Charlene Carruthers is a powerful organizer, radical thinker, paradigm-shifter, and one of the most influential political voices of her generation. Anyone seriously interested in the struggle for Black liberation in this country needs to listen carefully to what she has to say.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Barbara Ransby, author of <i>Ella Baker and the Black Freedom Movement</i> and <i>Making All Black Lives Matter</i><br><br>&#x201c;Leadership is the ability to not only make your own way but to return to give others a roadmap that they, too, can follow. This is what Charlene Carruthers does with <i>Unapologetic</i>. She offers us a guide to getting free with incisive prose, years of grassroots organizing experience, and a deeply intersectional lens. She doesn&#x2019;t forget any of us, and reminds us that bringing all of ourselves and our people with us is the only way any of us will get free.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Janet Mock, author of <i>Redefining Realness</i> and <i>Surpassing Certainty</i><br><br>&#x201c;<i>Unapologetic</i> serves as our marching orders. Charlene gives us not just a manual but a prayer, an intention, a critical path forward, and a deep analysis on where we&#x2019;ve been. She educates us about community violence and state violence, and provides the clarity to show why Black liberation is crucial for us all.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Patrisse Khan Cullors, coauthor of <i>When They Call You a Terrorist: A Black Lives Matter Memoir</i><br><br>&#x201c;<i>Unapologetic</i> is a beautiful, insightful, and powerful analysis of this moment, Black movements, and Black radical futures. Both Charlene Carruthers&#x2019;s work as an organizer and organic intellectual and her writing in <i>Unapologetic</i> embody the Black radical tradition and the best of Black feminism today. Carruthers confronts the difficulties of organizing in this era, while also detailing the possibilities of collective struggle. She helps us understand the contours of a Black queer feminist future and what we all must do to get there. This is a must-read for anyone committed to freedom and liberation.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Cathy J. Cohen, <i>Democracy Remixed: Black Youth and the Future of American Politics</i><br><br>&#x201c;With this clear call to action, Charlene Carruthers&#x2019;s <i>Unapologetic</i> is a desperately needed analysis of the past, the present, and where we must head into the future. It&#x2019;s a must-read for everyone who wants deeper, honest insight into the struggles happening in our country right now, clarifying why stopping anti-Black racism, homophobia, and sexism and building transformative power intersectionally are urgent necessities for our families, communities, and the nation.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Kristin Rowe-Finkbeiner, author, executive director and cofounder of MomsRising.org<br><br>&#x201c;<i>Unapologetic</i> is as much a narrative about collective youth-driven organizing by those affiliated with the current Movement for Black Lives as it is a story about how one young Black woman from the South Side of Chicago found herself leading one of the most consequential formations of the past decade. The book offers practical tips for organizers along with a critical analysis of the promise and pitfalls of this current iteration of the Black radical tradition. As an organizer, I found myself nodding along as I read this terrific book while taking notes to improve my own practice.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Mariame Kaba, founder of Project NIA and cofounder of Survived &amp; Punished<br><br>&#x201c;Charlene Carruthers speaks with the authenticity and authority of an organizer from the front lines of struggle. Cut from the cloth of the South Side of Chicago, Carruthers offers a critical perspective into the experience of organizing and building a movement from the inside. As an organizer, Charlene provides rare insight into the strategies, tactics, and raging debates that animate the phenomenon of Black Lives Matter. If you want to understand this movement and the people whose hands are dirty from working with the grassroots, then you need this book.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor, author of <i>From #BlackLivesMatter to Black Liberation</i></p><h2>Dictionary of American Hand Tools: A Pictorial Synopsis (Schiffer Book for Collectors)</h2><p>Here is the greatest assembly of hand tools ever assembled.

However, I felt that I could not speak of it openly until the &#34;time was right,&#34; and that time is now! In the years that followed, I had angelic encounters that are also recounted in these pages.The time I spent in the presence of Jesus profoundly changed me! During this time, Jesus promised that the story of His visitation and the teaching He gave during my 45-minutes with Him has the capacity to radically change YOU too.

They will even gather creatures such as butterflies and bugs with interest and delight.</p><p>What if the study of grammar could harness a child's natural curiosity? What if it could be a source of delight to children? The Well-Ordered Language curriculum presents the study of language in a way that appeals to a child's inborn curiosity and desire to collect, gather, and order. The curriculum presents grammar in a clear, orderly way, while simultaneously seeking to cultivate a child s wonder of language by presenting instruction in the context of narrative and language, attractive illustrations, and samples taken from classic children's literature and poetry.</p><p>Students will not merely be able to identify the parts of a sentence, but also will understand how words behave in a sentence. As students see the components of language (the parts of speech) unfold before them throughout the Well-Ordered Language series, they will be able to apply their knowledge, gathering and arranging words to express their thoughts clearly and accurately.</p><p>The curriculum is designed for teachers and students to actively engage with each other and with the grammatical concepts in each lesson, using language skills reading, writing, speaking, and listening along with physical movement, songs, and chants. Through Well-Ordered Language's unique, creative, and orderly method of analyzing the grammatical functions of the parts of speech, students will find the mastery of grammar achievable, meaningful, and delightful.</p><p>Well-Ordered Language Level 1B (WOL 1B) will introduce students to:<br>-Object pronouns<br>-Prepositional phrases adverbial<br>-Introductory prepositional phrases<br>-Compound subjects<br>-Compound verbs<br>-Compound direct objects</p></p><p></p><h2>Education: Does God Have an Opinion?</h2><p><p>Since the beginning of the 20th century, the vast majority of Christians have embraced the idea that it is a proper role and function of the civil government to control and guide the education of children. Most Christians believe God doesn't care, one way or the other, how our children are schooled or what methods are employed. This book will use Scripture to prove otherwise. What you read in this book will radically challenge your assumptions and preconceived ideas.</p> <ul> <li>Discover the true purpose of an education and how this affects and influences students </li><li>Explore a truly Biblical philosophy of education and how it compares to traditional schooling</li> <li>Learn to apply a Biblical worldview strategically and systematically to core subjects of education</li> </ul> <p>There is almost no topic that is as relevant to the future of Christianity or as controversial as the education of children. Students in school classrooms spend thousands of hours being instructed by people who are not their parents. There is almost no way to calculate what a powerful force this is for influence.</p> <p>From rules to help students reason to information that will help you be a more effective teacher, this book shows the vital importance of "why" in asking students to learn the "what" and "how" of any subject. The future of your child's education and, therefore, his or her life is ultimately in your hands as a parent. Open your mind and your heart to God's Word and His truth. Much is at stake. Ask Him to give you discernment to help you understand how He sees the issue of education.</p></p><p><p>Israel Wayne is an author and conference speaker who has a passion for defending the Christian faith and promoting a Biblical worldview.

Scientific Facts</h2><p><p><strong>WANT ACCESS TO SOLID SCIENTIFIC FACTS REFUTING THE INCESSANT MEDIA HYPE SURROUNDING CLIMATE CHANGE? THEN THE MYTHOLOGY OF GLOBAL WARMING IS FOR YOU!</strong></p><p>The Mythology of Global Warming is intended to provide the general public with a broad spectrum of scientific and factual information on the subject of Climate Change. This book debunks the incessant, emotional, and largely unsubstantiated claims made by the progressive media and climate scientists that industrial societies such as the United States are destroying our planet due to the use of fossil fuels. What causes global warming? What is a greenhouse gas? What impact do carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels actually have on the Earth&#x2019;s climate relative to naturally occurring phenomena? Is all ice on Earth really melting, and are sea levels rising at a catastrophic rate? Are all forms of extreme weather, including hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, and droughts increasing dramatically? Are polar bears and other life forms being pushed to the brink of extinction? Will all of this mayhem cease if fossil fuels are replaced by &#x2018;green&#x2019; renewable energy sources? Answers to these questions clearly show that hard facts do not support <em>any</em> of the above dire predictions.</p><p>The science of global warming is indeed &#x2018;settled&#x2019;; Global Warming is a myth.</p><p>&#x201c;...Global warming proponents can&#x2019;t prove that man is destroying the planet due to global warming, but Dr. Bunker can prove that we are not.

There are many Catholics who are not familiar with having a plan of life that includes these basic elements. Many Catholics would like to grow spiritually, but don&#39;t know where to start and welcome this kind of practical, doable approach.</p><p>This book has its immediate origins in my own experience as a parish priest in inner city parishes in southeastern Massachusetts where I found that among those who had a great hunger for God, many had attended only a few years of catechetical classes and had received very little concrete guidance on how to grow in the love of God eachday.&nbsp;Priests go to seminary for 4-8 years, religious go through postulancy, novitiate and several years of initial formation before they make final vows, but many lay people never have the opportunity to receive a systematic training in living the Christian life in its depth.&nbsp;It was into that breach that I tried to jump as a pastor.&nbsp;As I spoke to children on Sunday mornings for 15 minutes between Masses, I began to sketch out the elements of a Catholic plan of life.&nbsp;If they, I asked, wanted to be a future superstar quarterback -- like Tom Brady, leader of the New England Patriots and athletic hero to many of them -- what would they need to be doing now? Pigging out on Doritos or eating healthy? Practicing football or playing cards? Listening to coaches or ignoring their advice? Getting into the paper in the sports section or crime log? Doing well in school so that they could master a complicated playbook or goofing off?&nbsp;They saw quickly the lesson that becoming a Hall of Fame quarterback doesn't happen by chance, or simply because of athletic ability, but as a result of a driving desire that startsyoung and encompasses all areas of life.And so I asked if their goal is to get to heaven, what would the wiser choices to be making now? Staying in bed or getting up? Praying or playing Angry Birds? Reading the Bible or Harry Potter? Helping people or hurting them? Going to Church and religious instruction on Sundays or playing soccer? Studying or wasting our God-given brains? Respecting or driving crazy their parents and teachers? Praising or demeaning others? Lying or telling the truth? Being grateful for what they have or obsessing about what they don't? Reviewing their life to improve each day or ignoring and repeating their failings?&nbsp;&nbsp;I tried to help them to see that just like an athlete needs to practice certain things to do them correctly and more easily, so it's not enough for us just to know about the road to holiness that leads to heaven, but we need to put ourselves on that road and start going forward.&nbsp;To become holy, in short, we need to have a plan. We need to make sure it's the right plan that will accomplish what it sets out to do. And we need to act on the plan. That lesson is valid for all of us!&nbsp;<ul><li>"Fr. Roger Landry is one of the great voices of clarity in our times of confusion. He is a friend to your soul. In these pages he will be your spiritual guide. Chapter by chapter, he presents the great spiritual practices that will help you to build a Plan of Life. This book is like the man. It will inspire you to want to live a holy life. Every time I am with Father Landry, I walk about inspired, filled with hope, and hungry to be a better person and live a better life. These pages are dripping with that kind of hope and inspiration." -- Matthew Kelly, Founder of Dynamic Catholic &nbsp;(From the Foreward)</li><li>"Many of us try to squeeze God into our crowded life rather than seek to center our life around God. Fr. Landry not only shows us the path to unite our life to God but also accompanies us step by step in that transformation. This book will change you and may be just what you need to find the life you've always wanted and that God has wanted for you." --&nbsp;Archbishop Bernardito Auza, Permanent Representative of the Holy See to the UN</li><li>"The ultimate goal of the life of every Christian is union with the Blessed Trinity and eventually to be a saint. As Fr. Landry says, 'Every major goal in life requires a plan.' We plan our days, weeks, months, and years. We plan our appointments, activities, commitments, work, and business. How about planning our spiritual life? Father Landry shows in this book how to plan our spiritual journey so that we don't get lost on the way." --&nbsp;Bishop Edgar da Cunha, Bishop of Fall River</li><li>"To have a plan for daily living is posited on the premise that there is a purpose for life. This may seem obvious, but in our culture there are sad rumors that there is no reason for living beyond managing to exist. Since the Spirit gives life, spiritual practices are at the heart of living, and Fr. Landry suggests in clear and amiable ways, rather like Francis de Sales and Alfonsus Liguori, what this means." -- Fr. George Rutler, Pastor of St. Michael Parish, NYC</li><li>"'No one plans to fail, but many fail to plan.' Fr. Roger Landry has written an enormously helpful book for those planning to get to heaven. By explaining in clear and simple language the time-tested method of a 'Plan of Life,' Fr. Landry's book will encourage and inspire even the most lukewarm soul to become a better Christian. A must-have book for your spiritual reading library." --&nbsp;Fr. "Rocky" Hoffman, executive director of&nbsp;<i>Relevant Radio</i><b>&nbsp;</b></li><li>"The late Father Bob Bedard, founder of Canada's Companions of the Cross, told thousands of people the secret to a good spiritual life: 'The decision not to go to bed on time is a decision not to pray the next morning.' Rather simple. And true. Fr. Landry, in this most practical of books, takes you from that bedtime moment, to waking the next morning, to bedtime again and shows how--with work and study and family--you can consecrate that time to God. If you don't have a 'plan of life' you won't grow in friendship with God. You don't&nbsp;have&nbsp;to use this book, but why make it more di cult to begin without it?" --&nbsp;Fr. Raymond de Souza, editor in chief of&nbsp;Convivium&nbsp;magazine</li><li>"Fr. Landry has given us an easy-to-read guide on living a daily Catholic spiritual program that is challenging and rewarding, but not impossibly burdensome. He presents and explains various norms of piety that nourish us in our struggle to grow closer to God. This book informs, inspires, and encourages: you can grow in love for God by taking time to pray at different points throughout the day." --&nbsp;Fr. Gerald Murray, pastor of Holy Family Church, New York; member of EWTN's "Papal Posse"</li><li>"Fr. Landry is one of the leaders of the New Evangelization in the United States. His advice on how to be the missionary disciples we were all baptized to be is always thoughtful, engaging, and welcome." -- George Weigel, Ethics and Public Policy Center</li><li>"Fr. Landry was born to be a coach of the spiritual life. And this is the most accessible manual you could pick up for being seriously, joyfully Catholic now, in the busy-ness of your life. Your imitation in Christ will only grow if you follow this holy priest's advice." --&nbsp;Kathryn Jean Lopez, editor-at-large of&nbsp;National Review</li><li>"At a time when many Christians feel buffeted by the rising tide of secularism, Fr. Roger Landry's book is the ideal guide to higher and better ground.&nbsp;Plan of Life&nbsp;is nothing less than a beautiful answer to the prayer, 'Show me and my family how to live.' It's the perfect gift for Confirmation, graduation, birthdays, and every other milestone that's celebrated in this world while pointing to the next." --&nbsp;Mary Eberstadt, author of&nbsp;How the West Really Lost God</li><li>"We live in an age of spiritual junk food that brings momentary comfort, but little nutrition. This book is an eighteen-course meal of nourishment--bite-size portions that will bolster your spiritual health while provoking longings for the heavenly banquet. As a member of my 'Conclave Crew' during the election of Pope Francis, Fr. Landry made the most arcane details of Church history and doctrine accessible to everyone. His usual brilliance and heartfelt concern for souls is evident on every page of this much-needed book." --&nbsp;Raymond Arroyo,&nbsp;New York Times&nbsp;best-selling author, anchor of EWTN's&nbsp;The World Over Live</li><li>"I have twice been on pilgrimages to Rome with Father Landry and experienced, with other journalists, his opening up of the great treasures of faith there. So it is no surprise to see him offer here a brilliant little treasure chest of spiritual practices. Most people have a desire to grow closer to God but don't know how. Herein lies a map." --&nbsp;Peggy Noonan, Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist,&nbsp;Wall Street Journal</li><li>"Lots of people want to improve their spiritual lives and some make repeated efforts to do so. But many fail from not having personal guidance or a workable plan, something we would seek in any other part of life. Father Roger Landry's approach is not only clear and easy to follow, it's lively and spiritually enlightening on every page. One can't help but benefit from the wisdom and practical advice he offers. This is a book to read, and to keep handy to reread often." --&nbsp;Robert Royal, Faith &amp; Reason Institute</li><li>"Fr. Landry was instrumental in helping me embrace the Catholic faith. He has a way of explaining the faith with clarity, passion, and beauty. Reading this book has strengthened my faith and will help strengthen yours!" --&nbsp;Kirsten Powers, CNN political commentator,&nbsp;USA Today&nbsp;columnist</li><li>"Jesus calls us to friendship with him. How do we take up this wonderful invitation? Father Landry distills the Church's wisdom and provides what we all need--good counsel that's at once practical and spiritual. This is the perfect book for all Christians who want to drink more deeply from the spring of living water that wells up to eternal life." -- R.R. Reno, editor of&nbsp;First Things</li><li>"We like to plan out every aspect of our celebrations, our travel, and even our errand running, yet so often we leave our spiritual lives up to chance and then wonder why we're not getting any- where. Here, like a good coach, Fr. Landry reveals the 'game-plan' by which we can truly deepen our prayer lives, grow in our outreach, and pursue holiness.&nbsp;Plan of Life&nbsp;is a practical and inspiring exhortation to take up the tools, practices, and sacraments of the Church and use them to build a spiritual life that is ingrained, structured, and oriented toward heaven." -- Elizabeth Scalia, author of&nbsp;Strange Gods: Unmasking the Idols in Everyday Life</li></ul></p><h2>Amygdalatropolis</h2><p><p>From Schism[2] Press</p> <p>Amygdalatropolis is a work of brilliant neurorealism in which the city is a Computer, a libidinal pornutopia voided of all bedeutung other than the residual, electronic prickling of sexual fear and auto-autistic aggression where software and synapse flicker in an endless algorithmic loop.

She teaches Fashion History at the California College of Art.</p>What People Wore When combines the studies of two classic nineteenth-century illustrators, Auguste Racinet and Friedrich Hottenroth. According to the book&#x2019;s introduction, their work&nbsp;is presented first by era and&nbsp;then by subject, so that illustrators, historians, and students&nbsp;can choose to follow the path of fashion through the centuries or study in detail the contrasting styles of individual clothing and accessories. However, because the various drawings and illustrations are not attributed, the volume misses the chance to compare the works of these two famous costume historians. In the first section of the book, &#x201c;The Grammar of Costume,&#x201d; drawings&nbsp;portray the changing trends of fashion worldwide&nbsp;from ancient times to the mid&#x2013;nineteenth century. The second part, &#x201c;The Elements of Costume,&#x201d; surveys types of clothing and accessories, for example, &#x201c;Women&#x2019;s Dress, 1300&#x2013;1600&#x201d;&nbsp;and &#x201c;Regional Headwear.&#x201d; In both sections,&nbsp;cross-references and navigation bars draw attention to recurring motifs.&nbsp;A glossary&nbsp;defines most, but not all, of the terms that are italicized in the text, which was written by leading experts in the field of costume history. Detailed annotations of the drawings and illustrations, along with the glossary and index, provide an interesting study of the vocabulary of style through the ages. A couple of other books that do a good job of covering this broad span of the history of costume include Douglas W. Gorsline&#x2019;s What People Wore:&nbsp;A Visual History from Ancient Times to Twentieth-Century America (1952)&nbsp;and Bronwyn Cosgrave&#x2019;s The Complete History of Costume &amp; Fashion: From Egypt to the Present Day (2000). This book is recommended for most libraries and will be a welcome addition to the holdings of public, school, and academic libraries. --Diana Shonrock</p><h2>The Compelling Community: Where God&#39;s Power Makes a Church Attractive (9Marks)</h2><p><p><strong>What does a community that testifies to God's power look like?</strong></p><p>God&#x2019;s people are called to a togetherness and commitment that transcends all natural boundaries&#x2015;whether ethnic, generational, or economic.

Though it may appear small, it encompasses the contents of a whole encyclopedia. <br><br>This 2nd updated edition is based on new findings in mineralogy and new experiences and research results in the field of gem therapy, including information for an additional 125 crystals not present in the 1st edition, some of which that have been discovered in recent years. With <i>Healing Crystals</i> Michael Gienger presents a comprehensive directory of all the gemstones currently in use in crystal healing. Clear, concise and precise in style, with photographs of each of the crystals accompanying the text, he describes the characteristics and healing functions of each crystal.</p><p>Michael Gienger (1964-2014) was one of Europe&#x2019;s most respected experts on crystals and their uses, a field in which he had been active since 1988. He started collecting minerals in 1972, and in 1985 a successful self-treatment with healing crystals inspired him to pursue further training as an alternative healing practitioner. He was trained in shiatsu and completed a two-year apprentice in shamanic healing. He went on to author more than 20 publications, a number of which have become standard works in their field and have been translated into 11 languages.How to use this guide<br> The guide presents and defines the mineralogy and healing effects of crystals in common use, offering concise information on their basic properties. For further information, consult the indicated bibliography as needed. Terms used in the guide are as follows:<br> Title: the title of each entry gives the name or names of the illustrated crystal. In addition to the mineralogical name, the common or trade name is also used where relevant to define or describe the crystal in question. The scientifically recognised mineralogical names are printed in black, while common names are printed in blue. The titles serve as a suggestion to both gemstone dealers and interested readers of the correct and clear designation of the crystals.<br> Mineralogy: this gives a brief definition of the mineral with respect to the min- eralogy, especially its crystalline structure and nature of formation (&#x2018;prim.&#x2019; = molten magma formation, &#x2018;sec.&#x2019; = formation through disintegration and de- posits, &#x2018;tert.&#x2019; = metamorphic formation under heat and pressure).* In addition to the visible colour, these details are very important for the healing effect and application of a crystal. For further information on their significance, see Mi- chael Gienger&#x2019;s book Crystal Power, Crystal Healing (Cassell, London, 1998).<br> Indications: this gives information on the most important healing effects and areas of activity of each crystal, in particular the main properties that charac- terise the crystal and distinguish it from crystals with similar properties.

Also, the availability of a crystal is not always linked to how rare or common it is. Rare crystals that are well known are sometimes more readily available than more common but less known ones. The availability has been individually classified as follows:<br> Common: means it has been continuously available in large quantities over a long period of time and cut into different forms and shapes. No scarcity of the common shapes or forms is anticipated in the foreseeable future.<br> Readily available: means it is available most of the time. No major scarcities of particular forms are expected in the future.<br> Not always available: means not always obtainable. Sometimes there is a scarcity or just a few forms are available in limited quantities. The reserves fluctuate or are limited.<br> Scarce: means hardly available. There is a frequent scarcity over long periods of time. It is sometimes only available in very few forms.

She is the award-winning author of 13 cookbooks, including<i> New Vegetarian Cooking for Everyone </i>and <i>Vegetable Literacy</i>. Deborah is well known for her simple, seasonal, vegetable-based cooking. She got her start in the San Francisco Bay Area at Chez Panisse before opening Greens. In 1994, Madison received the M.F.K. Fisher Mid-Career Award from Les Dames d'Escoffier and in 2016 she was inducted into the James Beard Foundation Cookbook Hall of Fame.<b>INTRODUCTION</b><br><br>I started cooking for others decades ago. I cooked at the San Francisco Zen Center, Tassajara Zen Mountain Center (and resort, come summer), Green Gulch Farm, Chez Panisse in Berkeley, Greens in San Francisco, Caf� Escalera in Santa Fe, and the American Academy in Rome. I began cooking when vegetarian food was weird&#x2014;sincere, but stodgy&#x2014;and when there were few resources available to help one learn about how to put vegetables in the center of the plate. Now I am cooking at a time when vegetarian food is part of a great mash-up of taste, values, and experiences. It is finally much more accepted and really not such a big deal. One doesn&#x2019;t have to defend one&#x2019;s position nearly as often or as fiercely as one used to; and in any case, one&#x2019;s position can be quite fluid&#x2014;vegetarian one day, omnivore the next.<br><br> So much has changed in these decades, from values to ingredients, that it&#x2019;s sometimes hard for me to tell what people value when it comes to their own cooking. I look at a magazine that one week rates snacks at Trader Joe&#x2019;s and a few weeks later tells about the wonderful pastries you can make with brioche dough&#x2014;a challenging dough to make&#x2014;or how to butcher a lamb&#x2014;something that&#x2019;s not easily within the reach or desire of most people. My guess is that one&#x2019;s cooking life can be very fluid, too, that many people go to the effort to make something by hand&#x2014;to cook&#x2014;and probably the same people do plenty of assembling from premade foods. There may be lots of people who make their own pizzas&#x2014;I know one man who has made that his expertise&#x2014;but pizza places have also gotten much better (not the chains, but small independent businesses) that perhaps it&#x2019;s not as compelling to make your own as it was when there were no alternatives and we were curious. Fresh pasta used to be so important to make at home; now many of us can buy good fresh pasta, and there are some really excellent dried&nbsp;pastas now available, too. Other prepared foods, from salsas to fermented foods, tortillas to breads, have also gotten better, so why not use them? Good food matters and so does being able to make it ourselves. But when my cooking is helped by some of the products that are now available&#x2014;foods that are often made by people who care passionately about their craft&#x2014;I&#x2019;m happy to support their efforts just as their products support mine.<br><br>I cook every day, but when I recently looked at my notes, I realized that I hadn&#x2019;t made pasta by hand for some time, or pizza. I decided to revisit both, and it&#x2019;s been a pleasure, but it&#x2019;s also helped me realize that I prefer much simpler foods and preparations than I used to. We change as our culture changes, and I found I have been cooking in a more straightforward, less complicated fashion&#x2014;one that is, for the most part, no less delicious. Fresh pastas, yeasted dough, pies and tarts both savory and sweet, or an involved dish that proudly takes the center of the plate&#x2014;these still have their place. But some can be radically simplified without loss of flavor; or lightened, perhaps through the choice of one grain over another; or recast in light of the ingredients we have today that we didn&#x2019;t necessarily have in the past&#x2014;coconut oil, berbere, freekeh, chia seeds, smoked paprika, truffle salt, real balsamic vinegar, and heirloom beans, to name but a few.<br><br>If you garden, even a little, there&#x2019;s a host of interesting plants to grow and cook with, and some of those that come up by the zillions in springtime can be a source of exotic greens and garnishes. I&#x2019;ve also started to make use of some of the wild plants that are good to eat and are growing in my yard, and that has added to my kitchen vocabulary. Musk mustard in an herb, and wild green salad is a treat.<br><br><b><br><br>ARTICHOKE AND SCALLION SAUT� OVER GARLIC-RUBBED TOAST</b><br> <b>Serves 4; V<br></b><br> When I was spokesperson for the California Artichoke Board, boxes upon boxes of artichokes would arrive on my porch. I&#x2019;d hear them land with a thud, heaved there by the UPS driver. Of course it was a thrill to be the recipient of so many of these glorious, large flower-vegetables, but where to put them? They went into big coolers with plenty of ice. Then I got busy developing recipes, many of which have ended up in my various books. This little saut�, which I cooked frequently on TV, is one, and it has stood up as a favorite. Happily, it can also incorporate asparagus if you wish to add some (briefly parboiled), making for a more complex seasonal spring stew. Use large artichokes if you like, or the babies I&#x2019;ve used here. Because they grow low down on the large branches where they get little light, the so-called babies never develop a choke, or much size. They&#x2019;re very easy to work with, which I appreciate a lot.&nbsp;<br><br> Spoon these artichokes over garlic-rubbed toast and you have a good vegan supper sandwich. Sometimes I add a smear of ch�vre flavored with pepper and a bit of orange zest. You can also serve this saut� over pasta, polenta, or another grain, either alongside another dish or by itself.<br><b><br>20 to 24 baby artichokes</b><br> <b>Juice of 2 lemons&nbsp;</b><br> <b>Sea salt</b><br> <b>1 tablespoon mild vinegar</b><br> <b>2 cloves garlic&nbsp;</b><br> <b>2 heaping tablespoons of parsley</b><br> <b>Zest from 1 large lemon&nbsp;</b><br> <b>1 heaping tablespoon tarragon leaves</b><br><b>2 tablespoons olive oil, for cooking</b><br> <b>1 bunch scallions, including an inch of the greens, thickly sliced</b><br> <b>1&#x2044;2 cup dry white wine</b><br> <b>4 slices of strong country bread for toasting</b><br> <b>Best olive oil, for the toast</b><br> <b>Freshly ground pepper</b><br> <b>Chives and chive blossoms, if available</b><br><br>Trim the top third off the artichoke leaves and discard them. As you work, put the trimmed artichokes in a bowl with the lemon juice and enough water to cover. When all are trimmed, drain them, and then simmer them in salted water to which you&#x2019;ve added the vinegar (or use more lemon juice) until tender-firm, about 10 minutes. Drain the artichokes and slice them lengthwise into halves or quarters.&nbsp;<br><br>Finely chop one of the garlic cloves with the parsley, lemon zest, and tarragon, and set aside.<br><br>Heat the oil in a large skillet over high heat. Add the artichokes and saut� until they begin to color in places, after several minutes. Add the scallions and wine. When the wine boils off, add 1 cup of water and half the herb mixture. Lower the heat and simmer until the artichokes are fully tender, between 5 to 10 minutes.&nbsp;<br><br>Meanwhile, toast the bread. Cut the other garlic clove in half and rub it over the toast. When the artichokes are done, add the remainder of the herb mixture and season with salt and pepper. Tip them, with their juices, over the toast or onto a serving plate and garnish with snipped chives and chive blossoms if you have them.</p><h2>The Daily Stoic Journal: 366 Days of Writing and Reflection on the Art of Living</h2><p><p>Ryan Holiday has led the popular revival of stoicism since 2014, with his acclaimed bestsellers The Obstacle is the Way, Ego is the Enemy, and - in partnership with Stephen Hanselman - The Daily Stoic.

Recognizing the practical results being received by themselves and by those people who were asking practical questions and then applying Abraham&#x2019;s answers to their own situations, Esther and Jerry made a deliberate decision to allow the teachings of Abraham to become available to an ever-widening circle of seekers of how to live a happier life. Using their San Antonio, Texas, conference center as their base, Jerry and Esther have traveled to approximately 50 cities a year since 1989, presenting interactive Law of Attraction workshops to those leaders who gather to participate in this expanding stream of progressive thought. And although worldwide attention has been given to this philosophy of Well-Being by Leading Edge thinkers and teachers who have, in turn, incorporated many of Abraham&#x2019;s Law of Attraction concepts into their best-selling books, scripts, lectures, and so forth, the primary spread of this material has been from person to person&#x2014;as individuals begin to discover the value of this form of spiritual practicality in their personal life experiences. In November 2011, Jerry made his transition into Non-Physical, and now Esther continues to conduct the Abraham workshops with the help of her physical friends and co-workers and, of course, with the Non-Physical help of Abraham and Jerry. People are able to access Abraham directly by attending the seminars in person or by participating in the online live streaming of most events. There is also an extensive YouTube library of Abraham videos. Abraham&#x2014;a group of uplifting Non-Physical teachers&#x2014;present their Broader Perspective through Esther Hicks. And as they speak to our level of comprehension through a series of loving, allowing, brilliant, yet comprehensively simple essays in print and in sound, they guide us to a clear connection with our loving Inner Being, and to uplifting self-empowerment from our Total Self.

Then from the wild, uncharted north comes a mysterious and extraordinarily powerful philosopher-warrior, Anasurimbor Kellhus, descendant of the ancient High Kings. But the return of the king's bloodline is little cause for rejoicing. For Kellhus's appearance may signal the overthrow of empires, the destruction of the sorcerous schools, the return of the Consult demons--and the end of the world.<p> <i>The Darkness that Comes Before</i> is a strong, impressive, deeply imagined debut novel. However, this first book of an epic fantasy series is not accessible; it reads like a later volume of a complicated ongoing series. Author R. Scott Bakker has created a world that is very different from J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle Earth, yet in depth of development comes closer than most high-fantasy worlds. In addition to providing five appendices, Bakker attempts to make his complex world clear to readers by filling the prologue and opening chapters with the names of characters, gods, cities, tribes, nations, religions, factions, and sorcerous schools. For many readers, this approach will have the opposite effect of clarity. It's like demonstrating snowflake structure with a blizzard. <i>--Cynthia Ward</i></p><b>R.

This is the role of Merlin, Gandalf, Obi-Wan Kenobi and Albus Dumbledore. Such Wizards inspire boys to find their own power by introducing them to stars and constellations, awesome spells, magickal rituals, mystical lore, astonishing special effects and magic illusions. Most important, Wizards tell inspiring stories that teach profound lessons and bring to life the magic of the natural and supernatural worlds. <p>Wizard is a term deriving from the Anglo-Saxon wysard: "wise one." A Wizard is a lore-master, especially of arcane knowledge. A Wizard is also a magickal practitioner; however the word is rarely used today to describe a practitioner of Wicca (or Witchcraft)&#x2014;or a member of any particular faith. </p><p>I am a practicing Wizard writing for present and future generations of young men who dream of becoming Wizards. Through entering my daily life, boys will be introduced to a number of people&#x2014;historical, mythic, and living&#x2014;who comprise the Grey Council, the secret network of Wizards, Mages and Sages that spans all of history and includes wise and magickal folk of many cultures and traditions. </p><p>In this book the young Wizard will enter the story of an apprentice Wizard-in-training just as if they were sitting with me in my cluttered study&#x2014;replete with arcane artifacts, moldy bones, mysterious volumes of forgotten lore, and mystic occult secrets.</p>Foreword: The Grimoire and the Grey Council By Raymond Buckland <p>A great number of us have been wanting&#x2014;longing&#x2014;to board the Hogwarts Express and to travel to an academy that teaches the really exciting things in life. Things such as magick, herbal lore, divination, conjuring, and so on. In a word, we have been wanting to learn WIZARDRY. It&#x2019;s one thing to read about the experiences of someone else&#x2014;even such a fascinating person as Harry Potter&#x2014;but it&#x2019;s quite another thing to be able to go through the whole magickal educational process yourself. To enter such a school and know that your teachers are the very finest Wizards and Witches in the world would be awe-inspiring. So, how to do this? How to find and attend such a Wizard&#x2019;s academy? </p><p>You&#x2019;ll be happy to know that you don&#x2019;t have to wait for a special invitation to be delivered, be it by owl mail or otherwise. You don&#x2019;t even have to be the child of a Wizard or Witch. In fact you can even be a regular Muggle child and still get into this school. (It has been rumored that even some grown-up Muggles have been so attracted to it that they, too, have slipped in!) Where is this school? It&#x2019;s right here in your hands. The Course in Wizardry&#x2014;at least the Apprentice Level of the course&#x2014;is contained in this book. That&#x2019;s like suddenly discovering that there&#x2019;s a home study branch of Hogwarts Academy! Here may be found seven major courses, plus an appendix and bibliography, put together by the Grey Council of Wizards for you to study and learn. </p><p>Members of the Grey Council are living, breathing, famous Wizards and Witches of the present day. They are not "made up," or in any way invented by an author. They are alive and real and have been practicing their various crafts for up to forty or fifty years. When Harry Potter was first taking the Hogwarts Express to Hogwarts Academy, he was shown the trading cards of Witches and Wizards that came in the Chocolate Frogs packs. Ron Weasley introduced him to these, showing such famous personalities as Merlin, Paracelsus, Morgana, Circe, Ptolemy, Dumbledore, and Hengist. These were actually a mixture of real Witches and Wizards and those of fiction and legend. But in this book there are only real ones. </p><p>I have known Oberon Ravenheart for over 30 years. He is one of the pioneers of Paganism in the United States. I can&#x2019;t think of a better, more qualified person to write a handbook for apprentice Wizards. Oberon is a Wizard (he always has been!). With his many decades of experience he, more than anyone, is uniquely qualified to write this book, having been teaching for the majority of his life. His name is greatly respected in all of the varying fields of Paganism and Witchcraft. He is truly an Elder...of Paganism, Witchcraft, and Magic. </p><p>This is a grimoire. The word comes from the old French word meaning "grammar." It is, indeed, a grammar of magick. In other words, it explains exactly how magick is performed: how it is planned, prepared for, put together, and very carefully worked. You wouldn&#x2019;t expect to be able to learn a foreign language without doing some study. You would need to learn new words and how to put them together so that they made sense. You would need to know occasional alternate words that could be used, and the correct way to pronounce them. Well, so it is with magick. By learning the grammar/Grimoire, you will be able to not only make yourself understood (to the elements, the spirits, the animals, trees, plants, and all other aspects of nature&#x2014;plus, of course, to other Wizards), but you will be able to show that you are fluent in the language&#x2014;that you are a master of it. This translates into becoming a master Wizard; a magician recognized by his peers (those of equal standing) as competent and knowledgeable. </p><p>In so many subjects in everyday school, you sometimes find yourself wondering "Why do I have to learn this?" "What use is this to anyone?" You resist doing the work, the study, the homework. But with the Grimoire for the Apprentice Wizard, all that is changed! You will find yourself eagerly looking forward to the next step, and the one after that, and the one after that! Study will become a joy. You won&#x2019;t want to stop. Imagine learning such things as Foundations of Magick, Magickal Skills, The Soul of Nature, Tools of Magick, Wizardly Regalia, Spellcraft, Conjury, Magickal Bestiary, and so on and so on. What wonderful titles! What wonderful subjects! Wortcunning; Mathemagicks; Skrying. New words and ancient teachings. This is not just a book about Wizardry; it&#x2019;s a book of Wizardry! </p><p>Let this book take you on a journey. It opens on Wizardry, introduces you to ideas and concepts, then leads you along the secret path that wends its way through the sometimes fearsome appearing trees of the forest of ancient knowledge. Along the way you learn that all is not as it seems. What many people take as frightening, or scary, you will learn to be safe, inspiring, and power-enabling. The path through the woods goes on and on, but the deeper it goes, the more interesting you will find it. This is a little like venturing into the Forbidden Forest near Hogwarts. There will be temptations along the way. There will appear to be some short-cuts. But where do they really lead? The safest route is with your guides. Remember, Hagrid was not afraid of the forest, because he knew it and knew of its inhabitants. So with the Grey Council. We know the safest routes and will guide you safely. </p><p>Welcome to this unique course of magick, and know that you are setting your foot on the first step along the path that will take you out of the ordinary and into the special world of Wizardry.</p></p><h2>Residential Load Calculation Manual J�, Abridged Edition</h2><p>MJ8AE, an abridged version of the Eighth Edition of Manual J, provides complete instructions for estimating heat loss and heat gain for residential structures.

A hotbed for hip hop, underground culture, and unmatched creative energy, it spawned some of the most significant art of the 20th century. It was where Jean-Michel Basquiat became an avant-garde street artist and painter, swiftly achieving worldwide fame. During the years before his death at the age of 27, he shared his life with his lover and muse, Suzanne Mallouk. <br><br> A runaway from an unhappy home in Canada, Suzanne first met Jean-Michel in a bar on the Lower East Side in 1980. Thus began a tumultuous and passionate relationship that deeply influenced one of the most exceptional artists of our time.<br><br> In emotionally resonant prose, award-winning author Jennifer Clement tells the story of the passion that swept Suzanne and Jean-Michel into a short-lived, unforgettable affair. A poetic interpretation like no other, <i>Widow Basquiat</i> is an expression of the unrelenting power of addiction, obsession and love.</p><p>Jennifer Clement studied literature in New York and Paris. She was awarded the NEA Fellowship for Literature and the Sara Curry Humanitarian Award for her most recent novel, <i>Prayers for the Stolen</i>. Formerly president of PEN Mexico, she currently lives in Mexico City.She Is This Girl<br><br>She always keeps her heroin inside her beehive hairdo. The white powder hidden in the tease and spit. The cops can&#x2019;t find it. The drug addicts can&#x2019;t find it. Suzanne holds her head high. She&#x2019;s carrying a world without corners. She&#x2019;s holding up the sky. Slight enough to go down chimneys, Suzanne looks like a little girl dressed up in her mother&#x2019;s clothes. She wears Love That Red lipstick by Revlon and has blue-black hair and white skin. She closes up all the buttons on her shirt.<br><br>Suzanne can knit, ice-skate, sing, read palms and smoke dozens of cigarettes to keep warm inside. Little girls love her because she tells them, &#x201c;Hey, little missy, I can hear your heart.&#x201d; They think she&#x2019;s a music box.<br><br>When Suzanne was ten years old her mother said, &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s have a tea party.&#x201d; They sat together at the kitchen table. It was the first time Suzanne ever drank tea. She put four teaspoons of sugar in it. She said, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s too cold.&#x201d;<br><br>Her mother said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll only tell you this once so mark my words.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I broke the rocking horse,&#x201d; Suzanne said.<br><br>&#x201c;You of all my children were made like an angel. But you want to look over the edge to hell. Always know where that line is and never cross it. And here are nine kisses,&#x201d; her mother continued, &#x201c;for every year of your life.&#x201d;<br><br>While she kissed her again and again on the forehead, Suzanne wished her mother wore lipstick so that the kisses would be painted on her and everyone would know.<br><br>She wanted to say, &#x201c;But I&#x2019;m ten really.&#x201d;<br><br>Worn With Sounds<br><br>Suzanne&#x2019;s mother claims to be a witch. She puts her head down, claps her hands and concentrates. She calls this &#x201c;cursing people.&#x201d; Once a man who owned a television store in town asked her, &#x201c;Who winds you up in the morning?&#x201d; That night his store burned down. But she can&#x2019;t stop Suzanne&#x2019;s father from beating up the kids.<br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s an Arab,&#x201d; she says, &#x201c;What can I do? Curses don&#x2019;t get into those black eyes.&#x201d;<br><br>Suzanne has a scar on her forehead from when he threw her down the stairs. It is shaped like the number 5.<br><br>Her childhood is worn with sounds: chairs against walls; &#x201c;You good-for-nothing punk!&#x201d;; the snake-belly slide of a belt, the soft drum sound of a three-year-old&#x2019;s head against a wall; &#x201c;You good-for-nothing punk&#x201d;; tears that mix with Cap&#x2019;n Crunch cereal; &#x201c;You good-for-nothing punk&#x201d;; a hand the size of a maple leaf slapping; the twist and crack of arms and wrists; &#x201c;Walk on tiptoe, shhh,&#x201d; whisper. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s home.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry, honey,&#x201d; Suzanne&#x2019;s mother says to Suzanne. &#x201c;One day you&#x2019;ll set the world on fire.&#x201d;<br><br>Paper Dresses<br><br>Four draft dodgers and Suzanne sit at the kitchen table. Suzanne&#x2019;s mother is known in the underground of draft dodgers so men come to Orangeville, Ontario, Canada, to sit at this table dressed in love beads and leather bracelets to ask Suzanne where they can get some pot. Suzanne giggles and pulls some plastic bags filled with marijuana out of her white knee-high boots.<br><br>Suzanne wears paper dresses and maxi-coats. One draft dodger likes to tease her by burning cigarette holes in her dresses. Another one tells her if the war ever ends he&#x2019;s going to come back and marry her.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll never marry anyone,&#x201d; Suzanne says. &#x201c;No man is big enough for my arms.&#x201d;<br><br>I had very hardworking parents. My father had a painting/ construction business that at its height employed forty men. My mother had a nursery school in our house. She took all children. She did not close the door to any child. There were normal, autistic, blind and crippled children. There was nowhere for these disabled children to go. My mother was a real radical. During the Vietnam War she took in American draft dodgers. I was too young to know what this meant. These hippies with long hair and beards would just appear at the dinner table. During those Vietnam years my mother must have taken care of forty of these young men. My father was against this and I heard them fighting over it. My father thought they were cowards. My mother thought they were pacifists and she thought that they were too young. My mother became known in the underground of draft dodgers, and boys from all over America came, knowing they would get food and a roof over their heads. They would sleep on the living-room floor.<br><br>My father was intelligent and hardworking. He taught himself everything. He drove a big Cadillac so that we would be like the children of the doctors and lawyers. However, he was domineering and violent. He believed that we would respect him if we feared him. We feared him.<br><br>Only One Chromosome Is Missing<br><br>Suzanne walks down the steps from her bedroom. In the hall her mother is feeding a child who is tied with a rope to a chair. The little boy is tied up so he will not mutilate himself. He scratches his face until it bleeds. The doorbell rings and two more children with Down syndrome arrive. This is Suzanne&#x2019;s mother&#x2019;s latest business venture. There are no facilities for abnormal children in Orangeville.<br><br>Suzanne thinks, &#x201c;These are the children that need to go to the doll hospital.&#x201d;<br><br>For three years the house shelters three or four of these children a day. Their hands get washed, their backs get rubbed, they break things they find. But this house doesn&#x2019;t shelter black-and-blue children.<br><br>The black-and-blue children are thinking about running away. They think, &#x201c;We don&#x2019;t fit in this house.&#x201d;<br><br>Suzanne loves one of the kids called Sammy. Sammy is a six-year-old black girl. Suzanne knows only one chromosome is missing in her beautiful little face. Suzanne braids Sammy&#x2019;s hair and buys her candy.<br><br>Suzanne makes her dresses that she copies out of Vogue magazine and she teaches Sammy to count to five.<br><br>One day Suzanne and Sammy are sitting in the garden when Suzanne&#x2019;s mother comes outside. &#x201c;Now, you girls be careful, you&#x2019;re going to turn your skin too dark,&#x201d; she says.<br><br>Once she gave Suzanne a whole case of bleaching skin cream. &#x201c;If you think about it hard enough,&#x201d; Suzanne&#x2019;s mother says, &#x201c;you can change the way you look.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;If you think about it hard enough,&#x201d; Suzanne tells Sammy, &#x201c;you can make that chromosome grow in you.&#x201d; Sammy looks straight at the sun. She can do that and not even squint or blink.<br><br>The Magic Horsetail<br><br>Suzanne&#x2019;s mother has a magic horsetail. Out of a short, carved ivory stick hangs a white horse&#x2019;s tail. It was given to her by her great-aunt for luck when she was little, growing up in England. She took it with her to Beirut, where she was a British naval officer. It was here that she met Suzanne&#x2019;s father. Together they moved to Canada as Palestinian refugees. The horsetail has always been with her.<br><br>Suzanne braids the horsetail, shakes it around. &#x201c;Make lots of wishes with it, Suzy,&#x201d; Suzanne&#x2019;s mother says.<br><br>&#x201c;Did you make wishes with it?&#x201d; Suzanne asks.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, millions and millions. But I don&#x2019;t believe in making wishes.&#x201d;<br><br>Suzanne&#x2019;s mother always tells lies. She says she saw a woman in Beirut who had transparent skin. She says there are forty-two ways to cut an apple. She says she&#x2019;s seen the vaults with the gold reserves of England. She says the Earth has two moons. She says she has eaten sheep eyes, ant larvae and raw eggs because she was working as a spy.<br><br>She tells Suzanne, &#x201c;You have your father&#x2019;s barbaric blood. You are genetically more Arab than your brothers and sisters. You will always have problems with hysteria, rage and jealousy.&#x201d;<br><br>Every time Suzanne thinks about her mother&#x2019;s sulfur-blue eyes it rains.<br><br>Skeleton<br><br>Suzanne has always made a wish to herself. But it is not really a wish because it is going to happen no matter what. She&#x2019;s going to leave. She&#x2019;s known this ever since she could look in the mirror at her face.<br><br>When she was six, she walked alone around the block for the first time and it felt good. After that, she did it every day, always walking a little bit farther. In the winter, she&#x2019;d walk and walk around the house looking for cobwebs, which she would eat to make her strong.<br><br>Suzanne knows her skeleton. She knows where every bone is and which one hurts most. She knows the bruise from falling on ice is different from a bruise from a belt. She has studied the length of her tibia and the width of her femur. The pull of hair from the nape of the neck is different from the pull of hair from the forehead. She has learned the swivel and turn from a hand that can cover her whole face.<br><br>At night Suzanne lies in her bed listening to her father play trictrac with his friends who have also come to Canada as Palestinian refugees. Sometimes, she sneaks down, watches them, and her father pulls her out of the shadows.<br><br>He strokes her hair and gives her a taste of beer with his finger.<br><br>Sometimes I would jump on his back to stop him and I would get thrown across the room. Once when I was five he threw me down the stairs and I hit my head on a heater. I still have the scar on my forehead. He often threw us across the room and we would hit furniture or walls. He would also pick up furniture and throw it at us or break it.<br><br>What Furniture Feels Like<br><br>A chair feels like a slap. <br><br>A table feels like a kick. <br><br>A lamp feels like a punch. <br><br>A door feels like a shove, but it can be opened.<br><br>And a List of Good Excuses<br><br>&#x201c;I fell down the stairs.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;My brother punched me.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;I crashed into a tree on my bike.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;The door slammed in my face.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;I slipped on the ice.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t remember.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;My doll&#x2019;s hand scratched me.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;The rain fell hard.&#x201d;<br><br>You Can Always Come Back<br><br>&#x201c;I know you&#x2019;re going to leave. One day you&#x2019;ll figure it out and leave,&#x201d; Suzanne&#x2019;s mother says.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, I know, Mum,&#x201d; Suzanne answers.<br><br>&#x201c;Well, what have I taught you? What did I fill you up with? You know, Suzy, there&#x2019;s a big, bad wolf out there just waiting to eat you up. You can leave but you can always come back. You can live here again. Life can be a circle, not just a line. And don&#x2019;t chew gum ever, Suzy. No lady ever chews gum.&#x201d;<br><br>The Rainbow Is Here<br><br>Suzanne&#x2019;s father isn&#x2019;t going to hit her anymore because she&#x2019;s menstruating. She told him, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m a woman now. I&#x2019;m bleeding now. You can&#x2019;t touch me anymore.&#x201d;<br><br>The house is full of the smell of paint and paint thinners that Suzanne&#x2019;s father mixes up in the basement for his house-painting company. The smells fill up the house. Suzanne can tell by now if he&#x2019;s mixing blue or red or yellow. The smell sticks to everybody&#x2019;s skin. It stings Suzanne&#x2019;s mother&#x2019;s eyes. It burns her brothers&#x2019; and sisters&#x2019; skin. It makes some of the children faint. Sammy learns to cross her eyes. Suzanne giggles.<br><br>Sometimes, Suzanne goes down to the basement while her father is mixing the paint and they giggle together. The fumes are so strong they feel as if they are on a merry-go-round. Suzanne looks into the vat of cobalt blue and thinks she could swim in there. But she just dips her fingers in and they feel so cool.<br><br>The grass around the house turns yellow and two cats die from the fumes. Children stop coming to play. The mailman tells people he saw red vapor coming out of the windows. At school the teachers complain that these children are always coming to school with their clothes on inside out.<br><br>Suzanne&#x2019;s mother says, &#x201c;Children, you don&#x2019;t need to be going and leaving and looking for a rainbow. The rainbow is here.&#x201d;<br><br>Feel Gray, Must Exit<br><br>It&#x2019;s easy. You sell everything you own and buy a ticket. Even if you have no place to go, some words have to sing inside. Suzanne has the magic words; they are going to turn her into a bright flag, they are going to make her measure the length of her arms. The words are: Seville Hotel, New York City. It&#x2019;s easy. You sell everything you own.<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t cry over anything that can&#x2019;t cry over you,&#x201d; Suzanne&#x2019;s mother says.<br><br>Suzanne has a garage sale. She makes a big sign: FEEL GRAY, MUST EXIT. She sells everything and only keeps two pairs of pants and two T-shirts that she dyes gray in the bathtub.<br><br>Her mother buys her toothbrush for one dollar. Her sister buys her birth control pills and Iggy Pop records. Her father says, &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll be back.&#x201d;<br><br>Suzanne says, &#x201c;Maybe,&#x201d; and thinks, &#x201c;If you&#x2019;d never hit me, I wouldn&#x2019;t know my skeleton.&#x201d;<br><br>Thoughts on a Bus Trip<br><br>There are no footsteps, but you&#x2019;re moving. What is the distance between? Outside the trees move, the houses move. Inside everything is still. The woman in the back is weeping. She wipes her face with her sleeve. The smell of diesel is the smell of movement. Suzanne is sitting with her feet together, her knees together, her hands together, very prim as if waiting for a concert to begin.<br><br>Her mother kissed her forehead at the station, &#x201c;Be careful, Suzy,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Everybody is hungry.&#x201d; Her brothers and sisters gave her a card. It says, &#x201c;Suzy Q, we love you.&#x201d; Her father gave her twenty dollars. &#x201c;Call us,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>Suzanne sits still, so skinny, knowing the size of her bones. Knowing how to cover bruises with makeup. Knowing how to disappear. She thinks about Sammy, who came and left so quickly, who sucked the salt out of her fingers. She remembers the day Sammy learned to say &#x201c;Ouch.&#x201d; And that was all she would say forever after, &#x201c;Ouch, ouch, ouch,&#x201d; like a little song.<br><br>Suzanne came home from school one day and Sammy wasn&#x2019;t there anymore. &#x201c;You know how these kids are, Suzy,&#x201d; Suzanne&#x2019;s mother said. &#x201c;They just kind of come and go. She was sweet, though.&#x201d;<br><br>You can&#x2019;t get your arms to stop making circles in the air if you never say good-bye.<br><br>But the reason I decided to go to New York was because I had seen Iggy Pop and I thought I had seen God. And because I had sent to Interview magazine for Rene Ricard&#x2019;s first book of poetry, The Blue Book. I had never sent for anything before but something told me to do this.

Coffee is a global beverage: it&#x2019;s grown commercially on four continents and consumed enthusiastically on all seven&#x2014;and there is even an Italian espresso machine on the International Space Station. Coffee&#x2019;s journey has taken it from the forests of Ethiopia to the <i>fincas</i> of Latin America, from Ottoman coffee houses to &#x201c;Third Wave&#x201d; caf�s, and from the simple coffee pot to the capsule machine. In <i>Coffee: A Global History</i>, Jonathan Morris explains both how the world acquired a taste for this humble bean, and why the beverage tastes so differently throughout the world.<br><br> Sifting through the grounds of coffee history, Morris discusses the diverse cast of caffeinated characters who drank coffee, why and where they did so, as well as how it was prepared and what it tasted like. He identifies the regions and ways in which coffee has been grown, who worked the farms and who owned them, and how the beans were processed, traded, and transported. Morris also explores the businesses behind coffee&#x2014;the brokers, roasters, and machine manufacturers&#x2014;and dissects the geopolitics linking producers to consumers. Written in a style as invigorating as that first cup of Java, and featuring fantastic recipes, images, stories, and surprising facts, <i>Coffee</i> will fascinate foodies, food historians, baristas, and the many people who regard this ancient brew as a staple of modern life.</p><p><b>Jonathan Morris</b> is research professor at the University of Hertfordshire.

So when he learned that there were only a handful of northern white rhinos left in the wild, living in an area of the Congo controlled by the infamous Lord's Resistance Army, he was determined to save them from extinction. If the world lost this subspecies of rhinoceros, it would be the largest land mammal since the woolly mammoth to go extinct, a tragedy for those who care about the world's endangered species.</p><p>What followed was an extraordinary adventure, as Anthony headed into the jungle to ask the rebels to help protect the rhino. Sometimes funny, sometimes moving, and always exciting,<i> The Last Rhinos </i>tells the story of his fight to save these remarkable creatures.</p></p><p><p>LAWRENCE ANTHONY (1950&#x2013;2012) founded the Thula Thula wildlife reserve in Zululand, South Africa; launched The Lawrence Anthony Foundation; and received the UN's Earth Day award for his efforts to save the animals of the Baghdad Zoo. GRAHAM SPENCE is a journalist and editor. Originally from South Africa, he lives in England. Together they are the authors of <i>Babylon's Ark: The Incredible Wartime Rescue of the Baghdad Zoo </i>and <i>The Elephant Whisperer: My Life with the Herd in the African Wild.</i></p>THE LAST RHINOS (Chapter One)<p>It was barely light when the radio first crackled into life.</p><p>'Code red! Code red! Come in, Lawrence, come in. Over.'</p><p>'Standing by.'</p><p>'Bad morning.' The caller paused. 'We have a dead rhino at Hlaza Hill. A female. Over.'</p><p>Dread froze my blood. I looked up at the sky above the distant Hlaza Hill, the highest point on the new community game reserve that abuts Thula Thula, my own reserve and my home in Zululand, South Africa. There were no vultures and no gunshots had been reported, a sound that echoes like a thunderbolt across the African wilderness when the wind is right.</p><p>'Cause of death?' I asked, fearing the worst.</p><p>'Poachers. Both horns are gone. There's blood all over the place. Professional job. Looks like they used an AK-47, or maybe an old military-issue R1.'</p><p>I could feel my fists clenching. Rhino poachers - the disease of the wild that was now becoming a pandemic.</p><p>'How long has she been dead?' I asked.</p><p>'Can't be more than a few hours. They probably took it around midnight. There was plenty of moon to help them.'</p><p>'OK, I'll be there now. Out.'</p><p>I glanced at the pump-action shotgun leaning against the passenger seat of my Land Rover, reached for the ammunition box and stuffed my pockets with handfuls of SG cartridges. I hoped against hope that the poachers were still on the reserve.</p><p>The green-black flies were already gathering when I arrived at the hill. The air was metallic with the rank smell of blood. The rhino lay uncharacteristically on her side, legs splayed awkwardly at right angles to her stiff body.</p><p>I got out of the Land Rover and walked across to the three rangers standing nearby. Nobody said anything. The shock of the kill, the dominating presence of the huge dead creature, stifled our words.</p><p>Rhinos have an ancient, eternal beauty. With their massive bodies, clad in thick folds of prehistoric body armour topped by a magnificent scimitar horn, they fascinate like few other creatures. Weighing up to three and half tons and reaching six feet high, they are the largest land animal in the world after the elephant.</p><p>In death, there was no trace of that beauty. The regal horns, viciously hacked off with honed machetes - or pangas, as we call them in Africa - left the noble face crumpled and desecrated. The eyes gazed vacantly. Pools of blood had congealed around the grotesquely disfigured head. Without its horn, the imposing creature looked as vulnerable as a baby.</p><p>I could see my own turmoil mirrored in the rangers' faces. In Africa, the war against poachers is intensely personal. There are two types of poacher: the local tribesman looking for something small for the pot; and the heavyweights, the professional killers, who want rhino horn and elephant ivory, who will shoot a ranger then brag about it. Poaching any animal is a crime, but killing a rhino or elephant is not shooting to feed a hungry family. It's blood money. And it's an intimate, violent invasion of our lives.</p><p>'Who found the body?'</p><p>Bheki, my most trusted ranger, looked up and pointed at a young Zulu guard, Simelane, standing a little way off. I beckoned for him to come over.</p><p>'Sawubona, Simelane,' I greeted him. 'What happened here?'</p><p>'Sawubona, Mkhulu. I was on patrol when I saw the dead rhino,' he replied quietly, staring at the ground.</p><p>'Who was with you?'</p><p>'I was alone.'</p><p>'You were on patrol out here all alone?' I asked, surprised. Poaching patrols always consisted of two armed men.</p><p>'Yes, I was alone.' He was barely whispering.</p><p>I was about to press on with the questioning when a loud Zulu voice interrupted me.</p><p>'Mkhulu, there is too much blood.'</p><p>It was Bheki, down on one knee closely examining the rhino's head.</p><p>'There is too much blood,' he repeated. 'That means they were in a hurry. They took the horns while she was still alive. Maybe unconscious, but alive.'</p><p>For a moment we just stared at Bheki. Then it sank in. These monsters had hacked the horn off a living animal.</p><p>'Which way did they go?' I asked Bheki, who had been at my side in several firefights with poachers over the past decade.</p><p>He pointed east. 'Four, maybe five hours ago.'</p><p>That meant that unless they were in hiding, they would be almost out of the reserve and heading towards the townships, where we would never catch them. However, that didn't mean we wouldn't try. At the very least, it would give us something physical to do to vent our fury.</p><p>'OK, we all know the drill,' I said. 'These guys are probably carrying AKs and we all know what that means. If we make contact and they so much as think of lifting their rifles, shoot fast and shoot first, as we'll be up against automatic fire.'</p><p>I looked at the solemn faces. Armed only with shotguns and Second World War-era Lee-Enfield .303 bolt-action rifles, they were completely out-gunned, but that would not deter these hard, dedicated men for a moment. They would be facing automatic weapons, replying as fast as their wrists could work their rifle bolts. You cannot imagine the courage that takes. I had a pump-action shotgun that was fast and deadly and spread nine lead balls in a lethal cluster. Our weapons complemented each other well. The .303s had a longer range than an AK, and the shotguns at close quarters in thick bush didn't miss. Used in tandem they were a match for the illegal AK-47s so favoured by poachers. 'Bring your own water and keep your safety catches on. Let's go!' We would be moving as fast as we could in thick bush, and I didn't want anyone tripping and blasting the person ahead of them.</p><p>The going was tough and by mid-morning we were well off the beaten path, following barely discernible game trails used by the poachers. The sun burned relentlessly, a typical Zululand scorcher, and sweat poured from our bodies, stinging our eyes and drenching our shirts. But hyped up with adrenalin and anticipation, we never eased our blistering pace. If we faltered, any slim chance of catching them would be lost.</p><p>It's difficult to remain calm when you see a rhino brutally slaughtered for a horn that consists of little more than keratin, the same fibrous structural protein you find in hair and fingernails. In fact, it's impossible. You're more likely to be consumed by raging fury, but that won't do any good. Rhino horns are used for mythical medicinal purposes in countries across Asia, as part of their traditional healing systems. In traditional Chinese medicine it is believed to cure types of fever, for instance. And the increasing wealth of these economies has created an insatiable demand. Tens of thousands of rhino have been killed in Africa, with several subspecies hunted to extinction. The demand is reminiscent of a nineteenth-century gold rush, and with good reason. On the streets of China or Vietnam, ounce for ounce the horn is more valuable than gold. If you truly want to grasp the situation faced by conservationists, do what a poacher does and look at a rhino and see a three-foot-long horn made of pure gold. Game rangers are in the unenviable and extremely hazardous position of trying to protect solid gold. What should be locked securely in a vault instead walks around on four legs in the bush.</p><p>It is not an exaggeration to say that every rhino on the planet is now in mortal danger. Unless something fundamental changes, and quickly, every last one in the wild will eventually be killed.</p><p>As we pushed on, we periodically picked up traces of the killers' trail, such as footprints, a small patch of flattened grass, a marked tree or flecks of blood, probably oozing from the horn that the killers would be carrying in a hessian sack. These signs that we were on the right track provided the edge we needed, with Bheki urging us to speed up the chase.</p><p>However, Simelane, the young Zulu ranger who had discovered the dead rhino, was starting to worry me. Twice he veered off into the bush alone, following false leads and losing us valuable time. Maybe his strange behaviour was due to the stress of tracking the killers, I thought, as well as the possibility of an ambush around the next corner.</p><p>An ambush was my biggest worry. The penalty in South Africa for rhino poaching is a fifteen-year jail sentence and there was no way these professional killers were going to risk being sent away for that long. They knew it and we knew it. If the killers sensed they were being followed and were waiting for us, there is no doubt we would be in a lethal firefight - at close quarters, in thick bush, with minimum visibility and maximum chaos.</p><p>Eventually the punishing pace took its toll. I called a halt for a brief rest and sent one of the rangers ahead to high ground to try and pick them out from above.</p><p>'Nothing,' came the reply on the radio from a nearby hill. 'I see nothing.'</p><p>I could tell by the frustrated look on Bheki's face as we waited that the spoor was now cold. We were too late; and, sure enough, a couple of hours later when we finally reached the boundary fence, all we found was a slash where they had snipped through the wire, carefully avoiding the electric strands. They were well and truly gone.</p><p>'Next time,' I heard Bheki whisper as he unloaded his .303. 'We will get them next time, Mkhulu.'</p><p>I nodded silently, also unloading my shotgun as we started the long trek back.</p><p>At home, I reported the incident, first to the police and then to our local Parks authority, KwaZulu-Natal Wildlife. The latter phone call was tough, as they had just donated the now dead animal to a project I was working on. I was joining my reserve, Thula Thula, with the huge Zulu tribal trust areas to form what we believed would be one of the finest game reserves in the country. It was to be called the Royal Zulu and would be a unique joint venture with local tribes. The project would provide meaningful benefits to poor rural communities through conservation and eco-tourism, giving them a stake in the future of the African wilderness. Thanks to years of apartheid when game reserves had been racially exclusive, man...</p></p><h2>Food Over Medicine: The Conversation That Could Save Your Life</h2><p>Nearly half of Americans take at least one prescription medicine, with almost a quarter taking three or more, as diseases such as diabetes, obesity, and dementia grow more prevalent than ever.

By reflecting on the lessons learned from her various expeditions, author Alison Levine makes the case that the leadership principles that apply in extreme adventure sport also apply in today's extreme business environments. Both settings require you to be able to make crucial decisions on the spot when the conditions around you are far from perfect. Your survival -and the survival of your team-depend on it. Featuring a Foreword from legendary Duke University basketball coach Mike Krzyzewski who knows all about leadership, On the Edge provides a framework to help people scale whatever big peaks they aspire to climb-be they literal or figurative-by offering practical, humorous, and often unorthodox advice about how to grow as a leader.</p><p>Alison Levine is a history-making polar explorer and mountaineer. She has climbed the highest peak on each continent, served as team captain of the first American Women's Everest Expedition and skied to both the North and South Poles. She holds an MBA from Duke University and served as an adjunct instructor at the United States Military Academy at West Point in the Department of Behavioral Sciences &amp; Leadership.<br>Levine is a sought-after keynote speaker on the topic of leadership development and has addressed audiences ranging from Fortune 500 companies to the World Economic Forum in Davos. Having spent prolonged periods of time in some of the world's most dangerous and inhospitable places, she addresses the topics of creating cohesive teams, taking responsible risks and developing no-nonsense leaders that can succeed in times of uncertainty.<br>Levine serves on the advisory board of the Coach K Center on Leadership &amp; Ethics at Duke University and is a strategic advisor for the Thayer Leader Development Group at West Point. She was a contributing author to the book Leadership in Dangerous Situations: A Handbook for the Armed Forces, Emergency Services and First Responders (Naval Institute Press). <br><br>"A good read, filled with humor and shrewd observations about human nature."<br><b>--</b><b> <i>The Wall Street Journal</i></b><br><br><b>Publisher's Weekly Starred Review</b><br>"In her assured, personable debut, Levine-team captain of the first American Women's Everest Expedition and a former associate at Goldman Sachs-takes lessons learned on the slopes of the world's tallest mountains and applies them to everyday business challenges for executives at all levels, as well as politicians, educators, and students. On the premise that "everyone is in a leadership position," Levine covers topics including extreme preparation, the importance of failure, succeeding in difficult conditions, networking, ego management, making the most of weakness, building trust and loyalty, and bringing your A-game to every challenge. Levine writes, "leadership in extreme environments requires the willpower, the teamwork, the high moral character, and the emotional intelligence necessary to overcome exceptional hurdles, solve complex problems, and face any sudden, uncontrollable, high-risk situation, including those that exist in today's business world." The book is best suited to readers looking for their advice framed in an adventure story; the lessons within are cast in broad strokes, appealing, perhaps, to business readers who prefer not to read the words "synergy" or "laser-focus" yet again. If they can get past the feeling of inferiority from reading the work of a business-savvy extreme climber who's also funny, readers will find much to learn here."<br>"<i>On the Edge</i> is terrific, containing a mountain of valuable leadership advice that will appeal to executives, politicians, educators and students, parents, and athletes and coaches. Levine's peak performances give a whole new meaning to the idea of a leadership summit." <b>-- SUCCESS Magazine</b><br>"A unique approach to leadership development. While the advice in <i>On the Edge</i> might seem counterintuitive (like the practice of going without sleep or rewarding people who failed), Levine lays out her case using her signature humor style and real world examples from leaders in sports and the military, and she uses her own experiences as a mountaineer to support her unorthodox recommendations. <em>On the Edge</em> will make you re-think leadership."<br><strong>--Shawn Achor, positive psychology researcher and NY Times bestselling author of <i>Before Happiness</i></strong><br><br>A completely different approach to leadership development that provides invaluable advice not only for business, but also for life's every-day challenges. Presented with humility and humor, ON THE EDGE guides us towards exploring the very best of ourselves. <br><b>--Jo Ann Ross, President, Network Sales, CBS Television Network</b><br>An irresistible book that gives readers a glimpse into the sensibilities of one of the finest natural leaders I have ever known. Alison Levine's ON THE EDGE offers amazing insights....timely, practical lessons and authentic inspiration delivered with candor and spunk. <br><b>-- Brigadier General (Ret.) Tom Kolditz Professor Emeritus, U.S. Military Academy, Dept. of Behavioral Sciences &amp; Leadership <br></b><br>"Despite the fact that Alison Levine lectures at West Point (Go Navy!), her contrarian approach to leader development makes for a compelling read. Using her amazing experiences as an accomplished mountaineer, Levine relates remarkable insights while revealing how leadership skills can be learned in any kind of challenging environment -- whether it be in the corporate world or climbing peaks in sub-zero temperatures."<br><b>-- D.

The group of men who traveled to Philadelphia in the summer of 1787 had no idea what kind of history their meeting would make. But all their ideas, arguments, and compromises&#x2014;from the creation of the Constitution itself, article by article, to the insistence that it remain a living, evolving document&#x2014;laid the foundation for a government that has surpassed the founders' greatest hopes. Revisiting all the original historical documents of the period and drawing from her deep knowledge of eighteenth-century politics, Carol Berkin opens up the hearts and minds of America's founders, revealing the issues they faced, the times they lived in, and their humble expectations of success.</p></p><p>"The majority of historians seem to suggest that the founders knew just what to do--and did it, creating a government that would endure for centuries," writes CUNY historian Carol Berkin in the introduction to <i>A Brilliant Solution</i>. Sitting atop the pedestals we've placed them on, these figures would be "amused" by such notions, she says, because in reality the Constitutional Convention was gripped by "a near-paranoid fear of conspiracies" and might easily have succumbed to "a collective anxiety" over its daunting task. The story of the birth of the U.S. Constitution has been told many times, perhaps best by Catherine Drinker Bowen in <i>Miracle at Philadelphia</i>. Berkin's rendition of these well-known events is clear and concise. It does a bit more telling than showing, but this seems to be in the service of brevity--the main text is only about 200 pages. (Another 100 pages of useful appendices follow, including the full texts of the Articles of Confederation and the Constitution, plus short biographies of all the convention delegates.) Berkin is an opinionated narrator, unafraid, for instance, to call Maryland's Luther Martin "determinedly uncouth." She also points out that American government has evolved in ways that would make the founders cringe: they believed the presidency would be a ceremonial office (rather than the locus of the nation's political power) and that political parties were bad (when, in fact, they have served democracy well). Readers who want a sure-footed introduction to America's founding would do well to start here. <i>--John J.

What we don't see is how both powerful and ordinary people are remaking their lives as their country dramatically changes.<br> As the Beijing correspondent for <i>The New Yorker</i>, Evan Osnos was on the ground in China for years, witness to profound political, economic, and cultural upheaval. In <i>Age of Ambition</i>, he describes the greatest collision taking place in that country: the clash between the rise of the individual and the Communist Party's struggle to retain control. He asks probing questions: Why does a government with more success lifting people from poverty than any civilization in history choose to put strict restraints on freedom of expression? Why do millions of young Chinese professionals-fluent in English and devoted to Western pop culture-consider themselves "angry youth," dedicated to resisting the West's influence? How are Chinese from all strata finding meaning after two decades of the relentless pursuit of wealth?<br> Writing with great narrative verve and a keen sense of irony, Osnos follows the moving stories of everyday people and reveals life in the new China to be a battleground between aspiration and authoritarianism, in which only one can prevail.</p></p><p><b>Evan Osnos</b> is a staff writer at <i>The New Yorker</i>, where he served as the China correspondent from 2008 to 2013.

He moved as calmly as possible, over the pine scrub to a ledge overlooking the shore. If his plan were discovered, he would be disgraced and executed.</p> <p>Capt. Lin Zhengyi was a model soldier, one of the most celebrated young officers in the army of Taiwan, the island province ruled by opponents of the Chinese Communist Party. For three decades Taiwan had defied Communist control, and Captain Lin was a symbol of that resistance: in college, he had been a star student who&#x2019;d given up a placid civilian life to join the military, a decision so rare that Taiwan&#x2019;s future president made a point to shake his hand, and the picture was splashed all over the newspapers, turning Lin into a poster boy for the &#x201c;Holy Counterattack,&#x201d; the dream of retaking mainland China.</p> <p>Lin Zhengyi (pronounced &#x201c;Jung-yee&#x201d;) stood nearly six feet tall, with ramrod posture, a broad, flat nose, and jug ears that protruded from the rim of his hat. His devotion had earned him the assignment to the most sensitive place on the front line: the tiny island of Quemoy, known in Mandarin as Jinmen, barely one mile, across the water, from the rocky coast of mainland China.</p> <p>But Captain Lin had a secret so dangerous to him and his family that he did not dare reveal it even to his wife, who was home with their son and pregnant with their second child. Captain Lin had awoken to a sense of history gathering around him. After thirty years of turmoil, China was appealing to the people of Taiwan to reunify the &#x201c;great Motherland.&#x201d; Any soldier who tried to defect to the mainland would be shot on sight. The few who tried were exceedingly rare, though the consequences were vivid; the most recent case had occurred less than a month ago. But Lin had heard his calling. China would prosper again, he believed. And he would prosper with it.</p> <p>In the darkness he found the sandy path that could lead him safely down a hill laden with land mines. The wind off the sea had bent the gnarled island pines. The water, a brilliant crystal green by day, was now an endless black mass, surging and withdrawing with the waves. To ward off an invasion, the beaches had been fitted with long metal spears that protruded from the sand to face the sea.</p> <p>Just before the captain left the tree line for the dash to shore, he loosened the laces of his shoes and stepped barefoot onto the soil and stone. He was ready to abandon his fellow soldiers, his family, and his name.</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>Virtually everyone else who had tried to swim those waters had headed in the opposite direction. In 1979, mainland China was a place to flee.</p> <p>In the eighteenth century, imperial China controlled one-third of the world&#x2019;s wealth; its most advanced cities were as prosperous and commercialized as Great Britain and the Netherlands. But in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, China was crippled by invasion, civil war, and political upheaval. After taking power in 1949, the Communist Party conducted a &#x201c;land reform&#x201d; campaign that grouped China&#x2019;s small family farms into collectives, and led to the killing of millions of landlords and perceived enemies. In 1958, Chairman Mao launched the Great Leap Forward, attempting to vault his country past Britain in just fifteen years. Some advisers told him it was impossible, but he ignored and humiliated them; the head of the national technology commission jumped out a window. The propagandists hailed one fantastical harvest after another, calling them &#x201c;Sputnik harvests,&#x201d; on par with the success of the Soviet satellite. But the numbers were fiction, and as starvation spread, many who complained were tortured or killed. The Party barred people from traveling to find food. Mao&#x2019;s Great Leap Forward resulted in the world&#x2019;s worst famine, which killed between thirty and forty-five million people, more than World War I. By the time Captain Lin defected from Taiwan, the People&#x2019;s Republic was poorer than North Korea; its per capita income was one-third that of sub-Saharan Africa.</p> <p>Deng Xiaoping had been China&#x2019;s paramount leader for less than six months. At seventy-five, he was a persuasive but plainspoken statesman, and a survivor&#x2014;repeatedly purged from the leadership by Chairman Mao, twice rehabilitated. In the years since, he has often been described as the sole architect of the boom that followed, but that view is the handiwork of Party historians. Deng understood the limitations of his knowledge. On matters of the economy, his shrewdest move was to unite with Chen Yun, a fellow Party patriarch who was so skeptical of the West that he greeted the idea of reform by rereading Lenin&#x2019;s <i>Imperialism</i>; and with Zhao Ziyang, a younger, progressive Party boss whose efforts to reduce poverty had spawned a saying among peasants: &#x201c;If you want to eat, look for Ziyang.&#x201d;</p> <p>When change came, it came from below. The previous winter, in the inland village of Xiaogang, the local farmers had been so impoverished by Mao&#x2019;s economic vision that they had stopped tilling their communal land and had resorted to begging. In desperation, eighteen farmers divided up the land and began to farm it separately; they set their own schedules, and whatever they sold beyond the quota required by the state, they sold at the market and reaped the profits. They signed a secret pact to protect one another&#x2019;s families in the event of arrest.</p> <p>By the following year, they were earning nearly twenty times as much income as before. When the experiment was discovered, some apparatchiks accused them of &#x201c;digging up the cornerstone of socialism,&#x201d; but wiser leaders allowed their scheme to continue, and eventually expanded it to eight hundred million farmers around the country. The return of &#x201c;household&#x201d; farming, as it was known, spread so fast that a farmer compared it to a germ in a henhouse. &#x201c;When one family&#x2019;s chicken catches the disease, the whole village catches it. When one village has it, the whole county will be infected.&#x201d;</p> <p>Deng and the other leaders squabbled constantly, but the combination of Deng&#x2019;s charisma, Chen&#x2019;s hesitation to move too fast, and Zhao&#x2019;s competence was startlingly successful. The model they created endured for decades: a &#x201c;birdcage economy,&#x201d; as Chen Yun called it, airy enough to let the market thrive but not so free as to let it escape. As young revolutionaries, the elders had overseen the execution of landlords, the seizure of factories, and the creation of people&#x2019;s communes. But now they preserved their power by turning the revolution upside down: permitting private enterprise and opening a window to the outside world even if it allowed, as Deng put it, &#x201c;a few flies&#x201d; to get in. China&#x2019;s reforms had no blueprint. The strategy, as Chen Yun put it, was to move without losing control&#x2014;to &#x201c;cross the river by feeling for the stones.&#x201d; (Deng, inevitably, received credit for the expression.)</p> <p>In 1979 the Party announced that it would no longer tag people as &#x201c;landlords&#x201d; and &#x201c;rich peasants,&#x201d; and later Deng Xiaoping removed the final stigma: &#x201c;Let some people get rich first,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;and gradually all the people should get rich together.&#x201d; The Party extended the economic experiment. Officially, private businesses were permitted to hire no more than eight employees&#x2014;Marx had believed that firms with more than eight workers were exploitative&#x2014;but eventually small enterprises began popping up so fast that Deng Xiaoping told a Yugoslav delegation that it was &#x201c;as if a strange army had appeared suddenly from nowhere.&#x201d; He did not take credit. &#x201c;This is not the achievement of our central government,&#x201d; he said.</p> <p>All over the country, people were exiting the collective farms that had dominated their lives. When they talked about it, they said they had been <i>songbang&#x2014;</i>&#x201c;unfettered&#x201d;&#x2014;a term more often used for a liberated prisoner or an animal. They began to talk of politics and democracy. But Deng Xiaoping had his limits. In March 1979, not long before Lin Zhengyi embarked on his adventure to the mainland, Deng spoke to a group of senior officials and demanded, &#x201c;Can we tolerate this kind of freedom of speech which flagrantly contravenes the principles of our constitution?&#x201d; The Party would never embrace &#x201c;individualist democracy.&#x201d; It would have economic freedom but political control. For China to thrive, there must be limits on &#x201c;emancipating the mind.&#x201d;</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>When change began to take hold on the mainland, Lin Zhengyi watched it from afar. He was born in 1952, three years after Taiwan and the mainland had embarked on the ideological and political standoff that would endure for decades. After losing China&#x2019;s civil war to the Communists in 1949, the Nationalist Party fled to the island of Taiwan, where it declared martial law over the islands and prepared, in theory, for the day that it might return to power over China. Life in Taiwan was harsh and circumscribed. Lin grew up in the lush river delta town of Yilan, in a remote corner of Taiwan&#x2019;s main island. His family was descended from earlier migrants from the mainland. The arriving Nationalist forces viewed the earlier migrants as low-class and politically unreliable, and they were subject to widespread discrimination in jobs and education.</p> <p>His father, Lin Huoshu, ran a barbershop, and his mother took in laundry from the neighbors. The family lived in a shanty on the edge of town. But the father taught his children about ancient Chinese science and statecraft, about a civilization once so advanced that it started printing books four hundred years before Gutenberg. He read aloud from the old books&#x2014;<i>The Three Kingdoms</i>, <i>Journey to the West</i>&#x2014;and he drilled into his children the dream of China&#x2019;s revival. He named his fourth child Zhengyi because it meant &#x201c;justice.&#x201d;</p> <p>As a boy, Lin wondered why, despite China&#x2019;s glorious history, his family could barely feed itself. His older brother did not ask their mother if they would have lunch, because it was an uncomfortable question, Lin recalled. &#x201c;He would lean on the stove. If it was warm, that means we had lunch.&#x201d; Otherwise, they went hungry. For Lin, the experience fostered a highly pragmatic streak. He came to view issues of human dignity primarily through the lenses of history and economics.</p> <p>In his teens, he gravitated to tales about engineering&#x2014;the exploits of ancient Chinese leaders such as Li Bing, a governor in the third century B.C.E., in today&#x2019;s Sichuan Province, who set out to control deadly floods by devoting eight years to digging a water channel through a mountain. He relied on thousands of workers, who heated the rocks with hay fires and cooled them with water to make them crack. The result was an irrigation system so vast and durable that it is often compared to the wonders of the world; it transformed one of the country&#x2019;s poorest stretches into a region so fertile that it is known today as the &#x201c;Land of Heaven.&#x201d;</p> <p>Lin was the most promising of the sons, and in 1971 he won a coveted seat at National Taiwan University, to study irrigation. To pay his tuition, his three brothers left school and worked in their father&#x2019;s barber-shop. Lin entered college just as the campus was roiling with debate over the future of Taiwan and mainland China. For years, young people in Taiwan had been taught that the mainland was run by &#x201c;Communist bandits&#x201d; and &#x201c;demons.&#x201d; The Nationalist Party used this threat to justify martial law, and it committed widespread human rights abuses against political opponents and Communist sympathizers.</p> <p>But as Lin arrived on campus, Taiwan&#x2019;s status was eroding. In July 1971, U.S. president Richard Nixon announced his visit to Beijing. The mainland was gaining influence. In October the United Nations voted to take away Taiwan&#x2019;s seat at the UN General Assembly and give it to the People&#x2019;s Republic, acknowledging that government as the lawful representative of the Chinese people. In this climate, Lin Zhengyi found his voice. He became president of the freshman class and emerged as one of Taiwan&#x2019;s most ardent young activists. At a student rally called &#x201c;Fight the Communist Bandits Sneaking into the United Nations,&#x201d; he took the microphone and appealed for an island-wide protest, an idea so radical in the era of martial law that even his fellow activists couldn&#x2019;t bring themselves to support it. At another event, he vowed to go on a hunger strike, until the dean talked him out of it.</p> <p>When he announced that he was transferring to a military academy, he told reporters, &#x201c;If my decision to join the military can arouse nationalism in every youth&nbsp;&#x2026; then its impact will be immeasurable.&#x201d; He had practical reasons as well: at the military academy he could study for free and receive a stipend.</p> <p>At a friend&#x2019;s house one day during college, Lin met a young woman named Chen Yunying, an activist who was studying literature at National Chengchi University. After they graduated, they married and had a son. Lin spent two years studying for an MBA and then he was assigned to lead a company on the island of Quemoy, known during the Cold War as the &#x201c;lighthouse of the free world,&#x201d; because it was the final spit of land before the Communist shoreline. The two sides had once shelled each other so ferociously that Taiwan&#x2019;s military honeycombed the island with bunkers, underground restaurants, and a hospital carved so deep into the mountain that it was designed to survive a nuclear strike.</p> <p>By the time Lin arrived in 1978, the war was more psychological than physical. The armies still shelled each other, but only on schedule: the mainland fired on odd-numbered days; Taiwan returned fire the rest of the week. Mostly they dueled with propaganda. They blasted each other with enormous, high-powered speakers, and they dropped leaflets from hot-air balloons. They floated softball-sized glass containers to the opposing shores packed with bundles of goods intended to lure defectors with glimpses of prosperity. Taiwan sent pinups and miniature newspapers describing the outside world, clean underwear, pop music cassettes, instructions on how to build a simple radio, and promises of gold coins and glory for anyone willing to defect. The mainland replied with liquor, tea, sweet melons, and pamphlets with photos of smiling Taiwanese diplomats and scientists who had defected to the mainland&#x2014;or, as the Party put it, &#x201c;traded darkness for light.&#x201d;</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>In December 1978, Jimmy Carter announced that the United States was officially recognizing the Communist government in Beijing, and severing formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan.

Each of us will face some loss, sorrow and disappointment in our lives, and <i>The Courage to Grieve </i>provides the specific help we need to enable us to face our grief fully and to recover and grow from the experience. Although the book emphasizes the response to the death of a loved one, <i>The Courage to Grieve </i>can help with every kind of loss and grief. </p><p>Judy Tatelbaum gives us a fresh look at understanding grief, showing us that grief is a natural, inevitable human experience, including all the unexpected, intense and uncomfortable emotions like sorrow, guilt, loneliness, resentment, confusion, or even the temporary loss of the will to live. The emphasis is to clarify and offer help, and the tone is spiritual, optimistic, creative and easy to understand. Judy Tatelbaum provides excellent advice on how to help oneself and others get through the immediate experience of death and the grief that follows, as well as how to understand the special grief of children. Particularly useful are the techniques for completing or "finishing" grief-counteracting the popular misconception that grief never ends. <i>The Courage to Grieve </i>shows us how to live life with the ultimate courage: not fearing death. This book is about so much more than death and grieving it is about life and joy and growth.</p></p><p>Judy Tatelbaum, M.S.W., attended both Syracuse University and the Simmons College School of Social Work in Boston. She worked for several years as a psychiatric social worker at the Payne Whitney Clinic of New York/Cornell Medical Center; the Columbia University School of Social Work; and the Massachusetts Mental Health Center. She now lives in Carmel Valley, California, where she has her private practice.<p>"<i>The Courage to Grieve</i> is a bright candle along a dark, mysterious path on which none of us are equipped to travelcoping with the loss of a loved one. But it contains, I believe, far more than many reasonable and logical suggestions for handling, with courage, our aching grief over the passing of another. This excellent and sensitive book also sheds considerable light on how each of us can learn to live, unafraid, among the always present reminders of our own unavoidable encounter with the shafts of death." -- <i>Og Mandino</i><br><br></p><p>"<i>The Courage to Grieve</i> is a wise and helpful human document. It is written with sympathy and compassion. And it presents sound and sensible insights. The book should be helpful to those experiencing grief. Professionally the book will be a valuable aid to others who counsel with grieving persons." -- <i>Norman Vincent Peale</i><br><br></p><p>"An excellent and tactical, valid book on all the aspects of grief and grief resolution, including important ideas about self-help and avenues to finish unfinished business and teach people how to let go. It is a well-done book written with wisdom and love, and makes people aware that every ending is also a new beginning." -- <i>Elisabeth Kubler-Ross, M.D.</i><br><br></p><p>"I have never read a more clearly written, thorough and understanding book on the subject than <i>The Courage to Grieve</i>. Judy Tatelbaum has reached a desperately needed hand toward us alland her hand is truly helpful." -- <i>Eugenia Price</i><br><br></p><p>"Sooner or later, each of us must experience grief. As unpleasant as it may be it is a reality we must face. <i>The Courage to Grieve</i> by Judy Tatelbaum serves a very important function in helping us face thatreality." -- <i>Lee Salk, Ph.D.</i></p></p><h2>God Cures: 21 Days to Look Good, Live Great, and Love Well</h2><p>The numbers are staggering.

The voices collected here range from Sappho, Horace, and Rumi to Shakespeare and Milton, from Wordsworth, Rilke, Yeats, Rossetti, and Dickinson to Czes&#x142;aw Mi&#x142;osz, Langston Hughes, Yehuda Amichai, Anne Sexton, W. S. Merwin, Maya Angelou, and many more. Such beloved favorites as Gerard Manley Hopkins&#x2019;s &#x201c;Pied Beauty,&#x201d; Robert Frost&#x2019;s &#x201c;Nothing Gold Can Stay,&#x201d; Constantine Cavafy&#x2019;s &#x201c;Ithaka,&#x201d; and Adam Zagajewski&#x2019;s &#x201c;Try to Praise the Mutilated World,&#x201d; mingle with classics from China and Japan, and with traditional Navajo, Aztec, Inuit, and Iroquois poems. Devotional lyrics drawn from the major religious traditions of the world find a place here alongside poetic tributes to autumn and the harvest season that draw attention to nature&#x2019;s bounty and poignant beauty as winter approaches.

She lives in New York City.Foreword by Emily Fragos<br><br>Poets have for centuries offered thanks, praise, loving commemoration, devotion, and prayer for the people and the things of this world. Gratitude is a cherishing of what <i>is</i>, contrasted with what has been or could be. It is both an emotion and a practice, and it necessarily includes keen awareness of the sorrow and pain that give pleasure its value. The poems collected here express enormous joy in celebrating the beauties and relationships of our lives, but homage is also movingly paid to what is lost, to what is hurt, to what is hard to fathom and accept. <br><br><i>Poems of Gratitude </i>is organized in nine chapters with some unavoidable overlapping: <i>Giving Thanks, For Life, For Family, For Love, For Friendship, For Health, For Nature, Reverence, </i>and <i>Thanksgiving</i>. The final section contains several perspectives on the American and Canadian holiday of Thanksgiving, but it also features more general tributes to autumn and the harvest, with poems that revel in nature&#x2019;s bounty and poignant beauty as winter approaches. The concluding poem is one of the most beautiful in the English language: John Keats&#x2019;s &#x201c;Ode to Autumn,&#x201d; where even &#x201c;the small gnats mourn/Among the river sallows&#x201d;<i> </i>at summer&#x2019;s end.<br><br>My hope is that these honest and heartfelt poems from authors ancient and modern, urban and rural, and from around the world, will deepen your own experience of gratitude.

Koterski, S.J.</b><br> &#x2014; Fordham University<br> "Skepticism about the possibility of proving the existence of God often relies on data from modern science.

To paraphrase a popular commercial, this is not your father's old 'natural theology' textbook &#x2014; this is a gripping and compelling account of the best current arguments for theism."<br><br><b>Francis J. Beckwith</b><br> &#x2014; Baylor University<br> "A most original and insightful case for the existence of God. . . Fr.

Jones, CEO of the Public Religion Research Institute, spells out the profound political and cultural consequences of a new reality&#x2014;that America is no longer a majority white Christian nation. &#x201c;Quite possibly the most illuminating text for this election year&#x201d; (<i>The New York Times Book Review</i>).</b><br><br>For most of our nation&#x2019;s history, White Christian America (WCA) set the tone for our national policy and shaped American ideals. But especially since the 1990s, WCA has steadily lost influence, following declines within both its mainline and evangelical branches. Today, America is no longer demographically or culturally a majority white, Christian nation.<br> <br>Drawing on more than four decades of polling data, <i>The End of White Christian America </i>explains and analyzes the waning vitality of WCA. Robert P. Jones argues that the visceral nature of today&#x2019;s most heated issues&#x2014;the vociferous arguments around same-sex marriage and religious and sexual liberty, the rise of the Tea Party following the election of our first black president, and stark disagreements between black and white Americans over the fairness of the criminal justice system&#x2014;can only be understood against the backdrop of white Christians&#x2019; anxieties as America&#x2019;s racial and religious topography shifts around them.<br> <br>Beyond 2016, the descendants of WCA will lack the political power they once had to set the terms of the nation&#x2019;s debate over values and morals and to determine election outcomes. Looking ahead, Jones forecasts the ways that they might adjust to find their place in the new America&#x2014;and the consequences for us all if they don&#x2019;t. &#x201c;Jones&#x2019;s analysis is an insightful combination of history, sociology, religious studies, and political science....This book will be of interest to a wide range of readers across the political spectrum&#x201d; (<i>Library Journal</i>).</p><p>Robert P.
